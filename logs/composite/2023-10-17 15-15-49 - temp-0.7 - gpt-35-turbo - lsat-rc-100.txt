### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses how people compare their income with some norm, which is rising along with actual income.
  It also mentions how people overinvest in acquiring material possessions, at the expense of leisure.
  Passage A also refers to the phenomenon of rivalry, where people are happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improves.
  Passage B discusses how earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful, that they have created value.
  It argues that wanting to create value benefits society, and it brings happiness.
Thought:
  Passage A mentions that people are happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improves.
  Passage B argues that people want to create value, and material wealth is used to show that they are prosperous because they create value.
  Therefore, it is likely that the authors of Passage A and Passage B would describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as wanting to improve their relative position and wanting to create value, respectively.
  The terms "insular" and "cosmopolitan" are not relevant to the discussion.
  The terms "altruistic" and "egocentric" are also not directly relevant to the discussion.
  The terms "misguided" and "admirable" are too judgmental and are not used in the passages.
  The term "primitive" is also not relevant to the discussion.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes the paradox between wealth and happiness and how people compare their income with some norm, which must be rising along with actual income.
  Passage B discusses the theory that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value.
  The authors of both passages analyze the phenomenon of people wanting to make more money than their neighbors.
Thought: 
  The authors of passage A and B do not use negative terms to describe people who want to make more money than their neighbors.
  Passage A suggests that people compare their income with some norm, which must be rising along with actual income, and that people are pushed up by two phenomena: habituation and rivalry.
  Passage B suggests that people want to create value and that they use material wealth to show that they are prosperous because they create value.
  Therefore, the authors of passage A and B would most likely use the terms "rivalrous" and "value-creating" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  The answer is not listed among the choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how people's happiness is affected by their income relative to others in their society.
  Passage B argues that people's desire to earn more money is driven by a desire to create value, rather than a desire to demonstrate superiority.
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B both seem to take a relatively neutral stance on the idea of wanting to make more money than one's neighbors. 
  Passage A suggests that people's desire for relative prosperity is a normal part of human behavior, while Passage B argues that this desire is driven by a desire to create value rather than a desire for superiority.
  Neither passage seems to use particularly negative or positive language to describe this behavior.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that either passage would use terms like "misguided" or "admirable" to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  Similarly, terms like "primitive" and "lucky" do not seem particularly relevant to this topic.
  The other answer choices do not seem to fit with the passages' neutral stance.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the paradox of the relationship between wealth and happiness, and how people compare their income with some norm that rises along with actual income. It also discusses the phenomenon of rivalry, where people are happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improves.

Thought: 
  Both passages discuss the relationship between earning more money and happiness. 
  Passage A describes how people compare their income with some norm. 
  Passage B describes how relative prosperity makes people feel successful. 
  Neither passage uses terms like "insular" or "cosmopolitan" to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors. 
  Passage B suggests that wanting to create value benefits society, so it is unlikely that the authors would use a term like "egocentric" to describe such a person. 
  The authors of Passage A and B do not use terms like "happy" or "miserable" to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors. 
  The authors of Passage A and B do not suggest that a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors is "misguided". 
  The authors of Passage B suggest that wanting to create value benefits society, so it is possible that the authors would use a term like "admirable" to describe such a person.
  The authors of Passage B suggest that the desire to demonstrate superiority may be a remnant of our primeval past. However, they argue that people use material wealth to show not just that they are prosperous, but that they are prosperous because they create value. This suggests that the authors would not use a term like "primitive" to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the authors of Passage B would describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors as "admirable".
Action: Answer("D")

  However, Passage B argues that wanting to create value benefits society and that it is evidence of a desire to create value, which is not an ignoble tendency.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage B would most likely use the term "admirable" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  The authors of Passage A do not provide a clear answer to this question.
  None of the answer choices accurately reflect the ideas presented in either passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and B discuss research on happiness and wealth, specifically how people compare themselves to others in terms of income and how relative prosperity can lead to happiness. 
Thought:
  The authors of Passage A discuss how people compare themselves to others in terms of income, and how people are generally happier when they earn more money and are more prosperous than those around them. They describe the phenomenon of rivalry and how people want to make more money than their neighbors. 
  The authors of Passage B argue that the desire to make more money than one's neighbors is not necessarily driven by a desire for one-upmanship, but rather a desire to create value. 
  Neither passage provides a specific pair of terms to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors. 
  However, based on the content of the passages, it is unlikely that the authors of either passage would describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "altruistic" or "happy." 
  "Misguided" would be a negative term that the authors of Passage B might use to describe someone who is solely focused on making more money than their neighbors, while "admirable" might be a positive term they could use to describe someone who wants to create value.

  Passage A discusses research on the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  Passage B adds to the discussion of wealth and happiness by exploring the idea that people derive happiness from feeling successful and creating value.
  Neither passage provides clear indications of how the authors would describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Thought: 
  The passages do not provide sufficient information to determine how the authors would describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  It is possible that the authors might describe such a person as misguided or egocentric, as both passages express skepticism about the idea that money alone brings happiness.
  However, it is also possible that the authors might describe such a person more positively, as someone who is driven to create value and contribute to society.
  Without more information, it is difficult to determine which set of terms the authors are more likely to use.
  Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss research and theories about the relationship between income, wealth, and happiness.
  Neither passage provides an explicit definition of the term "a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors".

Thought:
  Passage A describes the phenomenon of rivalry and how people compare their income to a norm. It suggests that people who want to make more money than their neighbors are motivated by a desire to improve their relative position. 
  Passage B argues that people who want to earn more money are motivated by a desire to create value and be successful. It suggests that this desire is not necessarily selfish or egocentric, but rather benefits society as a whole.
  Neither passage uses the terms "insular," "cosmopolitan," "altruistic," "egocentric," "misguided," "admirable," "lucky," or "primitive" to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  Based on the information in the passages, it is most likely that the authors of Passage A would describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors as "rivalrous," while the authors of Passage B would describe such a person as "motivated by a desire to create value and be successful."
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss research and theories related to the relationship between wealth, happiness, and social comparison. 
  There is a discussion of people's tendency to compare their income and possessions to those of others, and the effect this has on happiness levels.
  The authors suggest that people may want to make more money than their neighbors as a way of demonstrating their success and creating value.
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B seem to view people who want to make more money than their neighbors in a positive light.
  They suggest that this desire is related to a desire to create value and to feel successful.
  Neither passage uses terms like "insular" or "cosmopolitan" to describe such people.
  "Altruistic" and "egocentric" both suggest a moral judgment, but neither seems to fit the authors' view of people who want to make more money than their neighbors.
  "Misguided" is too negative, and "admirable" is too positive, to describe the authors' view of such people.
  "Lucky" and "primitive" are not relevant to the discussion.
  Therefore, none of the pairs of terms is a good fit for the authors' views on this topic.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: Based on what can be inferred from their titles, the relationship between the documents in which one of the following pairs Js most ,analogpus to the relationship between passage A and passage B?

  D: The Troublesome History of Cameras in the Courtroom "The Laudable Motives Behind Televised courtroom, Proceedings"
  E: Why Cameras Should Be Banned from the Courtroom "The Inevitability of Televised Courtroom Proceedings"
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses jury nullification and the problems associated with it, such as lack of knowledge about how often it occurs and the potential for jurors to make decisions based on insufficient evidence, among other issues.
  Passage B discusses the potential benefits of jury nullification, such as providing a safety valve for overzealous prosecution and indicating to the legislature when a law may be unjust or too broad.
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss the topic of jury nullification, but they approach it from different perspectives.
  Passage A discusses the problems associated with jury nullification, whereas Passage B discusses the potential benefits.
  Therefore, the relationship between the documents is one of contrast or opposition.
  The answer is most likely not A or B, as they both discuss the pros and cons of a particular issue, rather than being in opposition to each other.
  C and D both discuss cameras in the courtroom, which is unrelated to the topic of jury nullification.
  E discusses whether cameras should be allowed in the courtroom, which is also unrelated to the topic of jury nullification.
  Therefore, none of the available choices is a good match for the relationship between Passage A and Passage B.
  The most likely answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses jury nullification and its potential problems.
  Passage B discusses the potential benefits of jury nullification and its role in assisting the legislature.
  A: The two passages both discuss cameras in the courtroom, but they have different perspectives on the topic. Passage A seems to be against cameras in the courtroom, while Passage B seems to be in favor of them.
  B: The two passages both discuss cameras in the courtroom, but they have different perspectives on the topic. Passage A seems to be against cameras in the courtroom, while Passage B seems to be in favor of them.
  C: The two passages both discuss cameras in the courtroom, but they have different perspectives on the topic. Passage A seems to be against cameras in the courtroom, while Passage B seems to be in favor of them.

  E: The two passages both discuss cameras in the courtroom, but they have different perspectives on the topic. Passage A seems to be against cameras in the courtroom, while Passage B seems to be in favor of them.
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss a legal issue from different perspectives.
  They seem to present opposing views on the issue, with Passage A discussing the potential problems with jury nullification and Passage B discussing its potential benefits and role in assisting the legislature.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two passages is most analogous to the relationship between Passage B and choice C, "How Televising Courtroom Proceedings Can Assist the Law," which also discusses the potential benefits of a legal issue from a different perspective.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B are related to each other because they both discuss the concept of jury nullification.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and how secondary substances give plants their distinct smells and tastes. 
  Secondary substances are diverse and have no known role in the internal chemical processes of a plant's growth or metabolism. 
  Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they attract pollinating insects to blossoms, while others are biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, mostly insects.
Thought: 
  The passage explains that some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they attract pollinating insects to blossoms. These substances signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances are biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, mostly insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still, other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other harmful substance. Therefore, some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")

  Choice A is the best answer.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  The primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  The secondary substances are diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. 
  Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. 
  Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects.
  Insects have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today.
  As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants. 

Thought: 
  The passage explains that secondary substances play a vital role in the lives of plants.
  Secondary substances not only give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, they are also used as a defense mechanism against insects.
  Insects play a significant role in the evolution of secondary substances in plants.
  Insects have evolved ways to circumvent the plants' defenses.
  As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect.

A: The passage provides support for this inference by stating that secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism but still play a vital role in the lives of various kinds of plants.
B: The passage provides support for this inference by stating that some secondary substances are biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects.
C: The passage does not provide support for this inference. Insects are able to identify the plants by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both, which is mentioned in the passage.
D: The passage provides support for this inference by stating that some secondary substances are toxic to insects and have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but have survived in only a few species.
E: The passage provides support for this inference by stating that some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale means that the more a business produces, the more efficient it becomes.
  The more efficient a business is, the more it can produce.
  The parable of the pin factory illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Thought: 
  Option A describes a situation where a publishing house relaxes standards. This doesn't illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Option B describes a situation where a bee colony uses guard bees to collect more nectar to feed a larger colony. This does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Option C describes a situation where a school district accommodates more students by switching to a year-round operation. This does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Option D describes a situation where the lobster industry is able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps because of advances in technology. This does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Option E describes a situation where a large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. This illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale because the more ants there are, the more efficient the colony becomes at producing and collecting resources, which in turn enables the colony to grow even larger.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Criticism: 
  The concept of increasing returns to scale is about the relationship between a business's output and efficiency, not about the growth of a colony of ants. 
  Option E illustrates positive feedback, but not necessarily increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes increasing returns to scale as a concept where bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. There is a natural tendency toward monopoly because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. 
Thought: 
  The best example that illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage is the lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. As the technology advances, the lobster industry is able to produce more lobsters with a similar amount of resources. This is an example of increasing returns because with more production, the industry can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale are achieved by increased size and specialization, leading to greater efficiency and productivity.
Thought:
  A: Relaxing editorial standards would not lead to increased efficiency or productivity, and would likely lead to lower quality work.
  B: The bee colony example involves specialization and increased productivity, but it does not involve increased size.
  C: Year-round operation would increase the capacity of a single building, but it does not involve increased specialization or productivity.
  D: The lobster industry example involves increased productivity due to technological advances, but it does not involve increased size or specialization.
  E: The ant colony example involves increased size due to division and specialization of labor, leading to greater efficiency and productivity.
  Therefore, the ant colony example best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage.
  The answer is E.
Criticism:
  The ant colony example involves increased size and specialization, but it does not involve increased productivity or efficiency.
  A better example might be a factory that increases its size and specialization to produce more goods at a lower cost per unit.
  Therefore, Answer("None of the Above") is not the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory example shows how large factories can achieve greater efficiency through specialization.
  Increasing returns can lead to natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The idea of free markets depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
Thought:
  Increasing returns to scale is the idea that the bigger a firm, the more efficient it becomes, and thus it can produce more at a lower cost per unit.
  Example C, where a school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, does not illustrate the concept, as it does not involve a business firm.
  Example D, where the lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through, does not illustrate the concept, as it does not involve the idea of a larger firm.
  Example E, where a large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies, illustrates the concept of increasing returns, as the ant colony becomes larger and more prosperous as it grows and divides.
  Example A, where a publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere, does not illustrate the concept, as it does not involve the idea of a larger firm.
  Example B, where a large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, enabling the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar, does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale, as it does not involve the idea of a larger firm.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The concept of increasing returns to scale means that the bigger the firm, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more output the firm can produce per worker.
  A: This option describes how a publishing house is able to improve the productivity of its editors but does not describe how it can produce more output per worker by increasing its size.
  B: This option describes how a bee colony can produce more nectar by dividing up the work but does not describe how a firm can produce more output per worker by increasing its size.
  C: This option describes how a school district can accommodate more students by switching to year-round operation, but it does not describe how a firm can produce more output per worker by increasing its size.
  D: This option describes how the lobster industry can catch more lobsters a day with the same number of traps by using technology, but it does not describe how a firm can produce more output per worker by increasing its size.
  E: This option describes how a large ant colony can divide and produce more colonies, which together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony. However, it does not describe how a firm can produce more output per worker by increasing its size.
Thought:
  Increasing returns to scale means that the bigger the firm, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more output the firm can produce per worker.
  Option A, B, C, D, and E do not describe how a firm can produce more output per worker by increasing its size.
  Therefore, none of the options best illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Since 'None of the Above' is not a valid option, the best answer is the most likely answer, which is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
Criticism:
  The lobster industry in option D is able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps due to technological advances, not necessarily because of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, none of the options best illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Since 'None of the Above' is not a valid option, there is no best answer to this question.
Action: None of the above.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  The Pin Factory example illustrates how a larger factory can achieve greater efficiency through specialization of labor.
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale means that as a firm's size increases, its efficiency and productivity also increase.
  The ant colony example does not involve a firm or an increase in efficiency, so it is not the best illustration.
  The publishing house example involves a decrease in standards and fewer editors, which contradicts the idea of increasing returns to scale.
  The bee colony example involves specialization of labor and increased productivity, but it is not about a firm or industry.
  The school district example involves a different method of accommodating more students, but it is not about a firm or industry.
  The lobster industry example involves technological advances that increase productivity and efficiency, which is a good illustration of increasing returns to scale.
Criticism: 
  The lobster industry example is a good illustration of increasing returns to scale, but it does not involve a firm, as the question asked.
  The bee colony example involves specialization of labor, which is a key component of increasing returns to scale, and can be seen as a good illustration despite not involving a firm.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which refers to the idea that as a business grows, the productivity of its workers increases.
  A: This option describes a reduction in productivity, not an increase, so it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: This option describes a situation where the productivity of the bees and the size of the colony both increase, but it does not involve human workers or businesses, which are the focus of the passage. 
  C: This option describes a way to increase capacity but not the productivity of workers, so it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale. 
  D: This option describes a situation where the productivity of the workers increases due to advances in technology, which is consistent with the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  E: This option describes a natural system, not a business, and it does not involve human workers or the production of goods or services, so it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale. 
Thought:
  The concept of increasing returns to scale refers to the idea that as a business grows, the productivity of its workers increases.
  Option D describes a situation where the lobster industry is able to catch more lobsters per trap, which suggests that the industry is becoming more productive as it grows.
  Therefore, option D best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which refers to the idea that as a company or industry grows, it becomes more efficient and is able to produce more per worker.
  A: This option describes a situation where the productivity of editors is improved by relaxing standards, but it does not describe a situation where increasing returns to scale are occurring.
  B: This option describes a situation where a bee colony is able to collect more nectar by assigning some bees to guard nectar sources, which enables the colony to divide up the work of processing the nectar more efficiently. This example illustrates increasing returns to scale.
  C: This option describes a situation where a school district increases the number of students it can accommodate by switching to year-round operation, but it does not describe a situation where increasing returns to scale are occurring.
  D: This option describes a situation where the lobster industry is able to catch more lobsters per day because of advances in technology, but it does not describe a situation where increasing returns to scale are occurring.
  E: This option describes a situation where a large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies, which eventually grow and divide further. This example does not describe a situation where increasing returns to scale are occurring.
Thought: 
  The question asks for an example that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Option B describes a situation where a bee colony is able to collect more nectar by assigning some bees to guard nectar sources, which enables the colony to divide up the work of processing the nectar more efficiently.
  This example illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale, as the bee colony is able to produce more nectar per bee by dividing up the work more efficiently.
  Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Criticism: 
  There is no obvious flaw in the logic or reasoning used to select option B as the best answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes increasing returns to scale.
  The Pin Factory is an example of increasing returns to scale.
Thought:
  The Pin Factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. This is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Option A describes decreased productivity, not increased productivity, so it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Option B describes how the bee colony is able to collect more nectar, but it does not illustrate increased productivity through specialization, so it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Option C describes how a school district accommodates more students in a single building by switching to year-round operation. This does not illustrate increased productivity through specialization, so it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Option D describes how the lobster industry is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because of advances in technology. This does not illustrate increased productivity through specialization, so it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Option E describes how a large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. This illustrates increasing productivity through specialization, so it illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Criticism:
  The example in option E is somewhat vague and not as clear-cut as the example of the Pin Factory in the passage. However, it still illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale through specialization.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  The Pin Factory example illustrates that bigger factories can produce more per worker, and achieve lower costs.
Thought:
  A: The publishing house is able to employ fewer editors by relaxing standards. This is an example of decreasing returns to scale, because fewer editors means less productivity.
  B: The large bee colony uses some bees to guard nectar sources, which enables the colony to collect more nectar. This is an example of increasing returns to scale because the larger colony can divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: The school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time. This is an example of a scheduling strategy but not a production strategy. It is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  D: The lobster industry is able to catch more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because of advances in technology. This is an example of technological progress but not increasing returns to scale. 
  E: The large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony. This is an example of increasing returns to scale because the larger colony can divide up the work more efficiently.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: A large ant colony dividing and producing two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.

Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about the development of writing, specifically the precursor to writing in the form of tokens.
  The tablets from Uruk used abstract symbols rather than pictographs.
  The sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross.
Thought: 
  The author mentions the sign for "sheep" as an example of an abstract symbol.
  The author does not give any indication that another sign could have been used instead.
  The author does not compare the sign for "sheep" to the sign for "metal."
  The author does not give any indication that the way in which the sign represents its meaning is related to sheep being an agricultural commodity.
  The author does not mention any scientific scrutiny or lack thereof of the sign for "sheep."
  The author does not make any connection between the abstract nature of the sign and political life.
  Therefore, the author does not agree with any of the statements regarding the sign for "sheep."
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the development of writing in ancient Sumeria.
  The sign for "sheep" is a circled cross, rather than an image of a sheep.
Thought: 
  The author does not explicitly state their opinion on the sign for "sheep."
  However, the author does note that the abstract symbols used in Sumerian writing were not just pictographs but also included numerous abstract symbols.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the author would agree that the abstract nature of the sign for "sheep" is not unusual given the overall use of abstract symbols in Sumerian writing.
  A, B, C, D, and E are all speculative and not supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of abstract symbols in cuneiform writing found on clay tablets from Uruk, which date back to about 3000 B.C.
  The sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross.
Thought: 
  The passage does not provide a clear indication of the author's opinion on the sign for "sheep."
  However, the passage does mention that the writing on the tablets uses relatively few pictographs and numerous abstract symbols, which suggests that the author might view the use of abstract symbols as an important feature of the writing system.
  The passage also notes that the tokens used in the precursor to the cuneiform writing system were often inscribed with symbols and that the token system was eventually replaced by a system of marks on clay tablets.
  These developments suggest that the people who used the language expressed by cuneiform writing were capable of creating and adapting abstract symbols to represent their ideas.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
Criticism: 
  While the passage does not provide a clear indication of the author's opinion on the sign for "sheep," the logic used to arrive at statement A seems reasonable based on the information provided.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the early development of writing in ancient Sumeria.
  The sign for "sheep" in cuneiform is a circled cross.

  None of the options seem to accurately reflect the information provided in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is "None of the above."
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of abstract symbols in Sumerian writing.
  The sign for "sheep" in Sumerian writing is a circled cross.
Thought:
  The author is likely to agree that the sign for "sheep" in Sumerian writing is an abstract symbol that does not resemble a sheep.
  Option A is not supported by the passage and is irrelevant to the discussion of the sign for "sheep".
  Option B is also not discussed in the passage and is irrelevant to the discussion of the sign for "sheep".
  Option C suggests a reason for why sheep are important in Sumerian society, but it does not address the nature of the sign for "sheep".
  Option D is partially true, as the tokens and their inscriptions were overlooked by archaeologists until Schmandt-Besserat's work.
  Option E is also not discussed in the passage and is irrelevant to the discussion of the sign for "sheep".
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The way in which it represents its meaning was not the subject of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat. 
Criticism: 
  This answer is not a direct statement from the passage, but it is a logical inference based on the information provided. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the development of writing in ancient civilizations.
  The sign for "sheep" in the Sumerian language is not a pictograph of a sheep, but an abstract symbol.
Thought: 
  The author of the passage is most likely to agree that the sign for "sheep" gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning because the passage states that "numerous abstract symbols are used" and "the sign for 'metal' is a crescent with five lines."
  A, C, D, and E are not supported by the passage.
Answer: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience have implications for the way we think about the law, particularly the idea of retribution as a justification for punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and the concept of free will, arguing that actions can still be considered free as long as they are not constrained by external sources.
Thought:
  Both passages are concerned with answering questions related to the implications of neuroscience on the law and the concept of free will.
  Passage A argues that the law should focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution, given that neuroscience suggests that people's behavior is largely influenced by factors outside their control.
  Passage B argues that actions can still be considered free even in a deterministic world, as long as they are not constrained by external sources, which could include certain mental disorders.
  Therefore, both passages are concerned with answering the question of whether scientific research into the brain has implications regarding freedom of the will.
  The answer is B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
Criticism:
  There is no explicit mention of punishment for actions outside of someone's control, so A cannot be the answer.
  While Passage A does argue against retribution as a justification for punishment, the question is not whether it is legitimate, but whether it is compatible with the findings of neuroscience, so D is not the answer.
  Passage A does mention deterrence, but it is not specifically about whether actions that are not free can be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment, so C is not the answer.
  Although Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will, it is not specifically about cases where someone else physically forced the actor to perform an action, so E is not the answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution as a justification of punishment, and instead focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought: 
  Both passages discuss the implications of scientific research into the brain on the concept of free will and the law.
  Passage A argues that the law should abandon retribution as a justification for punishment and focus on deterring future harms, which is related to the question of whether people should be punished for actions that are outside of their control.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the law should abandon retribution as the dominant justification for punishment and instead focus on deterring future harms. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world, arguing that actions can be free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought: 
  Both passages are concerned with answering the question of whether or not scientific research into the brain has implications regarding freedom of the will and the justification for punishment in the legal system. 
  Passage A argues that the law should shift away from retribution as a justification for punishment and instead focus on deterrence because neuroscience suggests that people may not have free will in the way that the law assumes. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world and argues that actions can still be considered free as long as they are not constrained, regardless of the deterministic nature of the world. 
  Both passages are discussing the relationship between determinism and free will in the context of the legal system. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in either passage that the question of whether or not people should be punished for actions outside of their control is a central concern.
  Additionally, while Passage A argues that the law should focus on deterrence rather than retribution, it does not specifically address the question of whether or not punishment for actions outside of one's control is justified.
  Passage B discusses the distinction between free and constrained actions, but it does not specifically address the question of whether or not actions that are not free can be deterred by the threat of punishment.
  While Passage A does address the question of whether or not retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment, it does so in the context of discussing the implications of neuroscience research on the legal system, rather than as the central concern of the passage.
  Finally, Passage B does address the question of whether or not an action can be considered free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it, but it does not argue that this is the central concern of the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the law should focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought: 
  Both passages are concerned with the implications of scientific research into the brain on the concept of free will and the law.
  Passage A argues that the law should focus on deterrence rather than retribution due to new findings in neuroscience that suggest that people's behavior is caused solely by the operations of the brain.
  Passage B argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, and it is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free.
  The two passages are related in that they both discuss the concept of free will and how it relates to the law and scientific research into the brain.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
Criticism: 
  There is no direct mention of punishment for actions that are outside of someone's control, so option A is not a primary concern of either passage.
  Although deterrence is discussed in Passage A, the primary concern is the implications of scientific research into the brain on the concept of free will and the law, rather than the effectiveness of deterrence for actions that are not free.
  While the concept of retribution is mentioned in Passage A, the primary concern is whether it is a legitimate justification for punishment in light of the findings of neuroscience.
  Although Passage B discusses the distinction between free and constrained actions, it does not directly address the question of whether actions that are not free can be deterred effectively.
  Option E is mentioned in Passage B, but it is not the primary concern of either passage.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to
Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work
  B: put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work
  C: acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works
  D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works
  E: explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on Russian literary criticism during his time.
- Dostoyevsky believed in the importance of reality as a source for literature, but also believed that reality was not limited to the tangible.
- He believed that the fantastic and the real could be intertwined in literature.
- Dostoyevsky believed that artistic merit was crucial and that the utilitarian view of literature was flawed.
Thought:
- The question asks for Dostoyevsky's attitude to be most softened if the radical critics were to do something specific.
- A: Drawing a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy would not align with Dostoyevsky's belief that the two can be intertwined.
- B: Putting clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects still values utilitarianism over artistic merit, which Dostoyevsky disagrees with.
- C: Acknowledging the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality would go against Dostoyevsky's belief that reality is a crucial source for literature.
- D: Recognizing the full significance of artistic merit aligns with Dostoyevsky's belief that artistic merit is crucial.
- E: Explaining more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is would not change Dostoyevsky's belief that reality is shaped by the person who experiences it.
- Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Criticism:
- The passage does not specifically state what would soften Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view, so the answer could be open to interpretation.
- However, Dostoyevsky's emphasis on artistic merit and his rejection of utilitarianism suggest that he would value a recognition of artistic merit over a focus on utilitarianism.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position on the debate between Russian literary critics.
  He believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went beyond the one prevailing among radical critics.
  For Dostoyevsky, reality was shaped by the person who experienced it, and there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky believed that the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless since reality was shaped by the person who experienced it.
  He believed that literary works must stand or fall on their "artistic merit."
  Therefore, if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view would be most softened.
  The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Criticism: 
  There is no major flaw in the logic or reasoning used to arrive at the answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky had a different view on art and reality than the radical critics during his time in Russia.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was not limited to the tangible and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  He believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world and that the fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.
  Dostoyevsky rejected the radical critics' demand that art must serve a particular political view and that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society.
  Dostoyevsky defined artistic as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts.
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view could be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit" and that utilitarian claims that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear were a contradiction in terms.
  Therefore, if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view would be most softened.
  The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Criticism:
  There is no flaw in the logic or reasoning of this answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a unique position in Russian literary criticism; he believed that reality was the crucial source of literature, but he understood reality in a different way from the radical critics.
  The radical critics believed that art had to be useful, while Dostoyevsky believed that art could not be assigned a specific political goal.
  For Dostoyevsky, artistry was about being able to express thoughts through characters and images in a way that readers could understand.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view that literature must be useful to society, and that it was more important for a literary work to have artistic merit. Therefore, to soften his attitude towards the radical critics' view, they would have to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct. The passage states that Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Therefore, recognizing the full significance of artistic merit would be the best way for the radical critics to soften Dostoyevsky's attitude towards their view.

  Dostoyevsky believed that literary works should be judged based on their artistic merit, so it is likely that the answer involves this idea.
  Option A suggests drawing a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy, but Dostoyevsky believed that reality was more than just tangible and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Option B suggests putting clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects, but Dostoyevsky believed that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals.
  Option C suggests acknowledging the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality, but Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  Option E suggests explaining more fully the demand that reality be depicted as it is, but Dostoyevsky believed that this demand was meaningless.
  Option D suggests recognizing the full significance of artistic merit, which aligns with Dostoyevsky's position on literary criticism.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.
  B: Katherine Dunham's ballets were distinct from others produced in North America in that they incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures.
  C: Katherine Dunham's expertise as an anthropologist allowed her to use Caribbean and African dance traditions to express the aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers.
  D: The innovative research methods of Katherine Dunham made possible her discovery that the dance traditions of the Caribbean were derived from earlier African dance traditions.
  E: Katherine Dunham's anthropological and choreographic expertise enabled her to make contributions that altered the landscape of modern dance in North America.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music, specifically the jazz genre. 
  The passage notes that Morrison uses the structure of jazz music in the narration of the novel. 
  The passage suggests that Morrison's approach to narration is unique in the context of literature about nonliterary arts.
Thought: 
  The author argues that Jazz is unique in its attempt to structure a novel after a musical genre, specifically jazz. 
  The passage suggests that this is a groundbreaking approach to narration. 
  The author implies that other novels about nonliterary arts and artists do not attempt to structure their narratives in this way.
  Therefore, if any of the answer choices suggests that this is not the case, it would contradict the author's assertion.
  A: This answer choice supports the author's assertion that Morrison intentionally simulates a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story. It does not contradict the author's assertion and is not the correct answer.
  B: This answer choice is irrelevant to the author's assertion and is not the correct answer.
  C: This answer choice contradicts the author's assertion that Morrison's approach to narration is unique in the context of literature about nonliterary arts.
  D: This answer choice is too vague and general to be relevant to the author's assertion.
  E: This answer choice is also irrelevant to the author's assertion and is not the correct answer.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question. 
Criticism: 
  The author does not make this claim in the passage. 
  While the author does suggest that Morrison's approach to narration is unique in the context of literature about nonliterary arts, the author does not make a sweeping generalization about all such literature. 
  Therefore, this answer choice is not correct. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Toni Morrison's novel Jazz uses the structure of jazz music as a framework for its narration.
  The author of the passage is comparing the structure of Jazz to the structure of a jazz ensemble.
  A: This choice supports the author's assertion that Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: This choice is not relevant to the comparison the author is making between Jazz and a jazz ensemble.
  C: This choice is too broad and does not specifically address the comparison the author is making between Jazz and a jazz ensemble.
  D: This choice is too general and does not specifically address the comparison the author is making between Jazz and a jazz ensemble.
  E: This choice is not relevant to the comparison the author is making between Jazz and a jazz ensemble.
Thought: 
  The author is comparing the structure of Jazz to the structure of a jazz ensemble.
  The author argues that the narrator in Jazz is analogous to a composer in a jazz ensemble.
  Just as a composer sets the framework for a jazz ensemble's improvisations, the narrator in Jazz sets the framework for the characters' stories.
  Therefore, if choice A were true, it would support the author's comparison between Jazz and a jazz ensemble and reinforce the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and the way in which its narrative structure is similar to that of a jazz composition. 
  The narrator's voice alternates between third-person omniscience and first-person lyricism of key characters. 
  The central characters are given responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but their sections are set off by quotation marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.
Thought: 
  The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is that the narrative structure of Jazz is analogous to the playing of a jazz band, where individual musicians' improvisations and solos are performed within a composer's frame and with quotation marks around their improvisations and solos. 
  If A were true, it would support the author's assertion that Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  If B, C, D, or E were true, they would not directly support or refute the author's assertion about the narrative structure of Jazz.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, which is structured like a jazz composition. 
  The author of the passage compares the narration of Jazz to the playing of a jazz hand. 
Thought:
  The author asserts that Jazz is structured like a jazz composition. 
  The structure of the novel is like a jazz hand. 
  Morrison's use of narration simulates the style of a genius of music. 
  Therefore, the assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if it were not true that Morrison's use of narration in Jazz simulates the style of a genius of music.
  The only option that would do that is E, which is irrelevant to the author's assertion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its structure, which is compared to the structure of jazz music.
  Lines 11-16 describe the way in which the narrative structure of Jazz is similar to the structure of a jazz composition.
  A: This choice suggests that the author intentionally wrote Jazz to simulate a style of jazz performance.
  B: This choice discusses African American novelists who may have based their work on the structure of blues music, which is not the focus of the passage.
  C: This choice makes a broad assertion about novels that is not supported by the passage.
  D: This choice suggests that any novel can be found to be somewhat musical, which is not the focus of the passage.
  E: This choice discusses the frequency of African American writers who have written about music, which is not the focus of the passage.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its structure, which is compared to the structure of jazz music.
  Lines 11-16 describe the way in which the narrative structure of Jazz is similar to the structure of a jazz composition.
  The author may be asserting that Jazz is unique in its attempt to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  Therefore, if A were true, it would support the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how it is structurally similar to jazz music.
  The author compares the novel's narration to the improvisation of musicians within the framework of a composer's composition.
Thought:
  The author is discussing how Morrison has used the structure of jazz music to create a narrative that is both individualistic and unified.
  The author argues that Morrison has achieved this by allowing the characters to speak in first-person while also maintaining control over the narrative as a whole.
  The author believes that this technique is similar to the way jazz musicians improvise within a composer's composition.
  The author is not discussing other novels or authors, so options B, C, D, and E are not relevant to the question.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Criticism:
  The passage does not explicitly state that Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  However, the author does describe how the structure of the novel is similar to the structure of jazz music, so it can be inferred that Morrison was intentionally using this technique.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's use of music as the structuring principle for her novel Jazz and the connection between music and literature.
  A: This option suggests that the author intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: This option suggests that some African American novelists sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music in the past.
  C: This option suggests that all novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: This option suggests that depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: This option suggests that a smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Thought: 
  The author discusses Toni Morrison's use of music as the structuring principle for her novel Jazz.
  The author also discusses the connection between music and literature in general.
  None of the other options directly relate to the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
  Therefore, none of the options seem likely to be true.
  However, option A is the closest in meaning to the author's assertion in lines 11-16, as it suggests that the author intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  Therefore, option A is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music.
  Lines 11-16 discuss how no other African American writer had used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Morrison did so in Jazz. 
  A: This is a statement about the author's intention in writing Jazz.
  B: This statement is not mentioned in the passage.
  C: This statement is too broad and does not relate to the specific topic of the passage.
  D: This statement is too general and does not relate to the specific topic of the passage.
  E: This statement is not mentioned in the passage.
Thought:
  Lines 11-16 discuss how Morrison's Jazz is unique in its use of a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
  None of the other choices accurately restate this assertion.
  Therefore, none of the other choices would be most called into question.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Criticism:
  N/A
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, which uses jazz music as a structuring principle for the narrative.
  The narrator of Jazz shifts between third-person omniscience and first-person lyricism of key characters, with the characters' sections set off by quotation marks.
Thought:
  The author asserts that Jazz "is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances." (lines 11-13).
  The author compares the narration of Jazz to a jazz composition in which the composer constructs the piece with individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. (lines 19-22).
  The author notes that, in Jazz, the narrator allows the central characters to speak, but their sections are set off by quotation marks, indicating the narrator's mastery over the narrative as a whole. (lines 15-16).
  Therefore, if the author were to assert that even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story, it would be most closely related to the author's argument about the structure of Jazz.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to the structure of jazz music.
  A: This choice is close to the assertion made in the passage, but it is not entirely accurate. The author does not explicitly state that the intention was to simulate a style of jazz performance.
  B: The passage does not mention any other African American novelists who based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
  C: The passage does not make a generalization about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists.
  D: The passage mentions that literature aspired to the condition of music, but this choice is too broad and not specific to the assertion in lines 11-16.
  E: The passage does not compare the number of African American writers to non-African American writers who have written novels about music.
Thought: 
  Lines 11-16 discuss how Toni Morrison drew upon jazz music as the structuring principle for her novel Jazz.
  The author compares this to the way in which composer and conductor Duke Ellington constructed his compositions with individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind.
  The author asserts that Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  Thus, if the author's assertion is true, then it must be the case that Morrison's use of jazz as a structuring principle for Jazz is a unique and innovative approach to novel writing.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the function of the third paragraph within the passage as a whole?
Choices:
  A: to refute traditional interpretations of certain artifacts
  B: to present evidence that undermines a theory
  C: to provide examples that support an argument
  D: to contrast several different modes of expression
  E: to enumerate specific instances in which a phenomenon recurred

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes how scientists attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. They discovered that the orbit they predicted was incorrect, and hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune. Later, they discovered Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
Thought:
  The question asks us to find the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  In the case of the discovery of Neptune, scientists predicted the existence of another planet to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations, and later discovered Neptune in the precise place it was predicted to be.
  Looking at the answer choices:
  A: This answer choice describes Galileo's theory of tides, which falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  B: This answer choice describes how Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  C: This answer choice describes how Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, which was later confirmed by the discovery of a large impact crater. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  D: This answer choice describes how Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  E: This answer choice describes how Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third undetected particle during the decay of a neutron, which was later confirmed. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers discovered the planet Neptune.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
  B: Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
  C: Walter Alvarez's postulation about the extinction of dinosaurs is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery of reversed magnetic fields is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of a third undetected particle is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus but found it to be incorrect.
  Astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Uranus to bring their calculations into alignment.
  The planet, Neptune, was discovered in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is when astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Uranus and later discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  The answer is: B.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the logic used to arrive at the answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's philosophy of science, which emphasizes the power of negative evidence and the importance of searching for evidence that would disprove scientific theories.
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune and the importance of auxiliary assumptions in scientific predictions.
Thought:
  In the discovery of Neptune, astronomers made predictions about its orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, but their predictions were incorrect.
  One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions, and they changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, which led to the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, the most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune would be one where scientists made predictions based on assumptions, but their predictions were incorrect due to an error in their assumptions.
  Option C is about Walter Alvarez postulating that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples, and later discovering evidence of a large impact crater. This episode is not about making predictions based on assumptions, so it is not the most analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option A is about Galileo's theory of tides, which falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two. This episode is not about making predictions based on assumptions, so it is not the most analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option B is about Edwin Hubble discovering that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right by observing "variable stars". This episode is not about making predictions based on assumptions, so it is not the most analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option D is about Bernard Brunhes discovering rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field, and concluding that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past. This episode is not about making predictions based on assumptions, so it is not the most analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option E is about Wolfgang Pauli postulating the existence of a third undetected particle during the decay of a neutron, which was later confirmed. This episode is not about making predictions based on assumptions, so it is not the most analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Walter Alvarez postulating that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples, and later discovering evidence of a large impact crater. (Note: This is the most analogous episode to the discovery of Neptune, but it is not a perfect analogy.)

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes how astronomers discovered Neptune by hypothesizing its existence based on discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus.
Thought:
  The question is asking us to identify which scientific episode is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as described in passage B. 
  In Passage B, astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet to explain discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus. Later, they discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Answer choice A describes Galileo's false prediction about ocean tides, which does not involve the discovery of a new planet or object.
  Answer choice B describes Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy, which also does not involve the discovery of a new planet or object.
  Answer choice C describes Walter Alvarez's theory about an asteroid causing the extinction of the dinosaurs, which involves discovering evidence of an impact crater, but not the discovery of a new planet or object.
  Answer choice D describes Bernard Brunhes' discovery of rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field, which also does not involve the discovery of a new planet or object.
  Answer choice E describes the postulation of a new particle to explain an apparent violation of the law of conservation of energy, which is a different kind of scientific discovery than the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, based on the given information, the most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune, as described in passage B, is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune based on discrepancies between predicted and observed orbits of Uranus.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides incorrectly predicted the number of high tides per day.
  B: Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is a galaxy in its own right by observing "variable stars."
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated an asteroid impact caused the extinction of dinosaurs based on high levels of iridium in rock core samples, which was later supported by discovery of a large impact crater.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third undetected particle to explain discrepancies in the energy of a neutron decay.
Thought:
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune based on discrepancies in predicted and observed orbits.
  Passage B is most analogous to answer choice A because both involve discrepancies in predictions - Galileo's theory of tides predicted only one high tide per day, whereas observations showed two, and the predicted orbit of Uranus was incorrect.
  Answer choice B is not analogous as it does not involve discrepancies in predictions.
  Answer choice C is not analogous as it is based on observations of iridium levels and the subsequent discovery of a large impact crater, rather than discrepancies in predictions.
  Answer choice D is not analogous as it is based on observations of magnetized rocks, rather than discrepancies in predictions.
  Answer choice E is not analogous as it is based on discrepancies in energy levels, rather than discrepancies in predictions.
Criticism:
  None.

  C: Walter Alvarez's discovery of iridium in rock core samples and subsequent discovery of an impact crater is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery of reversed magnetized rocks is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of an undetected particle is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers discovered Neptune by hypothesizing the existence of another planet when their predictions of Uranus' orbit were incorrect.
  Therefore, the most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune is one in which a hypothesis is used to explain observations that do not match predictions.
  Answer choice C involves a hypothesis being used to explain observations, but it is not about a failed prediction.
  Answer choice E involves a hypothesis being used to explain observations, but it is not about a failed prediction.
  Answer choice A is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Answer choice B is not about a failed prediction.
  Answer choice D is not about a failed prediction, but it does involve a hypothesis being used to explain observations.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers discovered the planet Neptune by making predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. They found that their prediction for the orbit of Uranus was incorrect, and concluded that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. They later discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides did not involve making predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, and it did not involve discovering a new phenomenon or object to explain a discrepancy between prediction and observation.
  B: Edwin Hubble's discovery did not involve making predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, and it did not involve discovering a new phenomenon or object to explain a discrepancy between prediction and observation.
  C: Walter Alvarez's postulation did not involve making predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, and it did not involve discovering a new phenomenon or object to explain a discrepancy between prediction and observation.
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery did not involve making predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, and it did not involve discovering a new phenomenon or object to explain a discrepancy between prediction and observation.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli's postulation did not involve making predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, and it did not involve discovering a new phenomenon or object to explain a discrepancy between prediction and observation.
Thought: 
  The episode in Passage B involves making predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, and discovering a new object (Neptune) to explain a discrepancy between prediction and observation.
  None of the other episodes involve all of these elements.
  Therefore, none of the other episodes are analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  None of the above.
Criticism: 
  The answer is not "none of the above." 
  The reasoning is correct that none of the other episodes involve all of the elements of making predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, and discovering a new object to explain a discrepancy between prediction and observation.
  However, the question asks for the episode that is most analogous, not the episode that is identical, to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  The closest analogy to the discovery of Neptune is Walter Alvarez's postulation, which involves making a prediction based on observations of iridium levels in rock core samples, and later discovering evidence of a large impact crater that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction. Like the astronomers in Passage B, Alvarez made a prediction based on available evidence, and later found evidence to support that prediction.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes how astronomers discovered Neptune by hypothesizing the existence of another planet to explain the incorrect predictions of Uranus's orbit.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides incorrectly predicted the frequency of high tides, but this does not involve the discovery of a new planet.
  B: Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a separate galaxy does not involve the discovery of a new planet.
  C: Walter Alvarez's postulation of an asteroid impact to explain dinosaur extinction does not involve the discovery of a new planet.
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery of reversed magnetization in rocks does not involve the discovery of a new planet.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of a third particle to explain conservation of energy does not involve the discovery of a new planet.
Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers discovered Neptune by hypothesizing the existence of another planet to explain the incorrect predictions of Uranus's orbit.
  The discovery of Neptune was a result of a failed prediction of Uranus's orbit.
  Similarly, the discovery of a new planet was hypothesized to explain the incorrect prediction.
  Therefore, the scientific episode most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is A: Galileo's theory of tides, which also involved a failed prediction that required a new explanation.
Criticism:
  The analogy between the discovery of Neptune and Galileo's theory of tides is not strong.
  While both involved failed predictions, the discovery of Neptune was a result of hypothesizing the existence of another planet, whereas Galileo's theory of tides did not involve the discovery of a new planet.
  A better analogy would be the discovery of Vulcan, which was hypothesized to explain the incorrect prediction of Mercury's orbit, but was later found not to exist.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. When observations did not match predictions, the astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they called Neptune. Later, Neptune was discovered in the exact location needed to bring the calculations in line with observations.
  A: Galileo proposed a theory of tides that was contradicted by the observation that there are two high tides per day. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  B: Edwin Hubble used observations of variable stars to discover that Andromeda is a galaxy, not a nebula. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  C: Walter Alvarez hypothesized that an asteroid impact killed the dinosaurs based on the discovery of high levels of iridium in rock core samples. Later, evidence of a large impact crater was discovered. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of Earth's present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed in the past. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third undetected particle to explain apparent inconsistencies in energy conservation during neutron decay. Later, the particle was discovered. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
Thought: 
  In the discovery of Neptune, astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. When observations did not match predictions, the astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they called Neptune. Later, Neptune was discovered in the exact location needed to bring the calculations in line with observations. 
  The most analogous scientific episode is the one where scientists make a prediction based on a theory and auxiliary assumptions, and later discover evidence that supports the auxiliary assumptions and confirms the prediction. 
  The discovery of a third undetected particle to explain apparent inconsistencies in energy conservation during neutron decay comes closest to this, but it is not an exact match.
  Option B, where Edwin Hubble used observations of variable stars to discover that Andromeda is a galaxy, not a nebula, is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option C, where Walter Alvarez hypothesized that an asteroid impact killed the dinosaurs based on the discovery of high levels of iridium in rock core samples and later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered, is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option D, where Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of Earth's present-day magnetic field and concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed in the past, is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option E, where Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third undetected particle to explain apparent inconsistencies in energy conservation during neutron decay, is not an exact match, but it is the closest analogy.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between the discovery of Neptune and the discovery of a third undetected particle to explain apparent inconsistencies in energy conservation during neutron decay is not perfect because they are different in some important respects. 
  However, this is the best analogy among the options provided.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of the planet Neptune by astronomers who were attempting to predict Uranus's orbit using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right by observing variable stars and settling the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is created during the decay of a neutron into a proton and an electron, which was later confirmed.
Thought: 
  In Passage B, astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict Uranus's orbit, but the prediction was incorrect. 
  One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions.
  They changed their assumptions and hypothesized the existence of another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Later, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the discovery of the planet Neptune itself.
  The answer is none of the above.
Criticism: 
  The question asks for the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  None of the options describe a scientific episode that is analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  The discovery of Neptune involved astronomers using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict Uranus's orbit, but the prediction was incorrect.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.

The author argues that for public-policy purposes, a risk should not be deemed voluntarily incurred or involuntarily incurred based solely on whether people are subject to that risk only if they make a particular choice. 
E: The author briefly mentions that an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid is an example of a risk that is completely involuntary. The author does not explicitly state that the main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster. 
Thought: 
The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention and are of little utility in guiding policy decisions. The author also argues that for public-policy purposes, a risk should not be deemed voluntarily incurred or involuntarily incurred based solely on whether people are subject to that risk only if they make a particular choice. 
A: The author does not explicitly state whether people should or should not be protected against risks incurred through dangerous activities, such as skydiving. 
B: The author does not explicitly state whether the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would be deemed irrelevant by policy experts. 
C: The passage does not provide information to support or refute the statement that the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers. 
D: The author argues that for public-policy purposes, a risk should not be deemed voluntarily incurred or involuntarily incurred based solely on whether people are subject to that risk only if they make a particular choice. The author also discusses how determining whether a risk is voluntarily incurred is not easy. 
E: The author briefly mentions that an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid is an example of a risk that is completely involuntary. The author does not explicitly state that the main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster. 
The statement that most closely aligns with the author's argument is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. Answer("D")

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: According to the passage, why do university researchers increasingly believe that patents should be granted for commercially promising biotechnology discoveries?
Choices:
  A: Researchers' prospects for academic advancement depend on both the quality and the quantity of their research.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

  CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how CFCs contribute to ozone depletion.
  Chlorine is released into the stratosphere when CFCs break down, and this chlorine destroys ozone and regenerates itself.
  Therefore, little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  The passage mentions the link between ultraviolet light and skin cancer, but it does not support the claim that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.

  Ozone is a toxic form of oxygen that screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere.
  In the 1970s, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
Thought: 
  The passage describes how CFCs attack and deplete the ozone layer causing a reduction in its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The reduction in the ozone layer leads to an increase in skin cancer since it no longer protects against ultraviolet radiation.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  The most strongly supported statement is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Criticism: 
  None.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The primary function of the third paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: reject a possible response to the argument made in the first paragraph
  B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph
  C: present an argument that weakens the argument made in the second paragraph
  D: offer additional evidence for the conclusion reach,ed in the second paragraph
  E: draw a definitive conclusion from the claims made in the second paragraph
Response 0:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. The paragraph discusses the need for the elite to have a recognizable identity and the possibility of artists subverting the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. The paragraph also highlights that historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class. Therefore, the third paragraph aims to clarify the assumptions necessary for the sociohistorical analysis of the type described in the first paragraph to work. The correct answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The third paragraph discusses the limitations of the sociohistorical analysis of art produced by the elite.
  The analysis assumes that the elite had a recognizable identity and consensus about the world.
  Historically, the aristocracy and the well-to-do middle class were the two social classes able to commission art.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses the limitations of the sociohistorical analysis of art produced by the elite.
  It notes that for the analysis to work, the elite must have a recognizable identity and consensus about the world.
  However, the taste of the elite has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
  Therefore, it is difficult to assume that all art produced by the elite embodied their ideals.
  The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
  The answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Criticism:
  Your analysis is correct and the answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Therefore, the answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The third paragraph follows the second paragraph and precedes the fourth paragraph.
  The third paragraph discusses the taste and values of the aristocracy and the middle class in relation to the art they commissioned.
  The third paragraph also mentions that some artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment and that some art that went against the grain of elite values endured.
Thought:
  The third paragraph provides additional information about the type of art produced by the aristocracy and the middle class that was mentioned in the second paragraph.
  The third paragraph also suggests that some art that went against elite values endured, which may challenge the argument made in the second paragraph that "high art" embodied the ideology of the elite.
  Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
  The assumptions identified are that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and that artists did not subvert the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.
  By discussing the taste and values of the aristocracy and the middle class, the third paragraph highlights that the assumptions may not always hold.
  The paragraph does not reject a possible response to the argument made in the first paragraph, present an argument that weakens the argument made in the second paragraph, offer additional evidence for the conclusion reached in the second paragraph, or draw a definitive conclusion from the claims made in the second paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The third paragraph discusses the limitations of analyzing art produced by elites and the social classes that were able to commission art historically.
Thought: 
  The paragraph presents an argument that weakens the argument made in the second paragraph. The second paragraph argues that sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze art produced by elites because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of how such art embodied the ideology of the elite. However, the third paragraph argues that the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures and that a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Therefore, it weakens the argument made in the second paragraph by suggesting that art produced by elites may not always reflect their true ideals and values. 
  The answer is C: present an argument that weakens the argument made in the second paragraph.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the paragraph that the argument made in the first paragraph is being rejected, nor is there any definitive conclusion being drawn from the claims made in the second paragraph. Therefore, options A, D, and E are incorrect.
  Option B is close but not entirely accurate, as the paragraph does not specifically identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph, but rather discusses the limitations and challenges of analyzing art produced by elites.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Therefore, the answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Response 6:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. 
Therefore, the answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Response 7:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Therefore, the answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The third paragraph discusses the historical reality of art commissioned by the aristocracy and the middle class.
Thought:
  The third paragraph does not reject a possible response to the argument made in the first paragraph.
  The third paragraph does identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
  The third paragraph does not present an argument that weakens the argument made in the second paragraph.
  The third paragraph does not offer additional evidence for the conclusion reached in the second paragraph.
  The third paragraph does not draw a definitive conclusion from the claims made in the second paragraph.
  Therefore, the answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Criticism:
  This is the correct interpretation of the third paragraph. 
  The paragraph explains the assumptions that must be made for sociohistorical analysis to work, particularly the need for a recognizable identity and consensus among the elite. 
  This understanding is necessary for the reader to follow the argument of the passage as a whole.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. Therefore, the answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements
  B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines
  C: a hypothetical situation supporting a statement reported by the author in the earlier lines
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients and to the court/society.
  The author discusses the obligation of lawyers to not present assertions they know to be false.
  The author argues that lawyers should not present false representations for guilty defendants but should instead appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor and present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.
Thought: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 discuss the obligation of lawyers to not present false assertions for guilty defendants.
  This obligation is related to the author's argument that the lawyers' obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court/society.
  The author argues that lawyers have a responsibility to present their clients' cases as much as possible in their clients' favor and to present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.
  If the client is guilty, lawyers should not present false representations.
  Therefore, the information in the sentences at lines 28-31 supports and is related to the author's argument in the earlier lines.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the role and obligations of defense lawyers.
- The first paragraph reports on the view of some legal scholars who believe that lawyers have no right to judge defendants and should provide the best defense they are capable of.
- The second paragraph argues that defense lawyers have an obligation not only to their clients but also to the court and society, and that they should not present assertions they know to be false.
Thought:
- The sentence at lines 7-11 reports on the view of some legal scholars that defense lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, without expressing or acting on personal opinions.
- The sentence at lines 28-31 argues that lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence, but should instead present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency they sincerely believe is warranted.
- These two sentences are related because they both discuss the obligations of defense lawyers, particularly in cases where they believe their clients are guilty.
- However, they do not represent agreement or disagreement over the same position, but rather address different aspects of the lawyer's obligations.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients, the court and society.
  Some legal scholars believe that lawyers have an obligation to provide the best defense they are capable of without judging the defendant's guilt or innocence.
  The obligation of the defense lawyer is twofold: to the defendant and to the court/society.
Thought: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 state that a lawyer should appraise the case in their client's favor and present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted when they know with certainty that the defendant is guilty.
  This idea extends the earlier position that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court/society.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 provide details on how a defense lawyer should fulfill their obligation to the court/society when they know their client is guilty.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 and that in the sentence at lines 7-11 is that the former elaborates on how the defense lawyer's obligation to the court/society should be fulfilled, which is stated earlier in the passage.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism: N/A
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients, the court, and society.
  The passage argues that a defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court/society.
  The passage argues that a defense lawyer should not present assertions that they know to be false and should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence if they are convinced that their client is guilty.
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that lawyers should not deny the guilt of their clients, but rather present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.
  This statement supports the argument made in the earlier lines (7-11) that a defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court/society.
  The statement at lines 28-31 provides a specific example of how a defense lawyer can fulfill their obligation to the court/society while still providing the best defense possible for their client.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information contained in the two sentences is that the statement at lines 28-31 supports and provides a specific example of the argument made in the sentence at lines 7-11.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism: 
  None.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients, the court, and society.
  Legal scholars argue that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, and they have no right to judge defendants.
  The lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate.
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 7-11 discusses the position of some legal scholars that defense lawyers have no right to judge defendants and should only provide the best possible legal representation.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 discuss the obligation of lawyers to their clients, the court, and society, and argue that lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their clients' innocence if they are convinced that their clients are guilty.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 expand on the position in the earlier lines by explaining that lawyers have a twofold obligation to their clients and society, and that their role is to act as advocates for their clients while also being officers of the court.
  The position in both sets of sentences is that lawyers have an obligation to provide the best defense they can while also fulfilling their obligations to the court and society.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information in the two sets of sentences is that they are essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism: N/A
Action: Answer("E")

  The passage argues that defense lawyers should not present assertions that they know to be false and that they should not undertake to demonstrate the innocence of clients whom they know with certainty are guilty.
  The passage also argues that defense lawyers should appraise the case in their clients' favor and argue for leniency in sentencing where warranted.
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate the innocence of clients whom they know with certainty are guilty.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 argues that some legal scholars hold that it is not necessary for defense lawyers to believe that their clients are innocent. 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 contradicts the position of those legal scholars, as it argues that lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate the innocence of clients whom they know with certainty are guilty.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is that the sentence at lines 28-31 opposes the position reported by the author in the earlier lines.
  The answer is B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct. 
  There is no significant flaw in your logic.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses whether defense lawyers need to believe their clients are innocent of the charges against them.
  Legal scholars argue that lawyers are obligated to provide the best defense they can and not judge defendants.
  The obligation of a defense lawyer is twofold: to the defendant and to the court/society.
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that lawyers who are convinced their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Instead, they should present any extenuating circumstances and argue for leniency in sentencing. 
  This sentence expresses the author's opinion on how defense lawyers should handle cases where they know their clients are guilty.
  The earlier lines discuss legal scholars' opinions on the obligations of defense lawyers to their clients and the courts.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 is an extension of the author's argument and is not a hypothetical situation or unrelated factual statement.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is that the author is expressing their opinion in response to the opinions of legal scholars.
  The answer is B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines.
Criticism: N/A
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the role of defense lawyers and whether they need to believe their clients are innocent.
  Some legal scholars believe lawyers have no right to judge defendants and must provide the best defense possible.
  Other scholars believe lawyers have a twofold obligation to their clients and society.
Thought:
  The information in lines 28-31 refers to the lawyer's obligation to assess the facts of the case and present extenuating circumstances and leniency in sentencing if the defendant is guilty.
  The information in lines 7-11 discusses the obligation of lawyers to provide the best defense they are capable of and not to judge defendants.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 provides a specific example of how lawyers should approach their obligation to society and the court when they are convinced their client is guilty.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences is that they provide specific guidelines for how lawyers should approach their obligation to society and the court when their client is guilty, which expands upon the general obligation of lawyers to provide the best defense possible and not judge defendants.
  The answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Criticism: 
  The information in lines 28-31 does not necessarily disagree with the information in lines 7-11. 
  Rather, it provides a specific example of how lawyers should approach their obligation to society and the court when their client is guilty.
  Therefore, the answer could also be E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients, the court, and society.
  Some legal scholars believe that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, without expressing personal opinions or beliefs about their clients' guilt or innocence.
  Other scholars argue that lawyers also have an obligation to the court and society, and should not present false or insincere representations.
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that lawyers who know their clients are guilty should not try to demonstrate their innocence.
  This supports the argument that lawyers have an obligation to the court and society, and should not present false or insincere representations.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 discusses the argument that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, without expressing personal opinions or beliefs about their clients' guilt or innocence.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 contradicts this argument by stating that lawyers should not try to demonstrate their clients' innocence if they know they are guilty.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is one of disagreement.
  The answer is D: disagreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Criticism: 
  The answer is incorrect.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 does not necessarily contradict the argument that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, without expressing personal opinions or beliefs about their clients' guilt or innocence.
  The sentence simply states that lawyers who know their clients are guilty should not try to demonstrate their innocence.
  This does not necessarily mean that lawyers should express personal opinions or beliefs about their clients' guilt or innocence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients, the court, and society.
  Some scholars believe that lawyers should provide the best defense possible without judging their clients.
  The author argues that lawyers have an obligation to the court and society, and should not present false assertions.
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that defense lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their guilty clients' innocence.
  This position is consistent with the author's argument that lawyers have an obligation to the court and society, and should not present false assertions.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 reports the opinion of some scholars that lawyers should provide the best defense possible without judging their clients.
  While the two sentences are not directly related, the sentence at lines 28-31 can be seen as evidence supporting the author's argument against the position of the scholars.
  Thus, the relationship between the two sets of sentences is that they represent different perspectives on the obligation of defense lawyers.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: In what other areas besides Europe did Spanish-language proverbs currently used in Mexican American communities originate?
  B: Are any proverbs that are used frequently in the English-language tradition derived from Mexican American proverbs?

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: The author of the passage refers to "self, life, and writing" (lines 12–13) most probably in order to
Choices:
  A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas

  You are correct in your analysis. The passage describes how the ideas about self, life, and writing were different in early Native American cultures compared to European cultures. 
  Therefore, the answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how Native American modes of communicating personal history differ from European-style autobiography and how traditional modes of autobiography differ from the European-style autobiography.
Thought: 
  The author refers to "self, life, and writing" to illustrate the concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas. The author argues that the idea of self was markedly inclusive in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, identity was not merely individual but also relational to society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events and the mode of autobiography was seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Therefore, the author is showing how the ideas about self, life, and writing were different in the Native American culture compared to the European culture.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how scholars studying Native American autobiographies have overlooked traditional modes of communicating personal history, which were preliterate and focused on current events and oral expression.
  The passage notes that pre-contact Native American cultures had different assumptions about self, life, and writing than Europeans did, and that the idea of self was more inclusive and relational to a society, landscape, and cosmos.
Thought: 
  The author refers to "self, life, and writing" to highlight the differences between European and Native American cultures and concepts. The passage notes that Native American cultures did not share the same assumptions about self and life as Europeans, and therefore their modes of communicating personal history were different from European-style autobiography. The author also notes that the English word "autobiography" has roots in assumptions about self, life, and writing that do not necessarily apply to pre-contact Native American cultures.
  Therefore, the answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the differences between European and Native American concepts of autobiography.
Thought: 
  The author refers to "self, life, and writing" in order to illustrate how these concepts had different meanings for Europeans and Native Americans. The passage explains that Native American cultures had a more inclusive concept of self and that traditional modes of expressing life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events. In contrast, European-style autobiography emphasizes the individual and focuses on the recollections of a lifetime.
  Therefore, the answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that the author is defining a word that had a different meaning for early Native Americans than it has for contemporary Native Americans, illustrating how words can undergo a change in meaning after their introduction into the language, positing a fundamental similarity in the origins of a concept in both European and Native American cultures, or explaining how the assumptions that underlie European-style autobiography arose. 
  However, it is clear that the author is discussing the differences between European and Native American concepts of autobiography, and uses the phrases "self, life, and writing" to illustrate these differences.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the differences between traditional Native American modes of communicating personal history and European-style autobiography.
  The author mentions "self, life, and writing" in the context of discussing the different assumptions that underlie the concept of an autobiography in European and Native American cultures.
Thought:
  The author mentions "self, life, and writing" to highlight the fact that the underlying assumptions of these concepts in European and Native American cultures were different.
  European-style autobiographies were based on individualism, where an individual's life experiences were recorded in writing.
  Native American cultures, on the other hand, had a more inclusive idea of self that was relational to society, landscape, and cosmos, and personal history was communicated through various modes such as speech, signs, songs, dances, and artifacts.
  Therefore, the author is most likely identifying concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
  The answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the author is defining a word or illustrating how words can change in meaning.
  The passage does not suggest a fundamental similarity in the origins of a concept in both European and Native American cultures.
  The author is not explaining how the assumptions that underlie European-style autobiography arose; rather, the author is discussing the differences between traditional Native American modes of communicating personal history and European-style autobiography.
Action: Answer("A")

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception
  D: questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence
  E: countering a revolutionary hypothesis

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity.
  The scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The scans represent the differential rate of oxygen use by subtracting a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement.
Thought:
  The FMRI scans are interpreted based on a subtraction method.
  The subtraction method produces an image that represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, an analogous scenario would be one in which a particular part of a whole is emphasized or given special attention while the rest of the whole is ignored or downplayed.
  The scenario in which much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur is the most analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the limitations of interpreting FMRI brain scans as a way to identify localized brain regions associated with specific cognitive functions. 
  The FMRI scan is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The method used to interpret FMRI scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement in the control condition from a second measurement taken while the subject is performing some cognitive task. 
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted based on a subtraction method that involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing some cognitive task. 
  This method is analogous to subtracting the amount of water used by residential customers from the total amount of water used to determine how much water is used by agricultural customers. 
  Just as the subtraction method used in FMRI scans can obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, subtracting the amount of water used by residential customers can obscure the fact that residential customers also use some of the water that is designated for agricultural customers.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
Criticism: 
  None.

Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging, specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), to study mental activity.
  FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The FMRI method involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during a cognitive task to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with that task.
Thought:
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during a cognitive task.
  The difference between the two measurements is assumed to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  Therefore, interpreting FMRI scans in this way obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  This method produces striking images of the brain at work but gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The method is analogous to another scenario in which a difference between two measurements is assumed to represent the impact of a certain factor.
  Choice A is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice B is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice C is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice D is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice E is analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans because both involve a difference between two measurements that is assumed to represent the impact of a certain factor.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The article is discussing the use of neuroimaging in psychology and the modular theory of mind.
  FMRI scans are used to measure metabolic activity in different parts of the brain while a subject performs a cognitive task.
  The FMRI scan is actually a result of a subtraction - a baseline measurement is taken and subtracted from the on-task measurement to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, yet it produces striking images of the brain at work.
  An analogy to this situation would be one where a subset of a larger group is isolated in order to measure the effect of a particular variable.
  Choice A provides an analogy where a particular district in a city is isolated in order to measure the effect of its vote on the outcome of an election.
  Choice B provides an analogy where a store's advertising campaign is isolated in order to measure the effect of its advertisements on summer shoppers.
  Choice C provides an analogy where the agricultural sector is isolated in order to measure the impact of droughts on water usage.
  Choice D provides an analogy where home Internet usage is isolated in order to measure peak-hour Internet traffic.
  Choice E provides an analogy where cheetahs are isolated in order to measure their speed over long distances.
  The best analogy is choice B because it isolates a subset (summer shoppers) in order to measure the effect of a particular variable (the store's advertising campaign).
Criticism: 
  The analogy in choice B is not a perfect match for the situation described in the article, as it does not involve a subtraction or the isolation of a particular variable in the same way as FMRI scans.
  However, it is the closest match among the choices provided.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) as a research method in psychology to identify localized brain regions associated with different mental processes.
  FMRI produces a map of the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain, which is interpreted as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The method involves subtracting a baseline measurement of brain activity in a control condition from a measurement during a cognitive task, to isolate the activity associated solely with the task.
Thought:
  The question asks for an analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  The interpretation of FMRI involves subtracting a baseline measurement of brain activity from a measurement during a cognitive task, to isolate the activity associated solely with the task.
  A: This analogy does not fit because it involves a situation where one district's votes were essential for a candidate to win, whereas the interpretation of FMRI involves subtracting a baseline measurement to isolate activity associated with a specific task.
  B: This analogy does not fit because it involves a situation where an advertising campaign only affected shoppers during a certain time period, whereas the interpretation of FMRI involves isolating brain activity associated with a specific cognitive task.
  C: This analogy does not fit because it involves a situation where water usage is higher for one customer group than another, whereas the interpretation of FMRI involves isolating brain activity associated with a specific cognitive task.
  D: This analogy does not fit because it involves a situation where Internet traffic is higher during certain hours and originates from one location rather than another, whereas the interpretation of FMRI involves isolating brain activity associated with a specific cognitive task.
  E: This analogy fits because it involves a situation where cheetahs are the fastest land animal only for short distances, whereas most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances. Similarly, the interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement to isolate brain activity associated with a specific cognitive task, rather than assuming that different mental processes are localized in distinct brain regions.
Criticism: 
  The analogy is not perfect, since it does not directly involve subtraction or isolation as the interpretation of FMRI does. However, it still captures the idea that the interpretation of FMRI scans may not accurately reflect the activity of distinct brain regions associated with specific mental processes.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  The FMRI scan is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI scan actually depicts the differential rate of oxygen use between a baseline measurement in the control condition and a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
Thought:
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting the baseline measurement from the measurement during the cognitive task, which produces images of the brain at work.
  This subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and it gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The question asks for an analogy to the manner in which FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Choice A discusses the importance of one particular district in a city's mayoral election, which is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice B discusses the effect of a store's advertising campaign on summer shoppers, which is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice C discusses the impact of droughts on different types of water customers, which is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice D discusses the origin of Internet traffic during peak hours, which is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice E discusses the limitations of the cheetah's speed over long distances, which is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  None of the choices are directly related to the interpretation of FMRI scans, so we need to try to find the closest analogy.
  The interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement during a cognitive task to measure metabolic activity.
  Choice B involves subtracting the number of shoppers during a non-promotional period from the number of shoppers during a promotional period to measure the impact of an advertising campaign.
  This is the closest analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  FMRI scans are used to measure metabolic activity in different parts of the brain.
  The scans produce images that show differences in metabolic activity between a control condition and a cognitive task.
  The resulting images are interpreted as maps of localized brain activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans produce images that show differences in metabolic activity between a control condition and a cognitive task.
  The resulting images are interpreted as maps of localized brain activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  However, the method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the way FMRI scans are typically interpreted is analogous to option B, where the advertisements are assumed to have affected only the summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and the modular theory of mind.
  FMRI scans are used to measure metabolic activity in different parts of the brain.
  The scans are interpreted by taking a baseline measurement and subtracting it from a measurement taken while a subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The remaining differential is assumed to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  The scans are interpreted by taking a baseline measurement and subtracting it from a measurement taken while a subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The remaining differential is assumed to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, not just the area of interest.
  Therefore, the method is most similar to the way in which option B is interpreted.
  In option B, an increase in shoppers during the summer is assumed to be due to the yearlong advertising campaign, even though the increase may have been caused by other factors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans to measure brain activity in response to cognitive tasks.
  FMRI scans measure the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, and this subtraction method is used to isolate the metabolic activity associated with a cognitive task.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted using a subtraction method to isolate the metabolic activity associated with a cognitive task.
  This method is analogous to which of the following scenarios?
  A: This scenario is not analogous to the use of FMRI scans.
  B: This scenario is not analogous to the use of FMRI scans.
  C: This scenario is not analogous to the use of FMRI scans.
  D: This scenario is not analogous to the use of FMRI scans.
  E: This scenario is analogous to the use of FMRI scans. The cheetah is the fastest land animal only for short distances, and most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances. Similarly, FMRI scans use a subtraction method to isolate the metabolic activity associated with a cognitive task, but this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. The cheetah's speed is analogous to the isolated metabolic activity associated with a cognitive task, and the fact that most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances is analogous to the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Criticism: 
  This analogy is not perfect, as the cheetah example involves physical limitations while the FMRI example involves methodological limitations. However, it is still the most analogous choice among the options provided.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology as a research method.
  FMRI is a type of brain scan that measures the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI method subtracts a baseline measurement in the control condition from a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  The reasoning is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought: 
  The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The interpretation is based on the subtraction of a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during some cognitive task.
  The reasoning is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  It gives a false impression of neat functional localization by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions.
  So, the question asks us for an analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  A, B, C, and D are all analogies, but only one of them is most similar to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  A is about a particular district in a city affecting an election.
  B is about a store's advertising campaign affecting only summer shoppers.
  C is about droughts impacting agricultural customers more than residential customers.
  D is about Internet traffic being highest during evening hours originating in homes rather than office buildings.
  None of these analogies are particularly close to the interpretation of FMRI, which involves subtracting out a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during some cognitive task.
  So, none of these is the correct answer.
  E is about cheetahs being the fastest land animal only for short distances.
  This is not very similar to FMRI scans, but it does involve a similar idea of a particular ability being limited to specific conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Criticism: 
  The analogy in E is not very strong since it only involves a similar idea of a particular ability being limited to specific conditions.
  However, it is the closest analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans among the given choices.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins
  B: endorse a claim simply because it is widely believed
  C: accept a claim for the sake of argument
  D: attempt to resolve an apparent paradox
  E: assert that their positions are supported by data

  Both authors use evidence and data to support their arguments.
  Both authors attempt to resolve an apparent paradox.
  Therefore, the answer is D: attempt to resolve an apparent paradox.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A discusses research on the relationship between wealth and happiness, and how people compare their income with some norm. The passage B argues that the desire to create value, rather than one-upmanship, is what motivates people to earn more and be happy.
Thought: 
  The authors of both passages are arguing for their respective positions.
  The author of passage A points out the paradox between higher levels of happiness reported by richer people and the fact that advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. They explain the phenomenon by pointing out two phenomena: habituation and rivalry. They support their claims with evidence from research studies and observations.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials
  C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Passage B differs from passage A in that analogous displays an attitude toward the ideas it discusses that is more
Choices:
  A: engaged
  B: dismissive
  C: detached
  D: ironic
  E: skeptical
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience change the way we should think about the law and suggests that retribution should be abandoned in favor of deterrence.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and how it can coexist with determinism, using the theory of soft determinism put forth by Ayer.
Thought:
  Passage A discusses the implications of recent findings in neuroscience for the law, suggesting a major change in how we should think about punishment.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and presents a theory for how it can coexist with determinism.
  Neither passage explicitly criticizes or dismisses the other, but instead presents different ideas related to the law and neuroscience.
  Therefore, the attitude in Passage B is more detached than Passage A.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that the operations of the brain cause behavior and that neuroscience changes the way we think about the law. It suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harm instead of retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will coexisting with determinism, arguing for "soft determinism" that distinguishes between free and constrained actions based on internal and external sources.
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B discuss different topics, with A focusing on how neuroscience changes the way we think about the law, and B focusing on the concept of free will coexisting with determinism.
  Passage B does not appear to display an attitude that is dismissive, detached, ironic, or skeptical. The passage presents an argument for "soft determinism" and distinguishes between free and constrained actions.
  Therefore, the answer is A: engaged.
Criticism:
  There is no criticism to be made. The analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes recent findings in neuroscience that suggest that all behavior is caused by the brain and that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harm instead of punishing for retribution. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in deterministic world, and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B both talk about the relationship between the brain and behavior, but they approach the topic from different angles. 
  Passage A suggests that behavior is entirely caused by the brain and implies that the traditional justification for punishment (retribution) is outdated. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and argues that even in a deterministic world, actions can still be considered free as long as they are not constrained. 
  Passage B does not explicitly engage with the ideas presented in Passage A, but instead presents a different viewpoint on the topic of free will.
  Therefore, Passage B is more detached towards the ideas presented in Passage A.
  The answer is C: detached.
Criticism: 
  There are elements of skepticism in both passages, as both challenge traditional assumptions about the relationship between behavior and free will. 
  However, Passage B argues for the coexistence of determinism and free will, which is a different argument than the one presented in Passage A. 
  Therefore, it is still accurate to say that Passage B is more detached towards the ideas presented in Passage A, but skepticism is also a valid interpretation.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the implications of recent neuroscience findings for the law.
  Passage A argues that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  Passage A suggests that people may not be making free and rational moral choices.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world.
  Passage B proposes a theory of "soft determinism" and distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
Thought: 
  Passage A is focused on the implications of neuroscience findings for the law and proposes a new approach to punishment.
  Passage B is discussing a philosophical concept and proposes a theory to reconcile determinism with the concept of free will.
  The tone of Passage A is more practical and policy-oriented, while the tone of Passage B is more theoretical and conceptual.
  The attitude of Passage B toward the ideas it discusses is more engaged and thoughtful, while the attitude of Passage A is more detached and analytical.
  Therefore, the answer is A: engaged.
Criticism: 
  The answer is incorrect. 
  While it is true that Passage B is more theoretical and conceptual, it is not necessarily true that the attitude of Passage B toward the ideas it discusses is more engaged and thoughtful than the attitude of Passage A. 
  Both passages discuss complex and important ideas and make thoughtful arguments.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that neuroscience has radically changed the way we think about the law and suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution in favor of focusing on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world and introduces the idea of "soft determinism" where actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought:
  Passage A focuses on the idea that neuroscience has changed how we think about the law and suggests a new approach to punishment.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and introduces the idea of "soft determinism".
  While Passage A takes a specific stance on the issue, Passage B presents a theory without taking a clear position.
  Therefore, the attitude in Passage B is more detached than Passage A.
  The answer is C: detached.
Criticism:
  The analysis and conclusion are accurate.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the implications of neuroscience on the law, arguing that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterrence rather than retribution.
  Passage B discusses the relationship between free will and determinism, and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss different topics and have different arguments.
  Passage A focuses on the implications of neuroscience on the law, and argues that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterrence rather than retribution.
  Passage B focuses on the relationship between free will and determinism, and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Neither passage displays an attitude toward the ideas it discusses that is more engaged, dismissive, detached, ironic, or skeptical.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the implications of neuroscience for the law, and suggests that the idea of retribution should be abandoned in favor of deterrence.
  Passage B discusses the relationship between free will and determinism, and presents Ayer's theory of "soft determinism."
Thought: 
  Passage A takes a specific position on the issue it discusses, arguing that the criminal justice system should abandon retribution and focus on deterrence instead. 
  Passage B, on the other hand, presents Ayer's theory of soft determinism and does not take a clear position on the issue of free will and determinism.
  Therefore, the attitude displayed in Passage B is more detached than that displayed in Passage A.
  The answer is C: detached.
Criticism: 
  It is possible to argue that Passage B does take a position on the issue it discusses, namely that actions can be free even in a deterministic world.
  However, the passage does not explicitly argue for this position or engage with alternative views in the way that Passage A does.
  Therefore, the answer C: detached is still the most appropriate.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how recent findings in neuroscience change the way we think about the law. It suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of punishing bad people. 
  Passage B discusses how the concept of free will can coexist with determinism. It argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of punishing bad people based on recent findings in neuroscience. 
  Passage B discusses how the concept of free will can coexist with determinism. 
  Neither passage displays an attitude towards the ideas it discusses.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses how recent findings in neuroscience affect the way we think about law. It suggests that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing people for their immoral acts.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and how it can coexist with determinism. It argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B present different ideas and arguments.
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms, while Passage B discusses the concept of free will and how it can coexist with determinism.
  Since Passage B is not directly discussing the ideas presented in Passage A, it is unlikely that it would be dismissive or ironic. 
  However, Passage B does present a different view on free will that is not discussed in Passage A, so it may be more skeptical or detached than Passage A.
  Therefore, the answer is E: skeptical.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct, as Passage B does present a different view on free will that is not discussed in Passage A, but it is not clear whether Passage B is more skeptical or detached than Passage A. It is possible that the author of Passage B is engaged with the ideas, but in a different way than the author of Passage A.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses how recent neuroscience findings change the way we think about the law and suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism, and argues that actions can be free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought:
  Passage B discusses a philosophical concept of free will and determinism, which is different from the legal implications discussed in Passage A.
  The author of Passage B argues for the coexistence of free will and determinism and presents a theory of "soft determinism".
  The tone of Passage B is analytical and explanatory, without expressing any strong attitude towards the ideas discussed.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

Choices:
  A: respect

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal suggests that teaching about other cultures should be done from the perspective of the majority culture.
  The second proposal suggests that multicultural education should adopt a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that the methods of examination and study of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still Western.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second proposal is that the methods of examination and study of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still Western.
  Therefore, to provide the strongest objection to this criticism, we need a statement that shows that the methods of examination and study of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are not Western.
  Option A is irrelevant to the criticism and does not address the methods of examination and study of cultures.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the criticism, as similarity among non-Western societies does not address the issue of Western methods of examination and study.
  Option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, but it does not address the issue of Western methods of examination and study.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the criticism, as it discusses understanding Western achievements, not the examination and study of other cultures.
  Option E supports the criticism that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, but it does not address the issue of Western methods of examination and study.
  None of the options provide a statement that shows that the methods of examination and study of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are not Western.

  Critics of the second version argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
Thought: 
  The second version of multicultural education attempts to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are value-laden because they derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage, which prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  The strongest objection to this criticism would be that Western scientific methods are not value-laden and can be used to understand other cultures without distorting them.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument made in the passage and can be eliminated.
  Choice A does not refute the criticism because the objection is not about adopting the perspectives and methods of a culture, but about the value-laden nature of Western scientific methods.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument made in the passage and can be eliminated.
  Choice C does not refute the criticism because it simply states that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures, which is already assumed in the second version of multicultural education.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument made in the passage and can be eliminated.
  Therefore, none of the choices provide a strong objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.

  Critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that Western scientific methods are already value-laden and that understanding other cultures requires adopting their own perspectives and methods.
Thought:
  The question asks for the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  The criticism is that using Western scientific methods to examine and understand other cultures is not essentially different from using liberal values as standards.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to this criticism would be that using Western scientific methods to examine and understand other cultures is fundamentally different from using liberal values as standards.
  Choice D is not relevant to the discussion of multicultural education.
  Choices A and C are not objections to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Choice B weakens the criticism, but it is not the strongest objection.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The second version holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
  Critics argue that the Western scientific heritage and the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are value-laden and distort the understanding of non-Western cultures.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it relies on a Western scientific perspective that is not suited for understanding non-Western cultures.
  To provide the strongest objection to this criticism, we need to find an answer that shows that the Western scientific perspective is not the only perspective that can be used to understand non-Western cultures.
  Answer A is incorrect because the passage does not argue that it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  Answer B is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the similarities between non-Western societies.
  Answer C is possible, but it does not provide a strong objection to the criticism because it merely suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  Answer D is incorrect because it is not relevant to the discussion of multicultural education.
  Answer E is also possible, but it is not the strongest objection to the criticism because it does not address the issue of the Western scientific perspective.
Criticism: 
  Answer C is possible, but it does not provide the strongest objection to the criticism because it merely suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education. 
  The first proposal argues for teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture's methods, perspectives, and values.
  The second proposal argues for taking each culture on its own terms and adopting a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that adopting Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures is not a true understanding of those cultures.
Thought: 
  The strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would be a response to the argument that adopting Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures is not a true understanding of those cultures.
  Option A, which claims it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture, does not directly address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. 
  Option B, which states that many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another, is not relevant to the discussion of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option C, which claims that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, does not address the issue of adopting Western scientific methods for studying non-Western cultures.
  Option D, which argues that students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations, is not relevant to the discussion of multicultural education.
  Option E, which claims that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, does not directly address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education either.
  Therefore, none of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The second version of multicultural education holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that Western scientific methods are already value-laden.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that Western scientific methods are already value-laden, and that the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  The objection is that the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first, and that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective.
  To refute this objection, we need to show that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied can still lead to genuine understanding.
  Choice A is not relevant to the objection.
  Choice B is not relevant to the objection.
  Choice C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying other cultures, which may provide a counterexample to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. However, it is not clear whether this is enough to provide the strongest objection to the criticism.
  Choice D is not relevant to the objection.
  Choice E supports the idea that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, but it does not directly address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Criticism: 
  Choice C may not be enough to provide the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values (typically those of liberalism).
  The second version promotes multicultural understanding by adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still uses Western scientific methods.
  Critics of the second version argue that Western scientific methods are already value-laden and distort the understanding of non-Western cultures.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that Western scientific methods are already value-laden and cannot provide genuine understanding of non-Western cultures.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to this criticism would be if there is a way to use Western scientific methods without imposing Western values on non-Western cultures.
  Choice C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, which implies that Western scientific methods can be used in a way that does not impose Western values.
  Therefore, choice C provides the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:

  Critics argue that the second version is not essentially different from the first because Western scientific methods are value-laden and not appropriate for understanding non-Western cultures.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it still uses Western scientific methods, which are value-laden and not appropriate for understanding non-Western cultures.
  To provide a strong objection to this criticism, we need to show that the Western scientific methods are not value-laden or that they are appropriate for understanding non-Western cultures.
  Option A is not relevant to the criticism.
  Option B is not relevant to the criticism.
  Option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system for studying cultures, but it does not address the criticism of Western scientific methods being value-laden.
  Option D is not relevant to the topic of multicultural education.
  Option E is not a statement, but rather a fact that is already mentioned in the passage.
  None of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education. 
  The first version advocates for teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture, which values democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. 
  The second version advocates for taking each culture on its own terms, without judging it based on Western standards. 
  Critics of the second version argue that using Western methods to study non-Western cultures is distorting and Eurocentric.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is still Western-centric, as it uses Western methods to study non-Western cultures. 
  To provide a strong objection to this criticism, we need to show that it is possible to understand non-Western cultures using Western methods without distorting them. 
  Option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values. 
  If these societies are able to understand other cultures without compromising their own values, then it is possible for Western societies to do the same. 
  Therefore, option C provides the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the controversy surrounding the music of Arnold Schoenberg and how it altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. 
  Schoenberg precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
Thought: 
  Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths and precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Therefore, the answer would be something that similarly unflinchingly faces difficult truths and brings to light aspects of human nature that many people would prefer to ignore.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the music of Arnold Schoenberg and how it was initially controversial but eventually became recognized as essential for the way it recorded new emotional states.
Thought: 
  The passage doesn't give any specific examples of disturbing things that are analogous to Schoenberg's music, but it does suggest that the most important thing is what the music has to say. Therefore, the answer should be something that unflinchingly faces difficult truths and records new emotional states.
  A: This could be seen as disturbing, but it doesn't necessarily record new emotional states or face difficult truths.
  B: This seems like the best answer. It suggests that the comedian's humor is disturbing because it shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, which is similar to how Schoenberg's music records new emotional states.
  C: This could be seen as annoying or unoriginal, but it doesn't necessarily record new emotional states or face difficult truths.
  D: This could be seen as disturbing, but it doesn't necessarily record new emotional states or face difficult truths.
  E: This could be seen as disorienting, but it doesn't necessarily record new emotional states or face difficult truths.
Criticism: 
  The question asks for something that is disturbing in a way that is most analogous to Schoenberg's music, but the passage only discusses the specific ways in which Schoenberg's music is disturbing. The answer is therefore somewhat subjective.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:

  The question asks for something that is disturbing in a way that is most analogous to Schoenberg's music.
  Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. 
  Therefore, the answer choice that is most analogous to Schoenberg's music would be something that illuminates aspects of human nature that are difficult or uncomfortable to confront.
  Answer choice B, a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, is most analogous to Schoenberg's music.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Arnold Schoenberg's music and how it evolved through three different musical styles.

Thought: 
  The passage suggests that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that it unflinchingly faces difficult truths and precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Therefore, the answer choice that could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing would be one that also unflinchingly faces difficult truths or precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that people may not want to confront.
  Answer choice B, a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, fits this description the best.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the controversy surrounding the music of Arnold Schoenberg and Beethoven because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. 
  Schoenberg's music is described as disturbing because it "unflinchingly faces difficult truths" and "delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
Thought: 
  Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it confronts difficult truths and emotions that other music had not expressed before. 
  Therefore, a similar kind of disturbance could be found in someone whose work confronts difficult truths that people would prefer to ignore. 
  Option B, a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, is the most analogous to Schoenberg's music. 
  Options A, C, D, and E do not address the idea of confronting difficult truths or emotions in the same way that Schoenberg's music does. 
  The correct answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
  A: A comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor might be considered crass or distasteful, but this is not necessarily disturbing in the way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  B: A comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore might be considered thought-provoking or unsettling, which is similar to how Schoenberg's music can be disturbing.
  C: A comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians is not necessarily disturbing in the way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  D: A comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy might be considered controversial, but this is not necessarily disturbing in the way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  E: A comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience might be considered confusing or alienating, but this is not necessarily disturbing in the way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
Thought: 
  The passage states that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
  Of the answer choices, the one that is most analogous to this would be a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
  This is because both Schoenberg's music and this type of comedy are said to be disturbing because they tackle difficult or uncomfortable subjects that have not been previously explored.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Criticism: 
  The answer choice B is a plausible answer, but it is not the only possible answer.
  The passage does not explicitly state that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it addresses difficult or uncomfortable subjects; rather, it is because it "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
  Therefore, another answer choice that emphasizes the emotional or psychological impact of a work of art could also be considered a valid answer.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.
  D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  E: "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed someone not from the Border region.

  The despedida, or formal closing verse, is a set convention that asserts the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
  This suggests that most complete corridos have some lines in common, and that most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  However, there is no information to suggest that "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings, or that "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed someone not from the Border region.
  The passage does not provide any information about the completeness or availability of surviving corridos.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state that all complete corridos have some lines in common.
  While the passage does discuss the use of certain ready-made lines in corridos, it is possible that some complete corridos do not share these lines.
  However, the passage strongly implies that there is a high degree of generic continuity among corridos, and that the use of familiar linguistic and thematic conventions is a defining characteristic of the genre.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  CJD is a degenerative form of dementia in humans that causes nerve cell death in the brain.
  Prions are a type of protein pathogen that cause CJD.

  D: The passage explains that prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. Therefore, the statement that the body has a natural defense against CJD contradicts the passage. 
  E: The passage explains that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood. Therefore, the statement that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce is supported by the passage. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge.
  Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
  Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain.
  Prions possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape.
  Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way.
  The body does not produce an immune response when prions are present.
Thought:
  The author would be least likely to agree with a statement that contradicts the established facts about prions and CJD.
  A: The passage discusses how abnormal prions collect in the brain and ultimately destroy nerve cells. Therefore, this is not a statement the author would be least likely to agree with.
  B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, therefore the author would not agree with the statement that some patients will recover from the disease.
  C: The passage discusses how prions reproduce without nucleic acid, and how this discovery was surprising to scientists. Therefore, this is not a statement the author would be least likely to agree with.
  D: The passage discusses how the body does not produce an immune response when prions are present. Therefore, this is not a statement the author would be least likely to agree with.
  E: The passage discusses how scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction. Therefore, this is a statement the author would be least likely to disagree with, as it is acknowledged in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a degenerative form of dementia in humans, which causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes.
  - Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly of protein, which scientists dubbed as "prion."
  - Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, but they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape.
  - Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  - Because prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
Thought:
  - The author would least likely agree with a statement that contradicts one of the established facts mentioned in the passage.
  - A: The passage describes how prions cause neurological disease, so the author would agree that the presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  - B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, so the author would least likely agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  - C: The passage describes how prions reproduce themselves without nucleic acid, so the author would agree that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  - D: The passage states that the body does not produce an immune response to prions, so the author would agree that the body has no natural defense against CJD.
  - E: The passage acknowledges that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce, so the author would agree that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
  - Therefore, the answer is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism:
  - There is no statement in the passage that contradicts this answer choice.
  - Therefore, the answer is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes a new type of protein pathogen called prions, which can cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans.
  CJD is a degenerative form of dementia that is inevitably fatal.
  Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction and do not elicit an immune response from the body.
  The exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction are not yet completely understood.
Thought: 
  The author seems to support the idea that prions are a new type of infectious pathogen that can cause CJD.
  The author also emphasizes that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  The author also notes that the body does not produce an immune response when prions are present.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with choice C that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  The author would be least likely to agree with choice B that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease, as the passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal.
Criticism: 
  There is nothing in the passage to suggest that the author would disagree with any of the statements other than choice B.
  However, it is worth noting that the passage does not explicitly state whether the author agrees or disagrees with any of the statements.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The economic principle of utility maximization holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
Thought: 
  The principle of utility maximization implies that all of the choices listed can be seen as rational responses to economic incentives or disincentives. 
  A waiter concealing a large part of his tip income is a rational response to an economic incentive to reduce his taxes.
  A motorist avoiding speeding on a heavily patrolled road is a rational response to the disincentive of losing her driver's license.
  An industrialist continuing to illegally discharge untreated pollutants because treatment costs exceed the penalty is a rational response to an economic disincentive.
  A government official risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because her salary is inadequate is a rational response to an economic disincentive.
  A worker physically assaulting his former supervisor is not a rational response to an economic incentive or disincentive. 
  Therefore, the least appropriately described rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the reasoning.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.

Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the historical production of art by and for political and social elites and the ways in which this art was commissioned and perceived.
Thought:
  The main point of the passage is that there have been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them, and that sociohistorical criticism of art produced by and for elites must take into account the complex relationships between patrons and artists, and between elite values and artistic subversion.
  Choice A is too narrow, as it focuses only on the social classes that commissioned art, rather than on the ways in which the art was produced and perceived.
  Choice B is a partial representation of the passage's point, as it emphasizes the limitations of sociohistorical interpretations of art, but does not fully capture the complexity of the relationship between elite values and artistic expression.
  Choice C is not a main point of the passage, as it does not reflect the passage's discussion of the ways in which art was produced and commissioned by patrons.
  Choice D is a more specific representation of the passage's point, but it overemphasizes the role of Freudian analysis in sociohistorical criticism of art, and does not fully reflect the complexity of the relationship between elite values and artistic expression.
  Choice E is the most accurate representation of the passage's main point, as it reflects the discussion of the two distinct ways in which art was produced by and for members of the elite classes.
Criticism:
  None.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: The author refers. to the early days of biotechnology (line 38) primarily in order to
Choices:
  A: furnish a brief account of the evolution of academic biotechnology research

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?

  The other phrases (highly diverse, markedly inclusive, seemingly more fragmented, alien to the European style) describe aspects of Native American autobiographical expression and do not convey the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that focused on written documents solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators. 
  Scholars limited their studies to such documents and overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
Thought: 
  The author is critical of the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies because the scholars "limited their studies" (line 2) to written documents and "overlooked" (line 4) traditional modes of communicating personal history. 
  The author believes that the scholars "failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples" (line 9) and did not understand the inclusive nature of identity in pre-contact Native American cultures (line 16). 
  The author also suggests that the scholars did not appreciate the intercultural collaboration that shaped Native American autobiographical expressions (line 51).
  Therefore, the best phrase that conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship is A: "failed to address" (line 9).
Criticism: 
  The author is critical of the earlier scholarship, but it is not clear that the author is angry or upset about the limitations of the earlier scholarship. 
  The author is simply pointing out the limitations of the earlier scholarship and arguing for a broader understanding of Native American autobiographical expressions.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  A: "failed to address" suggests a negative attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  B: "highly diverse" is used to describe Native American peoples, but it does not indicate the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
  C: "markedly inclusive" is used to describe pre-contact Native American cultures, but it does not indicate the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
  D: "seemingly more fragmented" is used to describe the mode of autobiography used by some pre-contact Native American cultures, but it does not indicate the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
  E: "alien to the European style" is used to describe the intercultural collaboration involved in some pre-contact Native American modes of autobiography, but it does not indicate the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
Thought: 
  The passage criticizes earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies for limiting their studies to written documents and overlooking traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. The author argues that this earlier scholarship has failed to address the highly diverse cultural constructs of pre-contact Native American peoples and the markedly inclusive idea of self that characterized some of these cultures. The author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship is negative.
  Therefore, the phrase that best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship is A: "failed to address".
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The passage highlights the limitations of this scholarship.
Thought: 
  The author is critical of the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The author argues that this scholarship has overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history and failed to address the cultural constructs of Native American peoples.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, or D.
  The author does describe the intercultural collaboration involved in traditional Native American modes of autobiographical expression as "alien to the European style" (line 51), but this does not necessarily reflect the author's overall attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  Therefore, the answer is not E.
  The best answer is A: "failed to address" (line 9), as the author explicitly states that earlier scholarship has overlooked important aspects of Native American modes of autobiographical expression. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies, which has primarily focused on written, as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The passage argues that this scholarship has overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history and failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples.
Thought:
  The author critiques earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies for its narrow focus on written, as-told-to life histories and failure to consider traditional, preliterate modes of personal history.
  The author's attitude toward this earlier scholarship is likely negative, since the author is pointing out its shortcomings and suggesting that it has overlooked important aspects of Native American culture.
  Of the given choices, "failed to address" (line 9) and "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24) have negative connotations, but they do not fully capture the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  "Highly diverse" (line 10), "markedly inclusive" (line 16), and "alien to the European style" (line 51) are neutral or positive phrases that describe aspects of Native American culture or modes of personal history.
  Of these, "alien to the European style" (line 51) may suggest some contrast or difference from European culture, but it does not necessarily convey a negative attitude.
Criticism:
  The author is critical of the limitations of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies, but the passage does not express a clear or strong attitude toward that scholarship.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The author argues that scholars have focused too narrowly on written, as-told-to life histories and have overlooked preliterate modes of communicating personal history. 
  The author also notes that pre-contact Native American cultures had a markedly inclusive idea of self and tended to express life experiences through language, dance, drama, and other non-written forms.
Thought: 
  The question asks for the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies. 
  The author criticizes the earlier scholarship for being too narrow and overlooking important aspects of Native American culture, such as preliterate modes of communication and the inclusive idea of self. 
  The author does not use overtly positive language to describe the earlier scholarship, and instead uses phrases like "failed to address" and "seemingly more fragmented" to suggest limitations. 
  Therefore, the best answer is either A: "failed to address" or D: "seemingly more fragmented."
Criticism: 
  While both A and D could be seen as indicating a negative attitude toward the earlier scholarship, the phrase "seemingly more fragmented" is not necessarily negative in itself, as it simply describes a difference between Native American and European modes of autobiography. 
  Therefore, the best answer is A: "failed to address," which more clearly conveys the author's critical attitude toward the limitations of earlier scholarship.
Action: Answer("A")

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism
  D: admiration for its subtle critique of contemporary culture
  E: appreciation for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  Smith's Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of increased size and specialization for efficiency.
  However, increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopoly and market power.
Thought: 
  The author is making a connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  To undermine this connection, we need to find an option that shows that increased size does not necessarily result in market power.
  A talks about the existence of regional monopoly power despite the presence of larger businesses elsewhere, so it does not undermine the connection.
  B talks about the impact of narrower tasks on worker salaries and does not address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  C suggests that businesses collude to set prices, which still implies market power and does not undermine the connection.
  D suggests that the size required for increasing returns varies widely, but it does not address whether increasing size leads to market power.
  E suggests that the gains in productivity from making workers more specialized may be offset by other factors, but it does not address whether increasing size leads to market power.
  None of the options undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale lead to a natural tendency towards monopoly.
  The author claims that the invisible hand requires many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power.
Thought: 
  If there are businesses able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions, it would suggest that increasing returns to scale do not always lead to a natural tendency towards monopoly.
  Therefore, this would undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
  The answer is A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions. 
Criticism: 
  You are correct that this choice would suggest that increasing returns to scale do not always lead to a natural tendency towards monopoly.
  However, this choice does not directly undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power, nor does it address the role of competition in preventing monopoly power.
  Choice C more directly addresses the issue of collusion among a few players in an industry to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the tension between increased size and monopoly power.
  Increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopolies.
  The invisible hand requires many competitors in each industry.
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power.
  In order to have many competitors in each industry, there must not be increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, if there is evidence that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopoly power, it would undermine the author's argument.
  A: This statement describes a case where there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region, but it does not necessarily undermine the author's argument about increasing returns to scale.
  B: This statement discusses the effect of specialization on worker salaries, but it does not necessarily undermine the author's argument about the relationship between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
  C: This statement supports the author's argument that natural monopolies can form when an industry is dominated by only a few players.
  D: This statement suggests that the size required to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, which does not necessarily undermine the author's argument about the relationship between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
  E: This statement suggests that there are other factors that can offset gains in productivity achieved by increasing specialization, which could undermine the author's argument that increasing returns to scale lead to natural monopolies.
Criticism:
  The statement in E could be seen as a weak argument against the author's position, as it is only one factor that could potentially offset gains in productivity due to specialization.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes a contradiction between the concepts of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of increased size and specialization for increasing efficiency and productivity.
  However, increasing returns to scale can lead to natural tendencies toward monopoly, which can undermine the Invisible Hand's ability to promote competition and benefit the common good.
Thought:
  The author suggests that the connection between increased size and monopoly power is a significant challenge to the idea that free markets always get it right.
  The author implies that increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopolies that can undermine competition.
  Therefore, any statement that weakens the connection between increased size and monopoly power would undermine the author's argument.
  A: This statement suggests that larger businesses in some regions do not necessarily dominate their industry, so the connection between increased size and monopoly power is not universal.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  C: This statement supports the author's argument that natural monopolies can emerge from larger companies and undermine competition.
  D: This statement suggests that the connection between increased size and monopoly power may be less universal than the author suggests, but it does not undermine the author's argument entirely.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Criticism: 
  Option A does not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power in general, but it does suggest that the relationship is complex and may depend on other factors.
  Option C supports the author's argument rather than undermining it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopolies.
  A: This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  B: This statement is about the effect of specialization on worker's salaries, and is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement supports the argument that natural monopolies tend to arise when an industry is dominated by a few players.
  D: This statement is relevant to the argument, as it suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns varies across industries.
  E: This statement is relevant to the argument, as it suggests that there may be diminishing returns to specialization beyond a certain point.
Thought: 
  The author argues that natural monopolies can arise due to increasing returns to scale.
  The argument assumes that there is a strong connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  If the size needed to achieve increasing returns varies widely across industries, this would weaken the connection between size and monopoly power, as some industries may be able to achieve the benefits of increased size without becoming monopolies.
  Therefore, D is the most likely answer.
Criticism: 
  None identified.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  Smith's example of the pin factory emphasizes the benefits of increased size for efficiency and productivity.
  However, increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which undermines the idea of many competitors in each industry for the invisible hand to work properly.
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which undermines the idea of many competitors in each industry for the invisible hand to work properly.
  If there are industries where larger businesses do not have a significant advantage over smaller businesses in achieving increasing returns to scale, then this would weaken the argument that increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power.
  Therefore, D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that there is a contradiction inherent in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory suggests that there are increasing returns to scale, which can lead to monopoly power.
  The Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The author argues that the Pin Factory suggests that there are increasing returns to scale, which can lead to monopoly power.
  The Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power.
  Therefore, anything that suggests that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopoly power would undermine the author's argument.
  Choice A suggests that larger businesses do not necessarily have monopoly power in all regions, which would weaken the idea that larger businesses tend to drive smaller businesses out of business.
  Choice B is about worker salaries, which is not directly related to the idea of increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
  Choice C suggests that businesses collude to set prices, which is a form of monopoly power, and therefore does not undermine the author's argument.
  Choice D suggests that the size required to achieve increasing returns varies by industry, which is already acknowledged by the author and does not undermine the argument.
  Choice E suggests that there may be offsetting factors to increased specialization, but it does not specifically address the idea of increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
  Therefore, only choice A would undermine the author's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the tension between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of increased size and specialization, which can lead to increasing returns to scale.
  However, increasing returns to scale can lead to natural tendencies toward monopoly.
Thought: 
  The author argues that the invisible hand works best with many competitors in each industry, so that no one can exert monopoly power.
  If there are cases where larger businesses do not have monopoly power, it would weaken the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice A suggests that there are cases where larger businesses do not have monopoly power in some regions, which would undermine the connection.
  Therefore, A is the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the tension between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory represents the idea that increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopoly power.
  The Invisible Hand represents the idea that a competitive marketplace can lead to the common good.
  The author argues that free markets require many competitors in each industry to avoid monopoly power. 
Thought:
  The author claims that natural monopoly power is a result of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, if there were an example of an industry where increasing returns did not lead to natural monopoly power, it would undermine the author's argument.
  A: This answer option describes a situation where some businesses have monopoly power in some regions, but not in others. This does not necessarily undermine the author's argument about the relationship between increasing returns and monopoly power.
  B: This answer option describes a situation where workers are not able to command as high a salary when their tasks become narrower. This is not relevant to the author's argument about the relationship between increasing returns and monopoly power.
  C: This answer option describes a situation where businesses collude to set prices as high as a true monopoly would. This reinforces the author's argument that free markets require many competitors in order to avoid monopoly power.
  D: This answer option describes a situation where the size required to achieve increasing returns varies widely from industry to industry. This is not relevant to the author's argument about the relationship between increasing returns and monopoly power.
  E: This answer option describes a situation where gains in productivity from increasing specialization are offset by other factors. This is not relevant to the author's argument about the relationship between increasing returns and monopoly power.
Conclusion:
  Answer option C reinforces the author's argument, and answer options A, B, D, and E are not relevant to the author's argument. Therefore, the best answer is C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes efficiency through increased size and specialization.
  The Invisible Hand emphasizes the power of competition in a market economy.
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
Thought: 
  The author claims that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  If there are industries where larger businesses do not dominate and smaller businesses are able to compete, then this would undermine the idea that increasing returns to scale always lead to monopoly power.
  Answer A suggests that this is the case, as there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  Therefore, answer A would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society

  He believed that art should be based on reality, but that reality was more than just the tangible.
  He did not believe that realism always facilitated the exposure of social inequities or contributed to the creation of a new society.
  Therefore, the answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct. 
  The passage clearly states that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it, and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Therefore, he disagreed with the radical critics' view that reality had to be depicted "as it is."

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's philosophy of science, which emphasizes the importance of negative evidence and the search for evidence that would disprove theories.

Thought: 
  Passage A emphasizes the importance of negative evidence and the search for evidence that would disprove theories.
  Passage B provides two examples of scientists revising their theories based on new evidence.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the political diversity of Mexican American activists between 1930 and 1960.
  The passage questions the extent to which the views of these activists were representative of the larger Mexican American population.
  It is not clear how different variables, such as patterns of immigration and naturalization, influence ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States led to a new generation of leaders who were more politically active.
  However, it is unclear whether this outlook extended beyond these activists to the larger population.
  The passage does not provide evidence that ethnic consciousness increases or decreases based on rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization or assimilation into the culture of the United States.
  Therefore, choices A, C, and E can be eliminated.
  The passage suggests that the political influence of Mexican American leaders may account for some variations in ethnic consciousness, but it is not clear to what extent.
  Therefore, D may be a possible answer, but it is not directly supported by the passage.
  Thus, the best answer is B, which suggests that an increase in the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States may lead to an increase in ethnic consciousness.
Criticism:
  While the passage suggests that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States led to a new generation of politically active leaders, it does not directly state that this resulted in an increase in ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, the answer of B may be an inference that goes beyond what is explicitly stated in the passage.

  The passage does not support statement A, as it does not connect an increase in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization to an increase in ethnic consciousness.
  The passage does mention that the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased by 1930, but it does not support statement B, as it does not connect an increase in the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States to an increase in ethnic consciousness.
  The passage does not support statement C, as it does not connect an increase in assimilation into the culture of the United States to a decrease in ethnic consciousness.
  The passage does not support statement D, as it does not provide evidence that variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders account for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  The passage does support statement E, as it suggests that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization may account for variations in ethnic consciousness, and that these variables help to create variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the political diversity of Mexican American activists and potential flaws in the study of their political views.
  The passage mentions that the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States increased between 1930 and 1960.
Thought:
  The passage does not outright state that ethnic consciousness increases or decreases with any of the factors listed in the answer choices.
  The passage does suggest that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States may have led to a new generation of more politically active leaders, but it is unclear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists.
  The passage also suggests that there may be other important variables, such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, that influence ethnic consciousness.
  The passage does not discuss the relationship between assimilation and ethnic consciousness.
  The passage also does not discuss the influence of Mexican American leaders over the population at large.

  The passage identifies two flaws in Garcia's study.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the Mexican American Generation and critiques Garcia's study of this group. 
  The passage argues that Garcia's study suffers from two flaws, one of which is that he may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period.
  The passage suggests that without a better understanding of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  The passage does not support any of the choices directly.
  However, it suggests that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States may not necessarily result in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound
  C: the royalties paid to authors by their publisbers
  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
  E: the total sales ofa book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the economic benefits of digital publishing.
  The author argues that digital publishing eliminates the costs associated with printing, selling, and distributing physical books.
  The author expects that digital publishing will eventually become more common than traditional publishing.
Thought:
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" likely refers to a group of costs that are no longer relevant under digital publishing.
  The author has already argued that digital publishing eliminates the costs of printing, selling, and distributing physical books.
  Therefore, the phrase "whole categories of expense" likely refers to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
  Choice D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books is the best answer.
Criticism:
  It is possible that the phrase "whole categories of expense" could also refer to other costs that are eliminated under digital publishing, such as the costs of warehousing and shipping books to wholesalers and retail stores.
  However, the context of the passage suggests that the author is primarily referring to costs that are specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that digital publishing will be less expensive than traditional publishing.
  Digital publishing eliminates the costs of warehousing, shipping, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers.
  The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" to refer to a group of costs that are irrelevant to digital publication.
Thought:
  The author argues that digital publishing eliminates certain categories of expenses that are irrelevant to digital publication, making it less expensive than traditional publishing.
  Therefore, the phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books, which are irrelevant to digital publication.
  The answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Criticism:
  The answer choice B: the price paid to have books printed and bound, could also be a possible answer because the author mentioned that books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines, which is less expensive than traditional printing.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the potential for digitization to change the economics of book publishing. 
Thought:
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" suggests that the author is talking about a significant number of costs that are being eliminated by digital publishing.
  The passage mentions that digital publishing eliminates the costs of warehousing, shipping, displaying, and returning unsold books, so it seems likely that these are the costs referred to in the phrase "whole categories of expense."
  The other options do not seem to fit the context of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The author discusses how digital publishing eliminates certain costs that are associated with traditional publishing. 
A: The fees collected by literal agents from their clients are not mentioned as a category of expense that is eliminated by digital publishing.

E: The total sales of a book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller is not mentioned as a category of expense that is eliminated by digital publishing.
Thought: The author is discussing how digital publishing eliminates certain costs that are associated with traditional publishing. The phrase "whole categories of expense" indicates that multiple categories of expenses are being eliminated. The author then goes on to mention specific examples of costs that are eliminated, such as warehousing, shipping, and displaying physical books. Therefore, the best answer is B: the price paid to have books printed and bound.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses jury nullification and the problems that arise from juries having the power to nullify.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be useful when the law is unjust or when the circumstances are extenuating.
Thought: 
  The authors of the passages may disagree over the role of juries in the legal system.
  Passage A argues that jury nullification is problematic because juries are not legislators and may not have sufficient evidence to make a reasoned decision.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be useful when the law is unjust or when the circumstances are extenuating.
  Therefore, the authors may disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  The answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains what jury nullification is and explores the problems that can arise from it.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can serve as a safety valve to prevent overzealous police and prosecutors and can also assist the legislature in identifying problematic laws.
Thought:
  The passages do not seem to directly disagree over options A, B, C, or E.
  However, Passage A argues that juries are not legislators and should not interpret the law, while Passage B argues that jury nullification can assist the legislature in identifying problematic laws. There may be some level of disagreement over whether juries should have the power to interpret the law in certain circumstances.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over option D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the problems associated with jury nullification, such as the lack of knowledge about how often it occurs and the possibility of insufficient evidence and lack of accountability.
  Passage B suggests that jury nullification can act as a safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous or when a law is unjust, and can even indicate to the legislature that there is a problem with a law.
Thought:
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B seem to disagree over the usefulness of jury nullification. 
  Passage A argues that the problems with jury nullification outweigh any potential benefits, while Passage B argues that jury nullification can have useful functions, such as correcting for overzealous police and prosecutors or unjust laws.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree over whether jury nullification is a useful tool or not.
  None of the options directly address the issue of the usefulness of jury nullification, but D comes closest by suggesting that juries have the power to interpret the law, which is a key aspect of jury nullification.
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism:
  It is possible that the authors agree on the issue of the interpretation of the law and that the disagreement is more nuanced. For example, they may agree that juries have the power to interpret the law but disagree on the circumstances under which nullification is appropriate.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the problems with jury nullification, including the jury's lack of accountability, insufficient evidence, and potential misuse of power.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can serve as a safety valve to prevent overzealous prosecution and to signal to the legislature that a law may be unjust.
Thought:
  The authors of both passages seem to agree that jury nullification can have both positive and negative consequences.
  Passage A cautions against the potential problems with jury nullification, while Passage B argues that it can serve as a valuable check on the legal system.
  The passages do not seem to disagree on whether juries should be more forthcoming about their reasoning, whether laws are subject to scrutiny and debate, whether elected officials are more biased than jurors, or whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion.
  However, the passages do seem to disagree on whether juries have the power to interpret the law. Passage A argues that the role of interpreting the law belongs to elected or appointed judges, while Passage B suggests that jury nullification can serve as a form of interpretation and feedback to the legislature.
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses jury nullification and the problems it creates.
  Passage B discusses how jury nullification can assist the legislature when the jury believes a law is unjust.
  A: The passages do not directly address whether juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts.
  B: Both passages agree that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people.
  C: Passage A expresses concern about the jury's power to nullify and its lack of accountability. Passage B does not discuss whether elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors.
  D: Passage A argues that the jury is not a legislative body and should not have the power to interpret the law. Passage B argues that the jury can assist the legislature by indicating when a law may be unjust.
  E: Passage B discusses how the jury can act as a safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous.
Thought:
  The passages seem to agree that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate, which eliminates B as a possible answer.
  The passages do not discuss whether elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors, so C is not the correct answer.
  Passage A argues that juries do not have the power to interpret the law, which would make D the correct answer.
  Both passages agree that police and prosecutors have discretion, but only Passage B discusses whether they should have less discretion. Since Passage B argues that the jury can act as a safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous, it is unlikely that the authors disagree over this issue.
Criticism:
  It is possible that the authors of the passages have different views on whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion, but neither passage provides evidence to support this.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses jury nullification and the problems it can create.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful safety valve and can assist the legislature.
  A: Passage A does not address whether juries should be more forthcoming about their reasoning behind their verdicts.
  B: Passage A argues that reasonable people can disagree about the proper reach of criminal laws, but that the place for them to air their views is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a way of indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with a law in question.
  C: Passage A does not address the relative biases of elected officials and jurors.
  D: Passage A argues that juries are not legislators and that they do not have the obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a way of indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with a law in question. Neither passage directly addresses whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  E: Passage A does not address whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue. Passage B argues that in cases where police and prosecutors are overzealous, the jury can act as a safety valve.
Thought: 
  The authors of both passages seem to agree that jury nullification is a complicated issue with both potential benefits and problems.
  While Passage A focuses on the problems created by jury nullification, Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful safety valve and can assist the legislature.
  However, neither passage directly addresses whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue.
  Thus, the authors would most likely disagree over whether laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people, as Passage A argues that the place for such scrutiny and debate is in public, while Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a way of indicating a problem with a law to the legislature.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses jury nullification and argues that it is problematic because it is often used without explanation or sufficient evidence, and because juries are not elected or accountable lawmakers.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be useful when the law is unjust or when a case is too trivial or extenuating for a conviction, and that it can assist the legislature by indicating problems with a law.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration
  D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
  E: Some of the refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today contain chemicals known to be environmentally damaging.

  It mentions that CFCs were banned in North America in the late 1970s, before the Montreal Protocol was developed in 1987.
  Therefore, D is the most strongly supported statement.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Molina and Rowland discovered that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  CFCs slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere, where they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine.
  The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  In 1974, Molina and Rowland estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production.
  The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
  Molina and Rowland's work led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought: 
  The passage mentions the Montreal Protocol, which is an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases, including CFCs.
  The passage also mentions that CFCs were banned in North America in the late 1970s.
  Therefore, it is likely that the Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
  However, the passage does not mention whether refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do, or whether CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration.
  The passage also does not mention whether some of the refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today contain chemicals known to be environmentally damaging.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
Criticism: 
  There is no information in the passage to support the idea that refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do, or that CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration.
  Similarly, the passage does not mention whether some of the refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today contain chemicals known to be environmentally damaging.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage is about the discovery of the depletion of the ozone layer by manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
  Molina and Rowland's research showed how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  CFCs are highly volatile chemicals used in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants.
  Chlorine atoms released from CFCs destroy ozone molecules and increase the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere.
  The Montreal Protocol of 1987 led to the ban of CFC production worldwide.
Thought:
  The passage provides information on the discovery of CFCs and their impact on the ozone layer.
  The passage mentions the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals after the ban of CFCs, but there is no mention of the specifics of these chemicals.
  The passage does not mention the energy efficiency of CFCs or their use in refrigeration components.
  The passage mentions the ban of CFC production in North America in the late 1970s, but this was before the Montreal Protocol of 1987.
  The passage does not provide information on the manufacturing of refrigerant chemicals today.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
Criticism:
  There is no mention in the passage that the cessation of CFC production in North America was a result of the Montreal Protocol.
  However, the passage does mention that the Montreal Protocol led to the ban of CFC production worldwide, which suggests that CFC production in North America was likely influenced by the international agreement.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the harmful effects of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone layer.
- CFCs were used in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants.
- Two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, were instrumental in bringing attention to the problem of ozone depletion caused by CFCs.
- Molina and Rowland's work led to the Montreal Protocol of 1987, an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought:
- The passage does not mention any specific refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs.
- The passage does mention that the ban on CFCs in North America led to the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals, but it does not provide any information on the specifics of these chemicals.
- The passage does not provide any information on the energy efficiency of CFCs in refrigeration components.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone
  B: testing to see whether the chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there
  C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine
  D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine
  E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation

Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage states that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, and that they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation.
  Therefore, testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be the most useful experiment in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: 
  The other experiments mentioned in the answer choices could also potentially be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  However, the passage specifically mentions that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, and that chlorine is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Therefore, testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be particularly important in determining whether the chemical could damage the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the harmful effects of CFCs on the ozone layer and the need to find a replacement without damaging the ozone layer.
  A: Testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone is not directly related to the harmful effects of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  B: Testing to see whether the chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there is important, but not directly related to the harmful effects of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  C: Testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine is directly related to the harmful effects of CFCs on the ozone layer because the reaction of CFCs with chlorine is a key factor in the depletion of the ozone layer.
  D: Testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine is not directly related to the harmful effects of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  E: Testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation is important, but not directly related to the harmful effects of CFCs on the ozone layer.
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage explains that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Molina and Rowland observed that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, and the resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Therefore, testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. 
  The passage also discusses how Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland advocated for a policy response to this environmental threat, which eventually led to the development of an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding how chemicals interact with ozone and chlorine in the atmosphere.
  Therefore, the most useful experiment would be testing to see whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine, as this would help determine if the chemical would also deplete the ozone layer like CFCs do.
  The other experiments listed are not as directly relevant to determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide information on whether the chemical would react with chlorine in the same way that CFCs do, so it is possible that testing for this specific reaction may not be the most useful experiment for determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  However, given the emphasis on the importance of understanding chemical interactions with ozone and chlorine in the atmosphere, it is still a reasonable answer choice.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs deplete the ozone layer by releasing chlorine when broken down by ultraviolet radiation.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  The depletion of the ozone layer will continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
Thought:
  The question is asking which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage provides information on how CFCs damage the ozone layer by releasing chlorine.
  Therefore, the most useful experiment would be to test the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine, like CFCs do.
  Choice C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine is the best answer.
Criticism:
  The passage does not provide information on other forms of oxygen or chemicals commonly found in the lower atmosphere that could be used as a replacement for CFCs.
  The passage only discusses the chemical reaction between CFCs and chlorine, so testing for chemical properties shared with chlorine may not be the most useful experiment.
  Testing to see if the chemical would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation may not be the most useful experiment as it does not address the issue of whether the chemical would react with chlorine and damage the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery that CFCs contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, which is a protective layer of ozone in the stratosphere that shields the earth from ultraviolet radiation.
  Molina and Rowland discovered that CFCs release chlorine when subjected to ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere, which then chemically reacts with ozone to destroy it.
  The passage discusses the need for a replacement for CFCs that would not damage the ozone layer.
Thought: 
  The best way to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer would be to test whether the chemical releases chlorine when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, as this is the mechanism by which CFCs damage the ozone layer.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state that this is the best way to determine whether a replacement for CFCs would be safe for the ozone layer, but it is strongly implied based on the discussion of how CFCs damage the ozone layer and the need for a replacement that would not have the same effect.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs, which are a type of chemical.
  The passage also discusses the chemical reaction between chlorine and ozone that contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer.
  The passage notes that the depletion of the ozone layer was recognized as a pressing environmental threat and led to the development of an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought:
  The question is asking which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Since CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, it would be important to test the new chemical to determine if it would have the same effect.
  The passage notes that the ozone layer is depleted by the chemical reaction between CFCs and chlorine, so testing to determine whether a new chemical would react with chlorine would be most useful.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism:
  There are some potential issues with this answer.
  While testing the chemical to determine whether it would react with chlorine would be useful, it may not be sufficient to determine whether the chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Other factors, such as the chemical's stability and persistence in the atmosphere, could also be important in determining its impact on the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
  CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is a pressing environmental threat.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage does not provide a clear answer to this question.
  However, it does mention that CFCs chemically react with chlorine, which leads to the destruction of the ozone layer.
  Therefore, testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be the most useful experiment in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The other experiments listed could be useful in assessing the chemical's properties, but would not necessarily determine whether it could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) deplete the ozone layer in the stratosphere, which protects the Earth from ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
  Molina and Rowland showed that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, and that chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is a significant environmental threat, and there was an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage describes how CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, and how chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that destroys the ozone.
  Therefore, it would be useful to test whether a potential replacement chemical would chemically react with chlorine, like CFCs do, and whether it would also lead to the depletion of the ozone layer.
  Choice C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine, seems like the best option to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Criticism: 
  While choice C seems like a reasonable answer, the question is asking for the most useful experiment, and other experiments may also be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  For example, testing to see whether a chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone (choice A) or testing to see whether the chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there (choice B) could also be important factors to consider.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. 
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs react with the atmosphere and cause damage to the ozone layer.
  The passage mentions that the international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) was developed to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The text describes how CFCs chemically react with the atmosphere and deplete the ozone layer.
  Therefore, testing to determine whether a chemical would chemically react with chlorine, like CFCs, would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism:
  The passage mentions that the ozone layer screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation and that it is a toxic form of oxygen.
  However, the passage does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that testing whether a chemical reacts with chlorine would be the most useful experiment in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. 
  It is possible that testing the chemical to determine if it breaks down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation could also be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to CFCs.
  CFCs are highly volatile chemicals that chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is caused by the chemical reaction between CFCs and ozone in the presence of ultraviolet radiation.
  Chlorine, a constituent element of CFCs, is responsible for the breakdown of ozone.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage discusses that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer and that the depletion is caused by the chemical reaction between CFCs and ozone in the presence of ultraviolet radiation.
  Therefore, it would be most useful to test the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine, which is a constituent element of CFCs that is responsible for the breakdown of ozone.
  Option C: Testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine is the most useful experiment for determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon

  According to Passage A, a disturbing force is one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists typically need to derive a theory's predictions.
  Passage B describes the auxiliary assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus, which was incorrect.
  This incorrect assumption was a disturbing force that led to incorrect predictions about the orbit of Uranus.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Uranus.
Criticism: 
  There is no clear indication in Passage B that Uranus itself was a disturbing force.
  Rather, the incorrect auxiliary assumption about the existence of other planets was the disturbing force.
  So, the answer may be more accurately described as "the auxiliary assumption about the existence of other planets" rather than Uranus itself.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science, highlighting his point about the power of negative evidence.
  Passage A also points out that when a prediction fails, there is usually more than one possible explanation, and negative evidence rarely is conclusive.

Thought:
  The question asks which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force.
  In Passage B, astronomers use Newton's laws to predict the orbit of planets.
  They also use auxiliary assumptions, including the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets.
  When the predicted orbit does not match the observed orbit, astronomers change their auxiliary assumptions to account for the discrepancy.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  The discovery of Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations suggests that Uranus was affected by the gravitational force of Neptune.
  Therefore, Neptune most clearly illustrates a disturbing force as described in Passage A.
  The answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism:
  There is no significant criticism to the answer. The answer is supported by the information presented in the passages.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:

Popper believes that negative evidence is more powerful than positive evidence because positive evidence cannot prove a hypothesis, but negative evidence can disprove it. Popper also believes that scientific research involves searching for evidence that would disprove theories. 
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and the planet's orbit. Astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict Uranus's orbit, but the predictions were incorrect. They changed their assumptions to include the existence of another planet (Neptune), which was later discovered and brought their calculations into alignment. The passage also discusses the prediction of Mercury's orbit, which was not borne out until Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced.

Thought: 
  Passage A describes "disturbing forces" as one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists use when deriving theories' predictions. 
  Passage B discusses auxiliary assumptions that astronomers made when predicting Uranus's orbit, including the assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. 
  The discovery of Neptune, which was not accounted for in the initial predictions, suggests that the assumption about the absence of planets was incorrect. 
  Therefore, Neptune is a possible example of a "disturbing force" in Passage A.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, which involves the power of negative evidence, logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence, and the search for negative evidence in scientific research. 
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and Neptune, the prediction of their orbits, and the hypotheses about other planets (Vulcan) based on the auxiliary assumptions and Newton's laws. 
Thought: 
  In passage A, line 26, disturbing forces are mentioned as one of the auxiliary premises needed for experiments to work out as predicted. 
  In passage B, the prediction of Uranus's orbit was based on auxiliary assumptions that no planets existed in its vicinity. 
  However, when the astronomers observed Uranus's orbit, it was incorrect. 
  One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was an error in the auxiliary assumptions, such as the existence of other planets.

  Passage A states that auxiliary premises are often used in scientific predictions, which may include the correct functioning of instrumentation and the absence of disturbing forces.
Thought:
  Passage B describes the discovery of Uranus and Neptune, and the failed predictions of the orbit of Mercury using Newton's laws.
  The astronomers used auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets to predict the orbit of Uranus.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the observations were made, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  They changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  This discovery was made by changing the auxiliary assumptions, which may have included the absence of disturbing forces.
  Therefore, the correct answer is the planet that was discovered near Uranus, which is C: Neptune.
Criticism: 
  There is no explicit mention of a disturbing force in Passage B. 
  While the discovery of Neptune did require a change in auxiliary assumptions, it is not clear whether this change was due to a disturbing force.
  It is possible that the discovery of Neptune was due to other factors, such as errors in calculations or incomplete data.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Popper's philosophy of science and the power of negative evidence.
  Passage B describes the discovery of Uranus and the attempts to predict its orbit using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  Passage B also describes the subsequent discovery of Neptune and the attempts to predict the orbit of Mercury.
Thought:
  The question asks for a situation in Passage B that illustrates a disturbing force, as described in Passage A.
  According to Passage A, auxiliary premises can be a source of disturbing forces.
  In Passage B, the auxiliary assumption that "no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus" (line 8) was one of the assumptions used to predict its orbit.
  However, the actual orbit did not match the predicted orbit, which suggests that one of the premises must be false.
  One possible explanation is that the auxiliary assumption about the absence of nearby planets was false, which is a type of disturbing force.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Uranus.
Criticism:
  The question asks for a situation that illustrates a disturbing force, but it is not clear what the question means by "disturbing force".
  Passage A describes disturbing forces as "additional 'auxiliary' premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc." (lines 30-32).
  It is not clear if the question is asking for a specific type of auxiliary premise that is a disturbing force, or if it is asking for any situation that involves a discrepancy between predicted and observed results.
  If the latter is the case, then the answer could also be C: Neptune, since its discovery was necessary to explain the observed orbit of Uranus.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science.
  Popper's main point is that negative evidence is more powerful than positive evidence.
  Popper thinks that a scientific theory must be testable and that the search for negative evidence is at the heart of scientific research.
  Passage B illustrates how astronomers used Newton's laws to predict the orbits of Uranus and Mercury.
  The astronomers had to use auxiliary assumptions to derive their predictions, and when their predictions failed, they had to consider the possibility of disturbing forces.
Thought: 
  The question asks for an example of a disturbing force in Passage B.
  Passage A describes a disturbing force as an auxiliary premise that can lead to false predictions.
  In Passage B, the astronomers had to use auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbits of Uranus and Mercury.
  When their predictions failed, they had to consider the possibility of a disturbing force, such as the existence of another planet.
  Uranus, the sun, Neptune, and Mercury are all mentioned in Passage B, but only one of them is an example of a disturbing force.
  The passage does not mention the moon, so it is not a possible answer.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is the planet that the astronomers hypothesized to exist, Vulcan, which is not mentioned as a choice.
  The next most likely answer is Neptune, which the astronomers did not expect to exist and had to take into account when their predictions failed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, focusing on his view that negative evidence is more powerful than positive evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of the planet Uranus and the subsequent attempts to predict its orbit, as well as the later attempts to predict the orbit of Mercury.
  The passage mentions "auxiliary" premises, which are additional premises beyond the theory being tested that are necessary for making predictions and experimental observations.
  Disturbing forces are mentioned in Passage A as one example of auxiliary premises, which can cause experimental observations to deviate from predicted outcomes.
Thought: 
  Passage A explains that auxiliary premises, such as the absence of disturbing forces, can affect experimental observations and predictions.
  Passage B describes the attempts to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury based on auxiliary premises like the mass of the sun and the existence of other planets.
  The discovery of Neptune is attributed to a change in the auxiliary premise about the existence of other planets near Uranus.
  The failure to find Vulcan as a possible explanation for the predicted orbit of Mercury suggests that there may have been an error in one of the auxiliary premises.
  The moon is not mentioned in Passage B, and it is not clear how it relates to the discussion of disturbing forces or auxiliary premises.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is one of the planets mentioned in Passage B.
  Uranus and Neptune are mentioned in the context of auxiliary premises about the existence of other planets, but they are not described as disturbing forces themselves.
  The sun is also an auxiliary premise, but it is not described as a disturbing force either.
  Mercury is the only planet mentioned in Passage B that is associated with a failed prediction and the hypothesis of a disturbing force.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Mercury.
Criticism: 
  There may be other valid interpretations of the passages that would lead to different answers.
  For example, one could argue that the discovery of Neptune is a better example of a disturbing force, since the presence of an unknown planet was disturbing the predicted orbit of Uranus.
  However, the passage does not use the term "disturbing force" in this way, and it seems more appropriate to apply the definition given in Passage A.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred that the aulbor would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?
Choices:
  A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model ofpub1ishing will be uuiikely to remain economically competitive.
  B: The primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers aud haudheld devices for reading text.
  C: The growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business.
  D: Any book will sell more copies ifit is published digitally thau if it is published traditionally.
  E: Digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.

  Traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors.
  Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to adjust to the digital model of publishing to remain economically competitive.
  Therefore, the author would agree with statement A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.

Knowledge: 
  The author argues that digital publishing will eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing due to its economic efficiency and convenience.
  The elimination of whole categories of expenses means that under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would, therefore, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds.
Thought: 
  The author argues that traditional publishers will be initially reluctant to embrace the new digital model of publishing, and the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms.
  Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors.
  The author does not suggest that publishers who fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
  The author does not suggest that widespread use of computers and handheld devices for reading text is the primary threat to the spread of digital publishing.
  The author does not suggest that digital publishing will revitalize the book retail business.
  The author does not suggest that any book will sell more copies if it is published digitally than if it is published traditionally.
  The author suggests that digital publishing will allow publishers to decrease the amount of money they allocate for printing, selling, and distributing physical books, but not for advertising their books.
  Therefore, the author would most reasonably agree with statement A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.

  The author believes that under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds.
Thought:
  The author seems to believe that traditional publishing houses will initially be reluctant to accede to the demands of literary agents for higher royalty payments to authors, and that upstart digital-publishing firms will have the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts first.
  This suggests that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing may be at a disadvantage compared to upstart digital-publishing firms.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that most digital files of books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in factories. 
  The digital publication of a book online involves no physical inventory, thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers.
Thought: 
  The author argues that digital publishing is more economically efficient and convenient for customers. 
  Given this, it is likely that publishers who fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive. 
  The author does not suggest that the primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers and handheld devices for reading text, nor does the author suggest that any book will sell more copies if it is published digitally than if it is published traditionally. 
  The author also does not suggest that digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.
  The author does not discuss the growth of digital publishing revitalizing the book retail business.
  Therefore, the most reasonable inference is that the author would agree with statement A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.

  Therefore, publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
  The answer is A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the widespread use of computers and handheld devices for reading text is the primary threat to the spread of digital publishing.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position in Russian literary criticism that went beyond the two significant and opposing directions of his time.
  As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the prevailing radical critics' view that art must find its sources in concrete reality.
  For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky would not agree with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday because this view, despite its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic, makes no distinction between reality and fantasy, which Dostoyevsky believed to be crucial.
  Moreover, this view does not recognize that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life, which is another aspect of reality that Dostoyevsky believed to be important.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would most likely have chosen D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position in the literary criticism of his time. 
  He was a realist who believed that reality was literature's crucial source. 
  For him, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. 
  He thought that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. 
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit." 
Thought: 
  The passage states that Dostoyevsky took a third position in the literary criticism of his time, which means that he did not agree with either of the two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during his time. 
  The passage also states that Dostoyevsky was a realist who believed that reality was literature's crucial source. 
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would not have agreed with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday because he believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  So, the answer is C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
Criticism: 
  None

  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky was a realist who believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  He believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with statement D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position, which was different from the two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during his time.
  One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice.

Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  He believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would not agree with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday.
  The correct answer is not A, B, or C because they support the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday.
  Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality and that the fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would not agree with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  The correct answer is D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  However, the passage does not explicitly state that Dostoyevsky would not agree with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  While Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, it is not clear from the passage if he would disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday for this reason.

Criticism: 
  The passage does not state that Dostoyevsky would disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday.

  Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature’s crucial source.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
Thought:
  The passage states that Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature’s crucial source. 
  The radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality.
  It can be inferred that Dostoyevsky believed that the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and every day is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  Therefore, the answer is D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Criticism:
  Your answer is correct. 
  The passage states that for Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. 
  Therefore, the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and every day is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday.
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky took a third position that reality was literature's crucial source.
  He believed that reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  For Dostoyevsky, reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
  The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would not agree with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday.
  The answer is not A because Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the use of the fantastic.
  The answer is not B because while Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, he did not believe that art should stand high above the present and the everyday.
  The answer is not C because Dostoyevsky believed that reality was crucial to literature, but he did not believe that reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  The answer is not D because Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  The answer is E because Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance was a contradiction in terms.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's views on literary criticism in Russia during his time.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position, which was different from the two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  The radical critics maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  Reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's position was different from the two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  The radical critics' view that art should stand high above the present and everyday is incorrect according to Dostoyevsky because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  Therefore, the answer is D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Criticism:
  The passage does not explicitly state Dostoyevsky's agreement or disagreement with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  However, Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality as necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it and his belief that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality suggest that he would disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  Therefore, the answer to this question is unclear.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  He believed that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
Thought:
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's belief that reality was crucial to literature.
  The passage also describes how he believed there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  The view that art should stand high above the present and everyday is a view that recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with the statement that the view is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  The answer is B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not directly state that Dostoyevsky agreed with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  However, the passage does describe his belief that reality was far more than the merely tangible and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, which suggests that he may have agreed with this view.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

Knowledge: The passage discusses the work of Roy Lichtenstein, who is associated with the pop art movement. Lichtenstein's paintings incorporated comic book imagery, but also had a seriousness of theme that went beyond mere parody. Pop art emerged partly in response to the fading emotional power of the previous art movement, abstract expressionism. Lichtenstein's paintings were influenced by and depicted aspects of contemporary life, but also had a deliberate naivete and nostalgia that contrasted with some other pop art. 
Thought: The author lists the themes and objects appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings to support the idea that they depict aspects of contemporary life.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session

  They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method.
  Recent legal scholarship has introduced an economic principle, the utility maximization principle, that reconciles the two positions.
  According to the utility maximization principle, a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
Thought: 
  The question asks for a scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle is an economic principle that reconciles the two positions in the debate.
  The principle suggests that a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  Therefore, the most similar scenario would be one in which an expert uses a principle from a different field to explain a phenomenon or make a point.
  A: This scenario involves an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies. This is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  B: This scenario involves a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other. This is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  C: This scenario involves a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest. This is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  D: This scenario involves a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. This is somewhat similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate, as both involve using a principle from a different field to inform a legal decision. However, this scenario does not involve reconciling two opposing positions in a debate, as the utility maximization principle does.
  E: This scenario involves a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session. This is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  Therefore, the answer is D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  A: The answer choice describes an astronomer's use of a paradox from ancient cosmology to describe a modern phenomenon.
  B: The answer choice describes a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics to illustrate a principle in drawing.
  C: The answer choice describes a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest.
  D: The answer choice describes a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a legal case.
  E: The answer choice describes a mediator's use of a short quotation from a novel to set a tone of collegiality at a bargaining session.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  The principle holds that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The expected utility of an action is determined by weighing the utilities of possible outcomes.
  The decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  Legal scholars who believe in individual choice use this principle to suggest that increasing fines and penalties will deter crime.
  Legal scholars who believe in societal influence use this principle to suggest that changing beliefs about crime and increasing access to economic institutions will deter crime.
  The principle shows that these two positions are complementary, not antithetical.
  None of the answer choices describes an analogous use of a principle to reconcile two seemingly opposed positions.
Criticism: 
  The answer choices are not relevant to the passage's discussion of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  The answer is not explicitly stated in the passage.
  However, the passage's description of the utility maximization principle and its use in the crime deterrence debate can be used to eliminate answer choices that do not deal with the same type of principle.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a debate in the legal community regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  Some scholars believe that changing societal norms, increasing access to economic opportunities, and rehabilitating offenders will reduce crime.
  Other scholars suggest that increasing fines and penalties and strengthening law enforcement is the best deterrence method.
  The utility maximization principle is introduced as a way to reconcile these two positions.
  The utility maximization principle suggests that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
Thought: 
  The passage explains how the utility maximization principle can be used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime.
  The principle suggests that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  Legal scholars can use this principle to show that increasing penalties and strengthening law enforcement and increasing economic opportunities are both effective deterrence methods.
  Therefore, the use of the utility maximization principle is similar to a physicist's use of a law of optics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other.
  Both are using one concept to explain another.
  The answer is B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention of physics or drawing in the passage, so it may not be the best answer.
  However, the other choices are even less likely to be correct.
  Therefore, B is still the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how the utility maximization principle can be used to analyze the rational decision-making behind committing a crime.
Thought: 
  The question asks for the scenario that is most similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate. 
  None of the options seem to directly relate to this topic, except for option A, which uses an ancient paradox as a metaphor to describe a phenomenon observed using new technologies.
  The use of an old concept to explain a new phenomenon is similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle to explain the decision-making behind committing a crime.
  Therefore, the answer is A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies.
Criticism: 
  It may be a stretch to compare the use of an ancient paradox to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  It is possible that another option could be a better fit.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes a debate on how to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud.
  Some scholars believe that changing societal norms, increasing access to economic institutions, and rehabilitating criminals will reduce crime.
  Other scholars believe that increasing fines and penalties, along with effective law enforcement, is the best method of deterrence.
  Recent legal scholarship suggests that the utility maximization principle can reconcile these two positions.
  The utility maximization principle holds that individuals make rational decisions based on the expected utility of each action.
Thought: 
  The passage describes how legal scholars are using the economic principle of utility maximization to reconcile two different approaches to crime deterrence.
  Therefore, the scenario that is most similar to this is one in which a scholar uses a principle or theory from another field to help explain a phenomenon.
  Option A describes an astronomer using a paradox to describe a phenomenon, which is not similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle.
  Option B describes a drawing instructor using a law of optics to demonstrate a point, which is also not similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle.
  Option C describes a botanist using a quotation from a legendary athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants, which is not similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle.
  Option D describes a judge using evidence from anthropology to support a legal decision, which is somewhat similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle, but not as close as option E.
  Option E describes a mediator using a quotation from a novel to set a tone for a bargaining session, which is similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in that both involve using a principle from one field to help explain or reconcile a situation in another field.
  Therefore, the answer is E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a debate in the legal community on how to deter deliberate crimes, using the economic principle of utility maximization to reconcile two opposing positions. 
  A: This choice discusses an astronomer's use of a paradox in ancient cosmology to explain a recent phenomenon in astronomy. It is not related to the legal debate on crime deterrence.
  B: This choice discusses a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to explain a phenomenon in art. It is not related to the legal debate on crime deterrence.
  C: This choice discusses a botanist's use of a quotation from an Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest. It is not related to the legal debate on crime deterrence.
  D: This choice discusses a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a legal decision. It is somewhat related to the legal debate on crime deterrence, but it does not involve the use of the utility maximization principle.
  E: This choice discusses a mediator's use of a quotation from a novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at a bargaining session. It is not related to the legal debate on crime deterrence.
Thought: 
  The question asks for a scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle is used to reconcile two opposing positions on crime deterrence, and that it demonstrates how the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, but rather complementary.
  Therefore, the scenario that is most similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle would be one in which a principle or framework is used to reconcile two opposing positions and demonstrate how they are complementary, rather than conflicting.
  Choice D is somewhat related to the legal debate on crime deterrence, but it does not involve the use of the utility maximization principle. 
  Therefore, none of the choices seem to be a good match for the scenario described in the passage.
Criticism: 
  The answer to this question is unclear, as none of the choices seem to be a good match for the scenario described in the passage.
  However, if we had to select the best answer, it would be D, as it is somewhat related to the legal debate on crime deterrence, even though it does not involve the use of the utility maximization principle.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a debate in the legal community regarding how to deter deliberate crimes.
  Two sides of the debate are discussed: one side believes societal norms and institutions influence individuals, while the other side believes criminal behavior is primarily the result of individual choice.
  Recent legal scholarship has introduced the economic principle of utility maximization, which suggests that a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity.
Thought: 
  The question is asking which scenario is most similar to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle.
  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle can be used to analyze a person's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, the answer choice that is most similar to this use of the principle would be one where a principle from another field is used to analyze a phenomenon in a different field.
  Answer choice A describes an astronomer's use of a paradox to describe a phenomenon observed with new technologies, which is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the legal field.
  Answer choice B describes a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate a point in drawing, which is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the legal field.
  Answer choice C describes a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest, which is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the legal field.
  Answer choice D describes a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a legal case, which is somewhat similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the legal field because it involves using evidence from a different field to analyze a legal issue.
  However, the evidence from anthropology is not a principle, and it is not clear how it is being used to analyze the legal issue.
  Answer choice E describes a mediator's use of a quotation from a novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct in a bargaining session, which is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the legal field.
Criticism: 
  The question asks for the scenario that is most similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  Answer choice D is somewhat similar, but it is unclear how evidence from anthropology is being used to analyze the legal issue.
  It is possible that there is no answer choice that is a good match for the question.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

  The passage suggests that the utility maximization principle is being used by some legal scholars to reconcile the two sides of the crime deterrence debate.
  This principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  Using this principle, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, the scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate should involve the use of a principle from a different field to help explain a phenomenon in the scholar's own field.
  Among the choices, the scenario that is most similar is B, in which a drawing instructor uses a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other.
  This is similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle because both involve the use of a principle from a different field to help explain a phenomenon in their own field.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the application of the economic principle of utility maximization to the crime deterrence debate.
Thought: 
  The question asks which scenario is most similar to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  The passage explains that the principle of utility maximization is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  This economic principle is being used to reconcile the two positions of the crime deterrence debate.
  Therefore, the scenario most similar to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle would involve using an economic principle to reconcile two opposing positions in a debate.
  Choice D is not relevant to the passage and can be eliminated.
  Choice A, B, C, and E are not related to the passage's discussion of the utility maximization principle and can be eliminated.
  The correct answer is not present.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle to analyze the rational economic choice of committing a crime.
  A: This answer choice discusses the use of a paradox as a metaphor to describe a phenomenon.
  B: This answer choice discusses the use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other.
  C: This answer choice discusses the use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest.
  D: This answer choice discusses the use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
  E: This answer choice discusses the use of a short quotation from a well-known novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle to analyze the rational economic choice of committing a crime.
  This principle helps to reconcile the debate between legal scholars who believe that crime is a result of societal norms and institutions and those who believe it is a result of individual choice.
  The principle suggests that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The principle can be used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, the most similar scenario would be one in which a principle from one field is used to analyze a phenomenon in another field.
  Answer choices A, B, C, and E all involve the use of principles or quotations from one field to make a point in another field.
  However, none of these answer choices involve the use of a principle to analyze a phenomenon, as in the passage.
  Answer choice D involves the use of evidence from one field (anthropology) to support a decision in another field (law).
  This is similar to the use of the utility maximization principle to analyze the rational economic choice of committing a crime.
  Therefore, the answer is D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on literary criticism during his time.
  Three positions are presented in the passage: one that maintains that art should stand above the present and the everyday, one that maintains that art must be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society, and one that takes a realist perspective that understands reality as deeper than the merely tangible and that the task of the writer is to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. 
Thought: 
  The passage presents three positions on literary criticism.
  The third position, which is Dostoyevsky's position, is elaborated in detail, and is differentiated from the first two positions.
  The first two positions are contrasted with Dostoyevsky's position to highlight the unique features of his perspective.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.

  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the third position is differentiated from the second position.
  Instead, the third position is differentiated from the first position.
  Therefore, a better answer might be A: Three positions are presented and each is elaborated in detail.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
The answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. The passage presents three different positions in Russian literary criticism, and the third one, which is Dostoevsky's, is presented in detail and contrasted with the first two. The first two positions are briefly summarized, but the focus of the passage is on Dostoevsky's position and how it differs from the others.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on Russian literary criticism during his time.
  There were two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism: one maintaining that art was above the present and the everyday, while the other argued that art should only exist if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position, as a realist who believed reality was a crucial source for literature but went deeper than the prevailing view among radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Dostoyevsky rejected the radical critics' demand that art must serve a particular political view and must be useful to people and society, as he believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit.
Thought: 
  The passage presents three positions on Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The first two positions are outlined briefly, while the third position, which is Dostoyevsky's, is differentiated from the first two in detail.
  Dostoyevsky's position is described in detail, including his view on reality, the role of the writer, and the meaning of artistic merit.
  The passage does not show that Dostoyevsky's position is superior or inferior to the other two positions, but rather presents his views as a different perspective.
  Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the material presented in the passage is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Criticism: 
  There are some elements of the passage that could support other answer choices, such as the emphasis on Dostoyevsky's rejection of the radical critics' demand for art to be useful, which might suggest that his position is shown to be superior to the first two positions.
  However, this emphasis is not the primary focus of the passage, and Dostoyevsky's rejection of utilitarianism is presented as a part of his overall position rather than as a basis for comparison with the other positions.
  Therefore, B remains the most accurate description of the organization of the material presented in the passage.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:

Criticism: 
  Your interpretation is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the theory of evolutionary psychology.
  Passage B describes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory.
Thought: 
  In passage A, evolutionary psychology is described as a way to explain human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution, including why apparently altruistic behavior might have evolved to promote the proliferation of genes. 
  In passage B, the author describes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory because it imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of.
  The assertion from passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory is that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology, which explains human behavior from an evolutionary perspective.
  Passage A suggests that seemingly unselfish behavior may actually be the result of genes promoting their own self-propagation.
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it attributes motives to behavior that the agent of the behavior may not be aware of or acknowledge.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage B considers evolutionary psychology to be a "conspiracy theory" because it attributes motives to behavior that may not be acknowledged by the individual exhibiting the behavior.
  The idea that genes may promote their own self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish is an example of this type of explanation.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct.
  There is no significant flaw in your reasoning.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how scholars have studied the autobiographies of Native Americans.
  It states that scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  The passage describes how pre-contact Native American cultures expressed their life experiences through oral tradition, art, and performance.
Thought:
  The term "bicultural composite authorship" is mentioned in the context of discussing the types of written documents that scholars have studied.
  The phrase seems to refer to the fact that these documents were produced through collaboration between Native American subjects and non-Native American collaborators.
  The "bicultural" aspect suggests that there are two cultures involved, while "composite authorship" suggests that the final product is a combination of contributions from both parties.
  Based on this, the best answer is D: "written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture".
Criticism:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is not explicitly defined in the passage.
  It is possible that the phrase could refer to a different type of collaboration between Native American subjects and non-Native American collaborators.
  However, the passage does suggest that the written documents studied by scholars involved some form of collaboration between two cultures.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholarship on the autobiographies of Native Americans.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe the written life histories that scholars have focused on.
Thought: 
  "Bicultural" refers to the fact that both Native American and non-Native American collaborators were involved in creating the written life histories.
  "Composite authorship" suggests that the written life histories are the product of multiple authors working together.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" refers to written life histories that were created by both Native American and non-Native American authors.
  Answer: B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" does not necessarily imply that both authors contributed equally to the finished product. 
  It could be the case that one author played a more significant role in the creation of the written life history.
  However, the phrase does suggest that both Native American and non-Native American collaborators were involved in creating the written life histories.
  Therefore, Answer B is still the best choice. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholars' studies of Native American autobiographies, and argues that scholars have focused too much on written autobiographies that were created through "bicultural composite authorship."
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the fact that the written autobiographies of Native Americans were created collaboratively by members of two different cultures.
  It seems that the phrase is meant to convey the idea that the autobiographies were not created solely by Native Americans themselves, but rather were influenced by the perspectives and expectations of non-Native American collaborators.
  Option D is the closest to this meaning, as it suggests that the autobiographies were written by members of one culture but edited and revised by members of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of focusing on written, "as-told-to" life histories of Native Americans, which have emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
  The author argues that scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  The author suggests that traditional modes of autobiography among Native American cultures were more inclusive and relational than the European concept of autobiography.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" in line 5 refers to a collaborative process of creating written life histories of Native Americans.
  The collaboration involves at least two people from different cultures.
  Each person contributes in some way to the finished product.
  Therefore, the most accurate meaning of the phrase is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  Your interpretation of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is close, but not entirely accurate.
  The phrase refers to written life histories of Native Americans that are created through collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native Americans.
  The process involves "translation, recording, and editing" by non-Native American collaborators, so the contributions of the two cultures are not necessarily equal.
  Therefore, answer choice D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture is closer to the author's intended meaning.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the limitations of studying Native American autobiographies through written documents.
  Scholars have primarily focused on "as-told-to" life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  These life histories emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the process by which the as-told-to life histories were created.
  The life histories were created collaboratively by individuals from two different cultures.
  The term "composite" suggests that the final product was a combination of contributions from both cultures.
  Therefore, the answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of most scholars' studies of Native American autobiographies.
  The scholars have focused on written documents created through "bicultural composite authorship."
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to written documents that were created with the collaboration of both Native American and non-Native American individuals.
  The document is a composite of two cultures, which is why it is called "bicultural."
  The individuals from each culture collaborate to create the document, which is why it is called "composite authorship."
  Therefore, the best answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to written documents that were created with the collaboration of both Native American and non-Native American individuals.
  However, the phrase does not necessarily mean that the two individuals contributed in the same way to the finished product, which is what choice B suggests.
  The phrase also does not necessarily mean that the document was written by two people, which is what choice B specifically states.
  Therefore, the best answer may be A or D, depending on how the phrase is interpreted.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how scholars studying Native American autobiographies have focused on written documents that were created through collaboration between Native American and non-Native American individuals.
  A: This choice incorrectly suggests that the artifacts and oral traditions of one culture were used to create a written document by a member of another culture.
  B: This choice incorrectly suggests that two people from different cultures contributed equally to the finished product.
  C: This choice incorrectly suggests that the identities of the writers cannot be determined.
  D: This choice accurately reflects the idea that a written document was created by a member of one culture and edited by a member of another culture.
  E: This choice incorrectly suggests that a written document was based on oral communication from an individual of another culture.
Thought:
  The passage discusses how Native American autobiographies have been studied as written documents that were created through collaboration between Native American and non-Native American individuals.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" likely refers to the fact that the written documents resulted from collaboration between individuals from different cultural backgrounds.
  Option D accurately reflects this idea.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is discussing the limitations of studying Native American autobiographies through written documents that were created through "bicultural composite authorship."
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the fact that the written autobiographies of Native Americans were created through collaboration between Native American individuals and non-Native American collaborators. 
  The "bicultural" aspect refers to the fact that the collaboration involves two cultures, while "composite authorship" refers to the collaborative nature of the creation of the written autobiographies.
  Therefore, the answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The answer is close, but it does not fully capture the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as used in the passage. 
  While the answer correctly identifies that the phrase refers to collaboration between individuals from different cultures, it incorrectly suggests that they contribute in the same way to the finished product. 
  The passage actually suggests that the non-Native American collaborators had a larger role in the creation of the written autobiographies than the Native American individuals did, meaning they did not contribute in the same way.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how scholars studying Native American autobiographies have focused on written documents that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators, which have emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
  The passage suggests that these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history that were oriented toward current events and often involved the participation of fellow tribal members.
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a type of autobiography that was written by two people from different cultures, with one person originally writing it and the other person editing and revising it.
  This type of autobiography emerged from the collaboration of people from different cultures and reflects the different cultural perspectives that shaped it.
  Therefore, the answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism:
  The thought process is mostly correct, but it doesn't mention that the two people involved in the bicultural composite authorship are from different cultures.
  Additionally, the passage suggests that the "bicultural composite authorship" may not necessarily involve one person writing it and the other person editing and revising it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholars' focus on "as-told-to" autobiographies of Native Americans, which were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The passage refers to this type of autobiography as "bicultural composite authorship."
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to autobiographies of Native Americans that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  These autobiographies are a product of collaboration between two cultures.
  Therefore, the answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism: 
  The answer is not A because "bicultural composite authorship" does not refer to the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture.
  The answer is not B because the passage does not state that the two people contribute in the same way to the finished product.
  The answer is not C because the identities of the writers are known, and the writings are not necessarily compiled from the writings of people from different cultures.
  The answer is not E because the autobiographies may not be based on oral communication, and the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" does not refer to the identity of the author.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: According to the passage, Dunham's work in anthropology differed from that of most other anthropologists in the 1930s in that Dunham
Choices:
  A: performed fieldwork for a very extended time period

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy
  D: conviction that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives
  E: eagerness to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk and how it affects policy decisions.
Thought: 
  The author argues against the use of the "voluntary" versus "involuntary" distinction as a basis for regulatory policy.
  The author also criticizes laypeople's judgments about voluntariness, suggesting that they are often based on factors other than whether the risk is actually voluntary.
  The author supports the principle that the government should attempt to save as many lives as possible, subject to resource constraints.
  Therefore, the author's attitude can best be described as skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's judgments and a preference for evidence-based policy that prioritizes saving lives.
  The answer is C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
Criticism: 
  The author also expresses concern about the excessive government regulation that might result from policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk, which could be interpreted as a preference for evidence-based policy that prioritizes saving lives with some consideration of resource constraints.
  So, choice B could also be considered a valid answer.
Action: Answer("C or B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks, and how this distinction is often misunderstood.

  The author is skeptical of the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
  Therefore, the answer is C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the difference between lay and expert judgments about risk and how judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. The author argues that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary" and that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
Thought: The author seems to be arguing against the idea that the voluntariness of a risk should be the main factor in determining whether or not the government should intervene to reduce that risk. The author is skeptical of laypeople's judgments about risk, arguing that they are often based on confusion and selective attention, and that notions of voluntariness are not a good guide to policy decisions. Instead, the author argues that government policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. The author also argues that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border
  B: a study focusing on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain
  C: an editorial in a contemporary newspaper from the Lower Rio Grande Border

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.

  The answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Criticism: 
  The author mentions that some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement.
  While the author argues that this fear is unfounded, it is possible that the corporation holding the patent may take legal action against the researcher for patent infringement.
  Additionally, it is possible that the corporation holding the patent may demand a prohibitively high payment for the use of the patented cell lines, which would make it difficult for the researcher to conduct the research.
  Therefore, while the answer D is the most likely option, it is not certain that the researcher will not face any obstacles in conducting the research.

Knowledge: 
  The article discusses concerns about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research.
  Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement.
  However, researchers who oppose biotechnology patents mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access.
  Judges deciding patent cases have respected a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
Thought:
  The article suggests that a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement is usually respected by judges.
  Therefore, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.

  Patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers.
  Restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals, are perceived to hinder basic research.
  Patent holders or owners of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken.
Thought:
  The author argues that scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology are confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials.
  The author suggests that patents are unlikely to be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research.

  Biotechnology patenting is now under scrutiny by scientists and policymakers due to concerns about hindering basic research.
  Restrictions on access to research materials may arise due to enforcement of a patent right or operation of a contractual agreement.
  Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials.
  Patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  There has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
Thought: 
  The author argues that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  The author also argues that researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
  Therefore, it is likely that the for-profit biotechnology corporation holding the patent will grant permission to the university researcher to use the cell lines for basic, noncommercial research.
  If the corporation does not grant permission, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued due to the tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Criticism: 
  The author argues that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  However, this argument assumes that patents will not lead to a restriction on access to research materials, which is a concern raised by the author and other researchers.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

  There are no criticisms of the idea that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  However, the passage does not provide enough information to support the idea that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain, or that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  William Uttal contends that various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a method that produces brain scans by subtracting a baseline measurement of oxygen use in the control condition from a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
Thought: 
  The passage argues against the validity of the modular theory of mind, suggesting that mental processes are not decomposable into independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  The passage explains that the subtractive method used in FMRI obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and produces a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The passage suggests that the subtractive method shows areas of the brain that are most metabolically active during the performance of certain cognitive tasks.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Criticism: 
  None.

  The passage critiques the modular theory of mind, arguing that mental processes are likely properties of a more general mental activity distributed throughout the brain, rather than distinct modules in specific regions of the brain.
Thought: 
  The passage critiques the modular theory of mind, suggesting that it may not be valid.
  The FMRI measures metabolic activity in the brain during cognitive tasks using a subtractive method.
  The subtractive method produces images of the brain that seem to show neat functional localization, but actually obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind is attractive in part because it is illustrated by the products of the subtractive method, but this does not necessarily mean that the theory is valid.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement by the passage is that "The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times." (D). The passage discusses how the FMRI measures metabolic activity by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during a cognitive task. The baseline measurement shows that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times, indicating that these regions are likely involved in general mental activity rather than specific cognitive functions.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  C: A work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  D: The best works of art improve with age.
  E: Some forms of art are superior to others.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how great perfume is not taken seriously as an art form, despite the parallels between perfumery and other more respected art forms such as painting, architecture, and music.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that perfumery is a legitimate art form, with similarities to other respected art forms such as painting, architecture, and music.
  The passage also suggests that perfumery can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes, and that a talented perfumer can create an imaginary world as powerful and intimate as that of a great composer or painter.
  However, the passage does not suggest that some forms of art are superior to others, that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for commercial success, or that the best works of art improve with age.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfume-making, and argues that perfumers are in the same business as artists who create the illusion of life on canvas. The passage also suggests that the undervaluation of great perfumes may be due to the influence of large corporations that prioritize profits over quality.

Thought: The passage provides support for the idea that a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes. The passage suggests that perfumers create imaginary worlds that can evoke memories or long-forgotten experiences, and that this is similar to the way that artists create the illusion of life on canvas. The passage also suggests that a talented perfumer can create combinations of olfactory elements that produce small sensations, similar to the way that painters combine pigments to create harmonious combinations of color.

Criticism: The passage does not provide support for the idea that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success, nor does it suggest that the best works of art improve with age. The passage also does not suggest that some forms of art are superior to others.

  The combinations of olfactory elements in perfumes change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the art of perfumery is similar to the art of painting in that both involve the combination of many small sensations to create an aesthetic experience.
  Perfumes, like paintings, can bring about memories and emotions.
  The passage does not suggest that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success, or that the best works of art improve with age.
  The passage does not make any value judgments about the superiority of one form of art over another.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.
  D: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he condueted.
  E: Though he composed and condueted primarily jazz, he also composed some music of other genres.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use
  D: detectable using brain scans enhanced by means of the subtractive method

The passage discusses the subtractive method used to interpret brain scans, which produces a false impression of neat functional localization by subtracting out all distributed brain functions. The passage does not suggest that Uttal's critique of the modular theory of mind is invalid or that mental processes are independent modules based in different areas of the brain.

  Psychologist William Uttal is mentioned in the passage.
  A: The answer choice claims that the various mental processes are independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain.
  B: The answer choice claims that the various mental processes are essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason.
  C: The answer choice claims that the various mental processes are generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use.
  D: The answer choice claims that the various mental processes are detectable using brain scans enhanced by means of the subtractive method.
  E: The answer choice claims that the various mental processes are features of a general mental activity that is spread throughout the brain.
Thought: 
  The passage states that William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. Therefore, the answer is E: features of a general mental activity that is spread throughout the brain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Psychologist William Uttal is mentioned as a critic of the modular theory of mind.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise on which neuroimaging in psychology is based.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: According to the passage, which one of the following was true of the physics community during the 1930s?
Choices:
  A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: It reevaluated caleulations indicating that atoms could be split
  C: It never identified the by-products ofneutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  D: It showed that uraniwn atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: It recogoized the daogers of working with radioactive substances.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses advances in scientific understanding related to the splitting of atoms, specifically uranium.
  Italian physicists, including Enrico Fermi, first bombarded uranium with neutrons in 1934.
  Experiments related to neutron bombardment of uranium produced a group of radioactive substances that remained unidentified for some time.
  In 1939, Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that enabled scientists to recognize that they had achieved nuclear fission.
Thought:
  The physics community during the 1930s was focused on experiments related to neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Earlier theoretical developments related to the possibility of splitting atoms were not initially recognized as relevant to these experiments.
  Scientists compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Meitner's theoretical connection was crucial in enabling scientists to understand that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Therefore, the community neglected earlier theoretical developments related to splitting atoms.
  The answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.

  C: The passage mentions that the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium were initially unidentified, but later recognized as elements.
  D: The passage does not state that uranium atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: The passage mentions the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but does not indicate whether or not the physics community recognized these dangers.
Thought: 
  The passage describes the physics community's gradual realization of the possibility of nuclear fission, culminating in Lise Meitner's recognition of the significance of the data. While the community did not initially recognize the by-products of neutron bombardment as elements resulting from the splitting of atoms, they eventually came to realize this through their experimentation. However, the passage does not mention whether or not the community recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: It never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism: 
  The passage does mention that the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium were initially unidentified, but this does not necessarily mean that the physics community never identified them. It is possible that some individuals or groups within the community did identify the by-products, but the community as a whole did not recognize their significance until later.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Which one of the following is most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" (line 62)?
Choices:
  A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939
  B: the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938
  C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium
  D: the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus
  E: the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The author refers to "the relevant evidence" in line 62.
Thought:
  The relevant evidence must be something that was present for some time but lacking the right conceptual link.
  The author mentions Meitner's research and Hahn's discovery of barium as significant to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The evidence must be related to these findings.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence is the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, which provided increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Choice A is the most accurate and equivalent to the author's meaning.
Criticism: 
  There is some support for choice C since the clear chemical evidence of barium's being produced was a crucial piece of the puzzle.
  However, the passage suggests that the relevant evidence includes the results of experiments conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, which provided increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Therefore, choice A is a more accurate and complete answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, which occurred between 1934 and 1939.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
  Researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians and discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Researchers were not receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission happening in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments.
Thought: 
  The author refers to "the relevant evidence" as something that was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The discovery of nuclear fission was the result of neutron-bombardment experiments.
  The passage mentions several experiments and discoveries related to neutron bombardment of uranium, but only one of them (line 57-58) is referred to as "surprising" and "went against all previous experiences of nuclear physics" - the conclusive identification of barium as one of the substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Meitner recognized the significance of this discovery and coined the term "nuclear fission".
  Therefore, "the relevant evidence" in this context is the clear chemical evidence of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism: 
  Your interpretation of the passage is correct.
  The evidence of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium was the crucial discovery that led to the recognition of nuclear fission.

Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the discovery of nuclear fission and the history of the experiments leading up to its recognition.
  The author notes that the relevant evidence for the discovery of nuclear fission had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Thought:
  The "relevant evidence" mentioned in line 62 must be the data that provided the missing link connecting the experimental results to the concept of nuclear fission.
  Option A describes the experiments conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, which provided increasing evidence of nuclear fission but did not recognize it as such until Meitner's theoretical connection.
  Option B describes Meitner's related research in 1938, which contributed to the discovery but is not the missing link referred to by the author.
  Option C describes the clear chemical evidence found by Hahn of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, which was a crucial piece of evidence but not the missing link referred to by the author.
  Option D describes the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus, which was another crucial piece of evidence but not the missing link referred to by the author.
  Option E describes the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for a long time, which is not equivalent to the relevant evidence referred to by the author.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, which was a crucial piece of evidence but was not recognized as such until Meitner provided the missing conceptual link. 
Action: Answer("C")

Thought:
  The relevant evidence is something that the researchers had but did not recognize until the right conceptual link was made.
  The right conceptual link was made by Meitner who recognized that the results were evidence of splitting uranium atoms.
  The relevant evidence is likely to be the same evidence that Meitner used to make the conceptual link.
  Hahn's discovery of barium as one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium is the turning point in recognizing nuclear fission.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The discovery was made after a series of experiments on neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Theoretical physicists had previously suggested the possibility of breaking apart atoms.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, recognizing that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
Thought:
  The "relevant evidence" that was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link refers to the evidence that uranium atoms were being split.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, the answer is D: the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus.
Criticism:
  It could be argued that the other options also represent relevant evidence in the discovery of nuclear fission.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?

  Lichtenstein merged popular genres with the forms and intentions of fine art.
  Pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism.
  Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a complex result of merging a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art, displaying an impulse toward realism, and exuding a kind of deliberate naivete.
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  A: If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  B: If Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  C: If Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  D: If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  E: If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion, it would challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein because Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism and exuded a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists.

  Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.
  Lichtenstein's persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism and true feeling.
  None of the options directly contradict these characterizations.
  However, option B suggests that Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an emotional painting, which could imply that Lichtenstein was not rebelling against the emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Therefore, option B could challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a complex result of merging a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art, conveying a seriousness of theme while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, and displaying an impulse toward realism.
Thought:
  The question asks which of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 
  A: The fact that Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s is not directly relevant to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work, and does not seem to contradict it.
  B: The fact that Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting does not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work, as Lichtenstein's work is not characterized as being anti-emotional or devoid of emotion.
  C: The fact that Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings also does not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work, for the same reason as option B.
  D: The fact that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings is not directly relevant to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's own work, and does not seem to contradict it.
  E: The fact that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion does challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work, as the author describes Lichtenstein's work as displaying an impulse toward realism and exuding an inner sweetness, which suggests that his work is not devoid of emotion. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum
  C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should allow trading based on information that is not exclusive to insiders.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading should be illegal because it undermines transparency in the market and harms investor confidence. 
Thought: 
  The author of passage A argues that the stock market operates best when all relevant information is spread widely and quickly. 
  The author believes that insider-trading laws should permit trading based on information that is not exclusive to insiders because such actions help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. 
  Option A is not consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage A because it would prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone. 
  Option B is consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage A because it permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Option C is not consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage A because it would prohibit trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which includes trading based on information that is not exclusive to insiders. 
  Option D is not consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage A because it would legalize selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising. The author of passage A does not make any distinction between buying and selling based on insider information.
  Option E is not consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage A because it would legalize trading based on inside information, which is precisely what the author argues against.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread widely and quickly, and insider trading can help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. 
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the principle of transparency and creates an uneven playing field that could ultimately destroy the market.
Thought:
  The author of Passage A argues that insider trading can serve a useful purpose in ensuring that stock prices reflect accurate assessments of all relevant facts, but is not advocating for a completely unrestricted market. 
  The author of Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the basic principle of transparency and creates an uneven playing field that could ultimately destroy the market.
  Therefore, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of Passage A but not that articulated by the author of Passage B would be one that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  The answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism:
  It is possible that certain types of analysis of a stock could still give an individual an unfair advantage over others who do not have access to that information, even if that information is not obtained through insider trading. 
  However, given the arguments made in the two passages, B is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Passage A argues that insider trading laws should permit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, as long as it is obtained through legal means. The author argues that this helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts and is good for everyone in the stock market. Passage B argues that insider trading compromises the market and undermines investor confidence, and that a transparent market, where everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, is necessary for success. 

Therefore, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This is because passage A argues that trading based on legal, non-public information obtained through analysis of a stock should be permitted, while passage B argues that insider trading in any form compromises the market and undermines investor confidence.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider trading can help ensure that stock prices reflect accurate assessments of a company's value because it spreads knowledge that affects stock prices.
  Passage A suggests that insider nontrading is a much more widespread practice than insider trading and argues that it is rightly permitted.
  Passage B argues that insider trading compromises the market's transparency and undermines investor confidence.
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading can be beneficial to the market if it helps spread knowledge about a company's value.
  Passage A suggests that insider nontrading is a more widespread practice and should be permitted.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the market's transparency and investor confidence.
  Therefore, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would be one that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Choice B permits trading based on analysis of a stock and prohibits trading based on insider information, which aligns with the argument made in passage A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, but should only prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should permit selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping, but does not mention anything about buying based on inside information that it should be rising.
  Passage A argues that people who have accurate information about changing circumstances should be permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them, which helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that insider trading unfairly compromises the stock market and undermines investor confidence, which could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Thought:
  The author of Passage A argues that insider trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, but should only prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
  Choice A prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which is contrary to the author's position in Passage A.
  Choice B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is consistent with the author's position in Passage A.
  Choice C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which is not specific enough to conform closely to the author's position in either passage.
  Choice D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is not mentioned in Passage A.
  Choice E legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means, which is contrary to the author's position in Passage A.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is consistent with the author's position in Passage A. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that is available to everyone, but only trading based on information that is not available to the public.
  Passage A suggests that insider nontrading is a widespread practice that should not be punished.
  Passage B argues that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market and that insider trading unfairly compromises the market.
  Passage B suggests that investor confidence is necessary for the stock market to function.
Thought:
  The author of passage A argues that insider trading laws should only prohibit trading based on information that is not available to the public, and that insider nontrading should not be punished.
  The author of passage B argues that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market and that insider trading unfairly compromises the market.
  The law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would be one that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone but permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock.
  Choice A is too broad because it would prohibit all trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, including information that is gained through analysis.
  Choice B is similar to the law suggested by the author of passage A, but it does not address insider nontrading.
  Choice C is too vague because it does not specify what types of trading could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence.
  Choice D is too specific because it only addresses buying and selling based on inside information related to the direction of the stock price.
  Choice E contradicts the position of both authors by legalizing trading based on inside information.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Criticism:
  The author of passage A argues that insider nontrading should not be punished but the law suggested by Choice B does not address that issue.

  Passage A argues that insider trading should be legal because it is a part of a functioning stock market, and trading based on non-public information is necessary for the market to work efficiently.
  Passage B argues that insider trading should be illegal because it is unfair and undermines the transparency of the stock market.
Thought:
  The author of passage A believes that insider trading should be legal, but only if the information used for trading is not obtained from one's position within a company (as this would be considered insider trading).
  The author of passage A also believes that trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market should not be allowed.
  The author of passage B believes that insider trading, in general, should be illegal because it is unfair and undermines the transparency of the stock market.
  Therefore, the law that most closely conforms to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would be a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  The answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism:
  The answer could also be C because the author of passage A argues that trading that undermines investors' confidence in the stock market should not be allowed, which is similar to the position in passage B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law is problematic because it prevents accurate information from being reflected in stock prices, which harms investors and the stock market as a whole. It suggests that insider trading is not inherently problematic, but rather that the real issue is the lack of transparency in the market. The author argues that insider non-trading, which involves not making a transaction based on inside knowledge, is just as problematic as insider trading.
  Passage B argues that transparency is a fundamental principle of the stock market and that insider trading undermines this principle by giving some investors an unfair advantage. This harms the market as a whole by eroding investor confidence and making it difficult for people to make money in the market. The author argues that the purpose of the stock market is to enable people to make money through good investing decisions.
Thought:
  Passage A argues that it is problematic for insider-trading law to prohibit trading based on non-public information. Rather, what is needed is greater transparency in the market so that everyone has access to the same information. Therefore, the law that conforms most closely to the position articulated in passage A but not passage B would be one that promotes transparency and prohibits actions that undermine it. 
  Choice A prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone. This is consistent with passage B's argument that transparency is important but does not align with passage A's argument that insider trading can be beneficial if all investors have access to the same information.
  Choice B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This is consistent with the argument made in both passages that insider trading is problematic but does not align with passage A's suggestion that insider trading can be beneficial if all investors have access to the same information.
  Choice C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market. This aligns with the argument made in both passages that investor confidence is important, but it does not address the issue of transparency raised in passage A.
  Choice D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising. This does not align with either passage's arguments about the importance of transparency and the potential benefits of insider trading.
  Choice E legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means. This aligns with the argument made in passage A that insider trading can be beneficial if all investors have access to the same information, but it does not address the issue of transparency raised in that passage.
Criticism:
  Upon further consideration, it is possible that choice C aligns more closely with the argument made in passage A than initially thought. Passage A argues that accurate information is necessary to ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. Choice C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which could include actions that distort the accuracy of stock prices. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit trading based on information that everyone doesn't have access to if it is not obtained from one's position within a company, as it is important for the stock market to reflect accurate assessments of all the relevant facts. 
  Passage B argues that insider-trading compromises the transparency of the stock market and undermines investor confidence, which could ultimately destroy the market.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that trading based on information that everyone doesn't have access to should be permitted, as long as it is not obtained from one's position within a company. 
  Option A prohibits all trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which is not in line with the author's argument. 
  Option B permits trading based on analysis of a stock, which is in line with the author's argument, but it also prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is not. 
  Option C prohibits trading that could undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which is in line with the argument in Passage B. 
  Option D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising. This is not in line with the author's argument in Passage A. 
  Option E legalizes trading based on inside information, which is not in line with either author's argument. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Criticism: 
  There is no significant criticism of this answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should allow trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, but should prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading laws should prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, and that such trading undermines investor confidence in the stock market.
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
  However, it should prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Therefore, choice B is the closest to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two theories about how communication between neurons occurs: the electrical signal theory and the chemical signal theory.
  The chemical signal theory is gradually gaining acceptance in the scientific community.
  The mechanism by which neurotransmitters render the receiving neuron permeable to ions was not well understood for a long time, but recent research has provided a convincing explanation.
  Receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  The opening of the channel component is triggered by the attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site, causing the receptor to change shape.
  Neurotransmitter-gated ion channels constitute a family of receptors with several varieties, and each variety has slightly different properties.
  These differences may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.
Thought:
  The passage discusses two theories about how communication between neurons occurs, and explains how the chemical signal theory is supported by recent research.
  The passage also explains the mechanism by which neurotransmitters render the receiving neuron permeable to ions, and how receptors for neurotransmitters are structured.
  Finally, the passage discusses how the existence of several varieties of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that recent evidence supports the chemical signal theory of communication between neurons, which is facilitated by the structure of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, and that the existence of several varieties of these channels may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the two theories of how neurons communicate: electrically and chemically.
  The chemical theory suggests that neurotransmitters are secreted by neurons and bind to receptors on receiving neurons, rendering them permeable to ions, which generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell.

Thought:
  The passage is mainly about the discovery of the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions, as well as the discovery of differences among receptor molecules in the brain which raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  The passage describes the history of two theories regarding communication between neurons, but this is not the main point of the passage.
  The passage also explains that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family, but this is not the main point of the passage either.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the development of a theory about how neurons communicate, as well as recent evidence that supports this theory.
  The theory proposes that communication between neurons occurs chemically, rather than electrically, through the use of neurotransmitters.
  The passage explains how the binding of a neurotransmitter to a receptor molecule on a receiving neuron can cause the neuron to become permeable to ions, allowing an electrical impulse to be generated and transmitted to the next neuron.
  The passage also notes that researchers have discovered that the structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in this process, and that there are several types of receptors that conform to this structure.
Thought:
  The main point of the passage is to explain the theory of neurotransmission and the evidence that supports it, as well as the medical significance of this evidence.
  The passage emphasizes that communication between neurons occurs chemically, through the use of neurotransmitters, rather than electrically.
  The passage also notes that the structure of receptors is important in this process, and that there are several types of receptors that conform to this structure.
  Additionally, the passage explains that there are subtle differences among the receptors for different neurotransmitters, and that this may allow for selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  Based on this, the best answer is D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders. 
Criticism:
  The other answer choices either incorrectly state that the brain is guided exclusively by chemicals, or they do not mention the medical significance of the evidence presented in the passage.
  However, it could be argued that the passage's main point is more focused on the discovery of the structure of receptors and how this relates to the process of neurotransmission, rather than the medical significance of this discovery.
  In which case, answer choice B could also be considered correct.
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of a new type of pathogen called a prion that is responsible for causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  CJD is a degenerative form of dementia that causes nerve cell death in the brain.
  Prions lack nucleic acid and consist mainly of protein.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain.
  The abnormal conformation of prions induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
Thought: 
  The passage provides a lot of information about prions and their role in CJD.
  It is clear that prions are a new type of pathogen that lack nucleic acid and consist mainly of protein.
  The passage also describes the mechanism by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction.
  However, the passage does not support any of the options directly.
  Option A is incorrect because the passage does not state that the only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  Option B is incorrect because the passage does not state that most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  Option C is correct because the passage describes how prions are only able to cause an infection if they are able to reproduce themselves.
  Option D is incorrect because the passage does not state that Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  Option E is incorrect because the passage does not provide enough information to determine whether prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide enough information to determine whether Option E is correct or not.
  The passage also does not provide any information to support Options A or B.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen responsible for CJD.
  CJD is a degenerative form of dementia in humans that causes nerve cell death.
  Prions lack nucleic acid and reproduce themselves by converting normally shaped prions into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions are naturally occurring proteins in the body and do not produce an immune response.
Thought:
  The passage supports the idea that prions are a new type of infectious pathogen.
  Prions cause CJD by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  There is no discussion of other infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens now being thought to be caused by prions.
  The passage suggests that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological diseases, but it does not state that Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  There is no discussion of the progression of prion diseases compared to diseases caused by other known pathogens.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  CJD is a degenerative form of dementia that causes brain damage and nerve cell death.
  Until recently, it was widely assumed that all pathogens contain genetic material in their cellular structure.
  Prions are a type of protein pathogen that lack nucleic acid and reproduce by inducing normally shaped prions to transform themselves into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins and do not produce an immune response when present.
  The discovery of prions and their link to CJD has been supported by subsequent research.
Thought:
  Abnormally shaped prions cause CJD by inducing normally shaped prions to transform themselves into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions can reproduce themselves in this way because they lack nucleic acid.
  If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Criticism:
  None of the other answer choices are supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  CJD is caused by a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein, which scientists have called "prion".
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain.
  Prions possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape and reproducing themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties.
  Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions as an entirely new class of infectious pathogens that cause CJD.
  Prions possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape and reproducing themselves in an unexpected way.
  Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties.
  Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
  Therefore, C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD is most strongly supported by the passage.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not discuss the transmission of CJD through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  The passage does not suggest that other infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  The passage does not state that Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  The passage does not compare the progression of prion diseases to diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions as a new type of protein pathogen responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  Prions are infectious agents consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein and lacking nucleic acid.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues but can transform into a dangerous, abnormal shape.
  The abnormal prions have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact.
  This cascade of transformations produces a plaque that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.
Thought: 
  The passage provides strong evidence for the idea that prions are a new type of infectious pathogen.
  It describes how prions are different from other pathogens in that they consist mainly of protein and reproduce themselves by inducing normally shaped prions to transform into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  The passage also describes how the abnormal prions cause cellular destruction and ultimately lead to the death of the infected individual.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported idea by the passage is that if abnormally shaped prions were unable to reproduce themselves, they would not cause CJD.
  The passage does not provide any evidence to support the other choices.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")

Thought: 
  The passage states that prions can reproduce themselves by converting normally shaped prions into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  It also notes that prions exhibit infectious properties and can reproduce themselves even though they lack nucleic acid.
  Therefore, the ability to reproduce themselves is a necessary condition for abnormally shaped prions to cause CJD.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
The main point of the passage is that for a long time economists failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries, and that the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing, is necessary for the idea of the invisible hand to work properly. The passage also explains why the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, and why it was hard for increasing returns to be represented mathematically. Therefore, the best answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Answer: E
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a contradiction in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory represents increasing returns to scale, which can lead to monopolies.
  The Invisible Hand represents the idea that self-interest can lead to the common good in a competitive market.
  Diminishing returns to scale were assumed to be the norm and were easier to represent mathematically.
  Recent developments have allowed increasing returns to be modeled more rigorously.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is to discuss the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, and how previous assumptions about returns to scale have affected economic theory.
  The passage does not argue that mainstream economists have always assumed increasing returns to scale (A).
  While the passage does state that the mathematical rigor of diminishing returns has made it easier to accept the Invisible Hand (B), this is not the main point of the passage.
  The passage does not argue that recent developments have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously than the Invisible Hand (C).
  The passage does discuss Adam Smith and the Invisible Hand (D), but this is not the main point of the passage.
  The main point of the passage is that economists have, until recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries (E).
Criticism: 
  The passage does not state that economists have "failed" to account for increasing returns, but rather that they have had difficulty representing them mathematically.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a contradiction in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand relies on the assumption of diminishing returns.
  Increasing returns can lead to monopoly power, while diminishing returns assume many competitors in each industry.
  Many economists in the past were unable to describe the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is that there has been a historical struggle in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  While Adam Smith's Invisible Hand theory has been widely accepted, the Pin Factory concept has been largely ignored due to its difficulty in being mathematically modeled.
  Recent developments in mathematics have enabled economists to better understand the Pin Factory.
  The passage emphasizes that the assumption of diminishing returns has been the dominant economic theory for almost two centuries.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage discusses the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  However, the passage does not emphasize recent developments in mathematics enabling the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  Instead, the passage discusses the historical preference for diminishing returns and the recent recognition of the importance of increasing returns.
  Therefore, the answer is not C.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
The main point of the passage is that the traditional assumption in economic theory that returns to scale are diminishing has been challenged by the idea of increasing returns to scale exemplified by the Pin Factory. The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the concept of the Invisible Hand, which is central to Adam Smith's economic theory. While the Pin Factory demonstrates how increasing returns to scale lead to natural monopolies, the Invisible Hand relies on the notion of many competitors in each industry to ensure that nobody can exert monopoly power. The passage explains that until recently, economists failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries because it was challenging to represent their ideas mathematically. Therefore, the correct answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 

Action: Answer("E")

Answer: E
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  Adam Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size and how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes increasing returns to scale, which can lead to natural tendencies toward monopoly if not checked by competition.
  Diminishing returns to scale have been the dominant assumption in economic theory, as they are easier to represent mathematically.
  Recent developments in mathematics have allowed for the Pin Factory to be more rigorously modeled.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand and how this is a problem in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes increasing returns to scale, which can lead to natural tendencies toward monopoly if not checked by competition.
  Diminishing returns to scale have been the dominant assumption in economic theory, as they are easier to represent mathematically.
  The Invisible Hand relies on competition to balance out the natural tendencies toward monopoly, which requires many competitors in each industry.
  Recent developments in mathematics have allowed for the Pin Factory to be more rigorously modeled, but this is not the main point of the passage.
  The main point is that the Pin Factory has been historically neglected in economic theory due to the difficulty of representing it mathematically, until recent developments made it more respectable.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not state that mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing (A).
  The functioning of the Invisible Hand is discussed, but the main point is not that its acceptance is due to the mathematical rigor of diminishing returns (B).
  The passage does not state that recent developments have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously than the Invisible Hand (C).
  The passage discusses Adam Smith's ideas, but his understanding of how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good is not the main point (D).
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
The main point of the passage is that there has been a struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory, with the former emphasizing increasing returns to scale and the latter relying on diminishing returns to scale. The Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand are opposed to each other, as increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration, which was a period between 1915 and 1960 during which around 40 percent of the African American population in the Southern United States migrated to the North.
  The Great Migration was triggered by several factors, including increased labor demand in the North due to World War I, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and labor agents recruiting African American laborers in the South.
  The difficulties and costs of migration include uncertainty about housing and labor-market conditions, the physical cost of moving, and the need to familiarize oneself with local labor- and housing-market institutions.
  Early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip, and they helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the factors that contributed to the Great Migration.
  It also explains how previous migrants reduced the physical costs of moving and provided a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that previous migrants played an important role in the Great Migration by reducing the costs and difficulties of migration for later migrants.
  The answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Criticism: 
  The passage does discuss the factors that contributed to the Great Migration, such as increased labor demand in the North and reduced labor demand in the South.
  However, the focus of the passage is on the role of previous migrants in reducing the costs and difficulties of migration for later migrants.
  Therefore, while option B is partially correct, it does not accurately express the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
The main point of the passage is that "in migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants." This is most accurately expressed in choice D: "In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants."
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by multiple factors, including increased labor demand in the North due to World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  Once the Great Migration began, earlier migrants helped reduce the physical and financial costs for later migrants and provided a cultural cushion.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the North and the factors that triggered and sustained the migration.
  The passage highlights the role of earlier migrants in reducing the costs and difficulties of migration for later migrants.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that earlier migrants played a significant role in sustaining the Great Migration over several decades.
  The answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Criticism: 
  The passage does discuss the factors that triggered and sustained the Great Migration, including increased labor demand in the North and reduced labor demand in the South.
  However, the passage focuses more on the role of earlier migrants in sustaining the migration.
  While E is a possible answer, it is not the most accurate because the passage does address the factors that sustained the Great Migration, but it does so in the context of the role of earlier migrants.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by several factors, including increased labor demand in the North during World War I, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and the recruitment efforts of Northern employers.
  Once the Great Migration started, it continued and even accelerated over time.
  This was due in part to the fact that earlier migrants reduced the costs and difficulties of migration for later migrants by providing information, temporary housing, and cultural support.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by several factors, including increased labor demand in the North and reduced labor demand in the South.
  Once the Great Migration started, it continued and even accelerated over time.
  This was due in part to the fact that earlier migrants reduced the costs and difficulties of migration for later migrants by providing information, temporary housing, and cultural support.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the Great Migration was triggered by multiple factors, but once it started, it continued and accelerated due to the support provided by earlier migrants.
  This is best expressed by answer choice D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Criticism: 
  Answer choice A is too narrow. While it is true that the passage discusses the Great Migration, this choice does not capture the full complexity of the factors that contributed to it or the support provided by earlier migrants.
  Answer choice B is partially correct, but it focuses too much on the initial triggers of the Great Migration and does not address the role of earlier migrants in supporting later migrants.
  Answer choice C is partially correct, but it focuses too narrowly on the financial costs of migration and does not fully capture the range of support provided by earlier migrants.
  Answer choice E is too broad. While it is true that there were other factors that contributed to the duration of the Great Migration, this choice does not capture the central role played by earlier migrants in supporting later migrants.

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The migration was triggered by increased labor demand in the North due to World War I, a boll weevil infestation in the South, and Northern employers recruiting African American labor in the South.
  Once the migration had begun, it developed momentum over time as earlier migrants reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration for later migrants.

  Once the migration had begun, it developed momentum over time as earlier migrants reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration for later migrants.
  The main point of the passage is that the Great Migration was initially triggered by economic factors, but its duration and acceleration was due to the role of earlier migrants in reducing the cost and difficulty of migration for later migrants.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Criticism: 
  The answer is correct in stating that the passage discusses the role of earlier migrants in reducing the cost and difficulty of migration for later migrants.
  However, the answer doesn't reflect the fact that the Great Migration was initially triggered by economic factors, specifically increased labor demand in the North due to World War I and a boll weevil infestation in the South.
  So, the answer could be improved by including this information.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")

The main point of the passage is to describe the factors that led to the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915 and 1960 and to explain why migration continued and even accelerated in subsequent decades. The passage argues that once migration started, it developed momentum over time as current migration reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration. The passage goes on to describe the various hindrances to migration, including uncertainty about housing and labor-market conditions in the destination, the cost of physically moving, and the need to adapt to a new culture or language. The passage shows how earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants by reducing physical costs, providing temporary housing, food, and credit, and providing a cultural and linguistic cushion. Therefore, the best choice is D.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration, which occurred between 1915 and 1960, during which roughly 40% of the African American population left the Southern United States for the industrial cities of the North. 
  The Great Migration was triggered by increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I, a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and Northern employers sending labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South.
  Once migration started, it developed momentum over time as current migration reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration.
  Early migrants provided information about labor and housing-market conditions and reduced the physical costs of moving and provided a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration and its triggers, but the main point seems to be about how migration movements work.
  The passage highlights how previous migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  This explains why African American migration to the North continued and accelerated even as income differences between the North and South were narrowing.
  Therefore, the main point seems to be that in migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  The answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Criticism: 
  This seems to be the main point of the passage, but it is a bit more general than the passage's focus on the Great Migration.
  However, the passage does highlight the specific ways in which earlier migrants helped later migrants during the Great Migration, so it is still a reasonable answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial cities of the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by several factors, including increased labor demand in the North due to World War I, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and labor agents recruiting African American labor in the South.
  Once the Great Migration started, it developed momentum over time as earlier migrants helped reduce the difficulty and cost of future migration for later migrants.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: indicate why previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided
  B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events
  C: challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915
  D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain
  E: suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained

The authors propose that previous migrant support reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration, which led to momentum over time. 
  Therefore, the primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
  The answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that the last sentence of the second paragraph challenges previous research on the Great Migration or that it extends the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events. 
  Nor does it suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial North from 1915 to 1960.
  The passage provides several reasons for the start of the Great Migration, including increased labor demand in the North due to World War I and a boll weevil infestation that reduced labor demand in the South.
  The passage suggests that once the Great Migration started, it developed momentum over time due to reduced difficulty and cost of future migration, as well as information and support provided by earlier migrants.
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph begins with "Additionally," which suggests that it will provide additional information related to the previous sentence.
  The sentence discusses how previous migrants provided support and information to later migrants, which is related to the discussion of how the Great Migration developed momentum over time.
  Therefore, the purpose of the sentence is to provide additional evidence for the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration.
  The answer is B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that the purpose of the sentence is to challenge traditional views or indicate that previous research is misguided.
  The sentence does not present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain; rather, it explains how earlier migrants provided support and information to later migrants.
  The sentence does not suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North in the United States between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was caused by several factors, including labor demand in the North and a boll weevil infestation in the South.
  Economists typically assume that people migrate if the expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration.
  Previous migrants reduced the cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing temporary housing, food, and credit, as well as a cultural cushion.
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states that previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then-new surroundings. 
  This sentence seems to be providing a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain, rather than challenging previous research or extending the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration.
  Therefore, the answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the last sentence of the second paragraph presents a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
  However, it also serves to introduce the idea that previous migrants reduced the cost of adapting to a new locale and culture for later migrants, which is an important point for the rest of the passage.
  So, a more complete answer might be D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain and introduce the idea of how previous migrants reduced the cost of adapting to a new locale and culture.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

  Therefore, the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is analogous to the relationship between automobiles and mechanical components such as engines and transmissions (which are required for running) and features such as paint and taillights (which give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but are not required for running).
  The answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism:
  The analogy between plants and their primary and secondary substances and automobiles and their mechanical components and features is not very precise.
  While primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning in all plants, mechanical components are not required in all automobiles (some may run on electricity).
  Similarly, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, features such as paint and taillights are not directly related to the operation of the car.

  Secondary substances are diverse chemicals that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Therefore, it can be said that the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is analogous to the relationship between automobiles and their mechanical components (which are required for them to run) and their features (which give them their distinctive look and serve other functions, but are not required for them to run).
  The answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between plants and their primary and secondary substances and automobiles and their mechanical components and features is not completely accurate.
  While it is true that primary substances are required for the growth and proper functioning of all plants and that secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, the same cannot be said for mechanical components and features of automobiles.
  Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are required for automobiles to run, but features such as paint and taillights do not give a car its distinctive look and are not necessary for it to run.
  Therefore, while B may seem like the best answer, it is not a very accurate analogy.

  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances arose from genetic mutations in individual plants and are conserved by natural selection.
  Insects play a major role in plants' having the secondary substances they have today.
Thought:
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and are not necessary for growth and proper functioning.
  Therefore, the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is most closely analogous to the relationship between automobiles and their mechanical components such as engines and transmissions, which are necessary for the car to run, and features such as paint and taillights, which give the car its distinctive look but are not necessary for it to run.
  The answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism:
  The analogy between plants and their primary and secondary substances and automobiles and their mechanical components and features is not perfect.
  While both primary substances and mechanical components are necessary for growth and functioning, primary substances are found in all plants, while mechanical components are not found in all automobiles.
  Additionally, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, features such as paint and taillights do not give automobiles distinctive tastes and smells.
  However, of the given choices, B is the option that most closely resembles the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
Thought:
  Primary and secondary substances are both found in plants.
  Primary substances are necessary for the growth and proper functioning of plants.
  Secondary substances are not necessary for the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism, but they give plants their distinct tastes and smells.
  Therefore, the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is most closely analogous to the relationship between automobiles and their mechanical components and features.
  Automobiles require mechanical components such as engines and transmissions to run properly, but features such as paint and taillights are not necessary for the functioning of the car, although they do serve other functions.
  Similarly, plants require primary substances for their growth and functioning, but secondary substances are not necessary for their internal chemical processes, although they do give the plants distinct tastes and smells.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
Choices:
  A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  D: Most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  E: Dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the pioneering work of Katherine Dunham in the field of dance ethnology in the 1930s.

  The passage states that "most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry." (lines 16-19)
  The passage also states that "no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research." (lines 19-22)
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the peers mentioned in line 22 would have likely agreed with a statement that suggests dance was not seen as a legitimate area of scientific inquiry in the past.
  Among the answer choices, the statement that best reflects this view is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism: 
  While it is true that social scientists did not view dance as a legitimate area of scientific inquiry in the past, the statement in choice B does not fully capture this view.
  In fact, the passage suggests that social scientists were not well versed in dance traditions and that this lack of expertise made it difficult for them to obtain reliable data about dance as a cultural form.
  Therefore, choice B is not the best answer.

  The peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
  The passage suggests that previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists did not have the necessary training in dance, and experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research.
  The passage also suggests that colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances and because they subscribed to the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with statement B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham, an African American choreographer, and her contributions to the incorporation of traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into North American and European choreography. 
  Dunham was also an anthropologist in the 1930s and conducted research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms. 
  Her approach to research diverged from the prevailing methodology at that time, as she participated in the dances herself rather than observing from a position of complete detachment. 
  Dunham used her research-to-performance method to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. 
Thought: 
  The question asks which statement about the study of dance would have been most likely to be agreed upon by Dunham's peers in anthropology. 
  The passage mentions that most social scientists at that time gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized as scientifically rigorous and legitimate. 
  The passage also states that experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. 
  Therefore, it is likely that Dunham's peers in anthropology would agree with a statement that suggests dance was not considered a legitimate area of social research at that time. 
  The closest statement to this is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. 
  This statement implies that social scientists did not consider it necessary to have knowledge of dance traditions in order to conduct research on them, which could be seen as a dismissal of dance as a legitimate area of social research. 
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide enough information to definitively support any of the answer choices. 
  While it is mentioned that dance had been neglected as an area of social research and that experts in dance were not trained in social research methods, it is not clear which specific statement Dunham's peers in anthropology would have agreed with. 
  Additionally, answer choice B may not accurately reflect the prevailing beliefs of Dunham's peers, as it suggests that social scientists did not consider knowledge of dance traditions necessary for research, rather than implying a dismissal of dance as a legitimate area of social research. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the work of Katherine Dunham, an African American choreographer who introduced the dance-isolation technique to North American and European choreography. 
  Dunham's success was due in part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  Dunham conducted research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms in the 1930s, with a special interest in their origins in African culture.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that Dunham's colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  This advice was based on the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment, which was the prevailing view at the time.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dunham's peers would have been most likely to agree with the statement that "research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision" (choice C).
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's success in introducing traditional dance techniques into mainstream North American dance through her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  The passage notes that dance had been neglected as an area of social research due to the lack of trained experts in both dance and social research.
  The passage suggests that Dunham's success was due in part to her approach to research, which involved participating in the dances herself.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Dunham's approach to research was divergent from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  The passage notes that colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  The colleagues held this view because they subscribed to the long-standing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  The peers mentioned in line 22 would most likely agree with this view.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism: 
  The peers mentioned in line 22 are not explicitly discussed.
  While it is possible that they would agree with the view that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them, there is not enough evidence in the passage to definitively support this answer.

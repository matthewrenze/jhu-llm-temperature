### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B examine the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  Passage A describes two phenomena (habituation and rivalry) that push up the norm of income that people compare to.
  Passage A also discusses how people are happy to be poorer if their relative position improves.
  Passage B suggests that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful, that they have created value.
Thought:
  The authors of Passage A might describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as feeling the "phenomenon of rivalry". The authors suggest that people are happy when they are relatively better off than people they consider most like them. Therefore, the authors might describe this person as "competitive".
  The authors of Passage B suggest that people who want to make more money than their neighbors are not necessarily being egocentric or primitive. Rather, they are driven by a desire to create value. Therefore, the authors might describe this person as "driven".
  The best pair of terms to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors according to Passage A and Passage B, respectively, are "competitive" and "driven".
  The correct answer is not listed.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passages discuss how people's relative position affects their happiness.
  Passage A discusses the phenomena of habituation and rivalry, and how people compare their income to a norm that shifts as their income increases.
  Passage B discusses how earning more money can make people feel successful and create value, leading to happiness.
Thought: 
  The passages do not provide a clear pair of terms to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Passage A mentions the phenomenon of rivalry, where people are happy to be poorer if their relative position improves, and how people compare themselves to their reference group.
  Passage B argues that people use material wealth to show they have created value and feel successful, but it does not provide a specific term to describe someone who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  None of the answer choices seem to fit the discussion in the passages.
  The closest might be "egocentric" (B), but this term is not used in either passage and does not accurately capture the nuanced discussion of relative position and happiness.
Criticism: 
  The question seems to be asking for a specific pair of terms to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  However, the passages do not provide such a pair of terms, and the question does not seem to accurately reflect the content of the passages.
  Therefore, the question may be flawed or poorly worded.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss research regarding the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  Passage A discusses two phenomena that affect how people perceive their wealth: habituation and rivalry.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study mentioned in Passage A found that people are more likely to choose a lower income if it means they are better off than their neighbors.
  Passage B argues that the desire to have more than others is not ignoble, but rather a desire to create value.
Thought:
  Both passages acknowledge that people often compare their wealth to that of their neighbors.
  Passage A notes that people are more likely to choose a lower income if it means they are better off than their neighbors.
  Passage B argues that the desire to have more than others is not ignoble, but rather a desire to create value.
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B would likely use different terms to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  Passage A might describe such a person as "rivalrous", while Passage B might describe such a person as "driven to create value."
  Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The two passages discuss the relationship between income and happiness.
  The authors of passage A refer to the "phenomenon of rivalry" and the importance of relative income.
  The authors of passage B suggest that the desire to create value is a key driver of wanting to earn more.
Thought: 
  The passages do not explicitly use any of the terms listed in the answer choices to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  The passages do suggest that people are motivated by both relative income and the desire to create value.
  Neither passage suggests that the desire to make more money than one's neighbors is either inherently good or inherently bad.
  Therefore, it is not clear which pair of terms the authors would use to describe such a person.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct that neither passage uses any of the terms listed in the answer choices to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  However, it is possible that the authors of the passages would use different pairs of terms to describe such a person.
  Therefore, while it is correct that None of the Above is the best answer, it is not accurate to say that it is impossible to determine which pair of terms the authors would use.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A and B discuss the relationship between income and happiness.
  The authors of Passage A mention the phenomenon of rivalry and how people compare their income to a norm.
  The authors of Passage B argue that people want to create value by earning more money.
Thought:
  Neither passage describes someone who wants to make more money than their neighbors as "altruistic" or "lucky".
  The authors of Passage B argue that wanting to create value by earning more money is admirable, so they are unlikely to describe it as "misguided".
  The authors of Passage B suggest that the desire to earn more money is driven by a desire to create value, so they are unlikely to describe it as "primitive" or "egocentric".
  The authors of Passage A mention the phenomenon of rivalry, which suggests that people who want to make more money than their neighbors may be described as "insular".
  Given this analysis, the most likely answer is A: insular, cosmopolitan.
Criticism:
  It is possible that the authors of Passage A and B would use different terminology to describe someone who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passages discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness, including the role of relative prosperity in determining happiness.
  Passage A discusses the phenomena of habituation and rivalry, which lead to people comparing their income to some norm and wanting to make more money than those around them.
  Passage B argues that wanting to have more than others is evidence of a desire to create value and be successful.
Thought:
  The passages do not use clear pairs of terms to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Passage A uses the terms habituation and rivalry to describe the phenomenon of people comparing their income to some norm and wanting to make more money than those around them, but these terms do not describe a person themselves.
  Passage B argues that wanting to have more than others is evidence of a desire to create value and be successful, which could be described as admirable.
  None of the other answer choices seem to fit with the passages.
  Therefore, the answer is D: misguided, admirable.
Criticism:
  The passages do not use clear pairs of terms to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors, so it is difficult to definitively say that the answer is D.
  However, Passage B does argue that wanting to have more than others is evidence of a desire to create value and be successful, which could be seen as admirable.
  Passage A does describe the phenomenon of rivalry as pushing up the norm for income, but it does not describe people who want to make more money than their neighbors as misguided.
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the chemical composition of plants and the role of secondary substances in giving plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Secondary substances can arise from genetic mutations and are favored by natural selection due to their role in attracting pollinating insects or as biochemical defenses against insect enemies. Insects evolve ways to circumvent plants' defenses and to identify suitable food sources by their characteristic flavors or odors.
  
  A: The passage describes secondary substances as a diverse array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism and give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they signal the presence of nectar to pollinating insects or act as biochemical defenses against insect enemies. 
  B: The passage states that there has been an evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects for hundreds of millions of years. Plants develop defenses against insects, and insects must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. Insects come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they can identify suitable food sources by their characteristic flavors or odors.
  C: The passage does not discuss how insects are able to identify certain plant species, but it does state that species of insects have tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
  D: The passage describes secondary substances as arising from genetic mutations and being conserved by natural selection if they prove to be biochemical defenses against insect enemies. It does not discuss whether these substances have evolved independently in unrelated species of plants.
  E: The passage describes secondary substances as a diverse array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism and give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Some secondary substances are toxic to insects and act as biochemical defenses against insect enemies. There may be some toxic substances that are produced by plants in correlation with secondary substances, but this is not a major focus of the passage.
Thought:
  The passage provides the most support for inferring that secondary substances in plants play an important role in the interaction between plants and insects, serving as biochemical defenses against insect enemies or as signals to attract pollinating insects. These substances can arise from genetic mutations and are conserved by natural selection. Insects evolve ways to circumvent plants' defenses and to identify suitable food sources by their characteristic flavors or odors. 
  Choice A is partially true, but the passage does not suggest that these chemicals are vital to the lives of various kinds of plants.
  Choice B is partially true, but the passage suggests that insects are becoming more specialized in their food sources, not that most plants are used as food by a wide variety of insects.
  Choice C is not supported by the passage.
  Choice D is not supported by the passage.
  Choice E is partially true, but the passage does not focus on the relationship between toxic substances and secondary substances.

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, including primary and secondary substances.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, and can serve as biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects.
  Plant-eating insects must evolve ways to circumvent plant defenses, such as by detoxifying harmful substances or avoiding their effects.
Thought:
  A: The passage discusses secondary substances in plants that have no known role in growth or metabolism, but play a role in the lives of various kinds of plants, including as biochemical defenses against insects. This supports inferring that some chemicals not directly involved in growth or metabolism are vital to some plants.
  B: The passage discusses how insects evolve ways to circumvent plant defenses, but does not provide support for inferring that most plants with chemical defense systems are used as food by a wide variety of insects.
  C: The passage discusses how insects can identify narrowly defined groups of plants by their characteristic flavors or odors, supporting the idea that they use taste and smell to identify plants.
  D: The passage mentions that secondary substances in plants have arisen by mutation and natural selection, and that some of these defenses have evolved independently in unrelated species, but only a few have survived. This supports the idea that many toxic substances have evolved independently in various species, but have only survived in a few.
  E: The passage mentions that some toxic substances produced by plants have evolved in correlation with secondary substances, which suggests that some toxic substances are not secondary substances themselves.
Evaluation:
  A: This is supported by the passage, which discusses the role of secondary substances in plants.
  B: This goes beyond what the passage supports, as it does not provide evidence that most plants with chemical defense systems are used as food by a wide variety of insects.
  C: This is supported by the passage's discussion of how insects identify plants by taste and smell.
  D: This is supported by the passage, which discusses how secondary substances arise through mutation and natural selection, and only a few survive.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which involves a company becoming more efficient and productive as it grows larger.
  A: A publishing house employing fewer editors due to relaxed standards does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: A bee colony using some bees solely to guard its nectar sources to feed a larger colony that can divide up work better illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  C: A school district accommodating more students in a single building by implementing year-round operation does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  D: The lobster industry catching more lobsters a day with the same number of traps due to technology advancements also illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  E: A large ant colony dividing and producing two competing colonies that each grow larger and prosperous enough to divide again and contain more ants than could have existed in one colony, illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Thought: 
  The concept of increasing returns to scale involves a company becoming more efficient and productive as it grows larger.
  One example of increasing returns to scale is a bee colony using some bees solely to guard its nectar sources to feed a larger colony that can divide up work better.
  Another example is the lobster industry catching more lobsters a day with the same number of traps due to technology advancements.
  A large ant colony dividing to create more colonies that are prosperous enough to divide again and contain more ants than could have existed in one colony also illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, one of these three examples must be the best answer.
  A publishing house employing fewer editors due to relaxed standards is not an example of increasing returns to scale and the school district example is not as good of an example as the others.
  Therefore, the best answer is either B, D or E.
Criticism: 
  The bee colony example seems to be the strongest example as it directly relates to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  The lobster industry example also seems to be a good illustration of the concept, but it is less direct.
  The ant colony example illustrates the concept, but it is not as clear-cut as the bee colony example. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains increasing returns to scale and how it is illustrated in the Pin Factory.
  Increasing returns to scale are achieved when the size of the factory increases, and the workers specialize in their tasks, leading to an increase in the production of goods per worker.
  Option A has nothing to do with increasing returns to scale, as it reduces the number of editors.
  Option B is a case of division of labor, allowing bees to specialize in guarding and collecting nectar, but it does not show increasing returns to scale.
  Option C shows how a school district accommodates more students by using the available resources more efficiently, but it does not show increasing returns to scale.
  Option D shows how the lobster industry is able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps due to the technological advancements, but it does not show increasing returns to scale.
Thought:
  Increasing returns to scale are achieved when the size of the factory increases, the workers specialize in their tasks, and the production of goods per worker increases.
  Option E shows how a larger ant colony can divide and produce two competing colonies that each grow and divide into more colonies, ultimately resulting in more ants than could have existed in one colony.
  This division of labor leads to an increase in the production of ants per ant. Therefore, Option E best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the paragraph.
Action: Answer("E")

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  A: The scenario describes a decrease in productivity, not an increase.
  B: The scenario describes how specialization can increase productivity.
  C: The scenario does not discuss specialization or increasing productivity.
  D: The scenario describes an increase in productivity due to advances in technology.
  E: The scenario describes how one colony can split to create more colonies, resulting in an overall increase in the number of ants.
Thought: 
  The scenario that best illustrates increasing returns to scale is one in which there is a larger number of individuals or agents that can work together to produce more output than a smaller number of individuals or agents. 
  Option B describes how a large bee colony is able to collect more nectar than a small bee colony, because some of the bees can focus solely on guarding the nectar sources, which allows the colony to collect more nectar and feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar. 
  This exemplifies increasing returns to scale because the larger bee colony is able to achieve a higher level of productivity than the smaller colony by dividing up tasks and having some bees specialize in particular roles.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar. 
Criticism: 
  There are other scenarios in the options that also describe situations where there is an increase in productivity due to some kind of specialization or collaboration, such as option E. 
  However, option B is the best answer because it explicitly describes a situation where the number of bees in the colony is increasing, resulting in an overall increase in productivity due to specialization and division of labor.
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which means that as the size of a business or industry increases, the productivity of each worker increases as well. 
  A: This option is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale as it does not describe that as the size of a business or industry increases, workers' productivity increases as well.
  B: This option is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale as it is describing a natural division of labor among bees as a way to increase productivity and has nothing to do with the size of the bee colony.
  C: This option is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale as it is describing a way to increase the number of students that can be accommodated in a single building through a scheduling change.
  D: This option is related to the concept of increasing returns to scale as it describes how advances in technology can help the lobster industry catch more lobsters with the same amount of traps, increasing productivity.
  E: This option is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale as it is describing how one ant colony splits into two colonies, which is not related to the size of an industry or business. 
Thought: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which means that as the size of a business or industry increases, the productivity of each worker increases as well. 
  The lobster industry example given in option D describes how an advance in technology has allowed the industry to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps, which is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the answer is D.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the logic of selecting option D as the answer as it describes how the lobster industry can increase productivity as the size of the industry increases through technological advancements.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The concept of increasing returns to scale is described in the second paragraph of the passage.
  The passage states that there are increasing returns to scale when the bigger the business, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more output the business can produce per worker.
  A: The passage does not mention relaxation of standards in regards to increasing returns to scale.
  B: The passage does not mention bee colonies in regards to increasing returns to scale.
  C: The passage does not mention year-round operation or the school district in regards to increasing returns to scale.
  D: The passage does mention that increasing returns to scale can lead to a natural tendency towards monopoly, but it is not clear from the given statement if there is a monopoly or if the increase in lobsters caught is due to larger scale or technological advances.
  E: The example in option E is not related to business or economics, and does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale means that the bigger the business, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more output the business can produce per worker.
  Option D does not clearly state whether the increase in lobster caught is due to increasing size or technological advances.
  Options A, B, C, and E are not related to increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, none of the options is a good example of increasing returns to scale.
Criticism: 
  The given options are not good examples of increasing returns to scale, but the passage itself provides examples of increasing returns to scale. One example is the pin factory described in the passage.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the early form of writing on clay tablets found in the Sumerian city of Uruk.

  Therefore, it is not possible to determine the author's agreement regarding the sign for "sheep" from the information provided in the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of abstract symbols in early writing systems.
  The sign for "sheep" is a circled cross, not an image of a sheep.
Thought: 
  The author of the passage would most likely agree that the sign for "sheep" is an example of an abstract symbol used in early writing systems.
  Therefore, the answer is not C, since the author does not comment on the agricultural nature of sheep.
  The answer is not D, since the author acknowledges the historical significance of the clay tablets found in Uruk.
  The answer is not E, since the author does not comment on the political life of the people who used cuneiform writing.
  The answer is not B, since the author does not compare the sign for "sheep" to the sign for "metal."
  The answer is A, since the author describes how early writing systems used relatively few pictographs and numerous abstract symbols, suggesting that the choice of symbols was arbitrary to some extent.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the development of written language and the precursor to written language.
  Among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C.
  The earliest of the tokens were simple in form - small cones, spheres, and pyramids - and they were often inscribed.
  The token system was replaced in about 3100 B.C. by a system of marks on clay tablets.
  The sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross.
Thought: 
  The passage does not give enough information to definitively determine the author's opinion about the sign for "sheep."
  However, since the author mentions the abstract symbols used in early writing, it could be argued that the author might agree that the sign for "sheep" is abstract and does not resemble an actual sheep.
  Therefore, A, B, C, and E are not likely to be the best answer.
  The only option remaining is D, which suggests that the way the sign represents its meaning was not previously scrutinized, which is not discussed in the passage. 
  Therefore, D is not a good answer choice either.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide enough information to answer the question definitively. 
  While it is true that the passage does not discuss any scrutiny of the sheep sign prior to Schmandt-Besserat's work, the author does not express an opinion about that fact. Therefore, D is not a very good answer choice.
  It is also possible that the author might not agree that the sign for "sheep" is abstract and does not resemble an actual sheep, so A, B, C, and E cannot be entirely ruled out.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A suggests that recent findings in neuroscience change the way we think about the law and suggests a focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during his time.
  The radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," according to Dostoyevsky. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals.
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and that reality was far more than the merely tangible. 
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit" as opposed to its usefulness.
  Therefore, the attitude of the radical critics toward the significance of artistic merit would be most softened if they were to recognize its full significance when evaluating literary works.
  The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Criticism:
  There is no significant flaw in the logic or reasoning. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism: one that believes art should be above everyday reality, and one that believes art should only exist if it is useful to create a new society.
  Dostoevsky takes a third position and believes that reality is the crucial source of literature, but that reality goes deeper than just the tangible world.
  Dostoevsky believes that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit, and that art should not have to serve a particular political view.
Thought: 
  Dostoevsky disagrees with the radical critics' view that art should only exist if it is useful to creating a new society. 
  He also disagrees with their claim that a literary work's formal aspects are of secondary importance.
  Therefore, Dostoevsky would be most softened toward the radical critics' view if they recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.
  B: Katherine Dunham's ballets were distinct from others produced in North America in that they incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures.
  C: Katherine Dunham's expertise as an anthropologist allowed her to use Caribbean and African dance traditions to express the aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers.
  D: The innovative research methods of Katherine Dunham made possible her discovery that the dance traditions of the Caribbean were derived from earlier African dance traditions.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.

  The structure of the novel is compared to the structure of a jazz composition, with individual voices and improvisations within a fixed framework.
  The passage discusses the unique way that Morrison combines different narrative voices to create a jazz-like structure in her novel.
Thought: 
  The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is that Morrison has found a way to simulate the style of jazz performance in the narration of Jazz.
  This assertion is based on the way that Morrison structures the novel, with individual characters speaking in first person and the narrator using third person.
  The comparison to jazz is based on the way that jazz musicians perform solos within a larger composition.
  The author suggests that Morrison is the first to use this kind of structure in a novel.
  The author does not suggest that other novelists have intentionally tried to simulate the style of another art form in their writing.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not suggest that other novelists have intentionally tried to simulate the style of another art form in their writing, so option A is incorrect.
  The passage does not suggest that other African American novelists have sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, so option B is incorrect.
  The passage does not make a general claim about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists, so option C is incorrect.
  The passage does not suggest that all novels can be found to be somewhat musical in nature, so option D is incorrect.
  The passage does not compare the number of African American writers to the number of non-African American writers who have written novels about music, so option E is incorrect.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, which uses a musical genre as the structuring principle for the entire novel.
  The narrative structure of Jazz is analogous to playing a jazz ensemble with individual solos.
  Duke Ellington constructed his compositions with individual musicians and their unique voices in mind.
Thought: 
  The author discusses the way Toni Morrison's Jazz was structured as a musical composition, with the narrative structure of the novel analogous to playing a jazz ensemble with individual solos.
  In this way, Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  The author asserts that Duke Ellington constructed his compositions with individual musicians and their unique voices in mind.
  From this, it can be inferred that Morrison's approach to structuring Jazz was influenced by Ellington's approach to music composition.
  Therefore, if it were true that a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of jazz music, the author's assertion that Morrison's approach was influenced by Ellington's approach would be most called into question.
  Choice B suggests that this is true, so it is the best answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel "Jazz" and draws comparisons between its narrative structure and jazz music.
  A: The author discusses the similarity of the narrative structure of "Jazz" to the playing of a jazz ensemble.
  B: The passage does not discuss African American novelists who based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
  C: The passage does not make a generalization about novels about non-literary arts and artists.
  D: The passage does not suggest that all novels can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: The passage does not make a comparison between African American and non-African American writers in North America.
Thought: 
  The author discusses Toni Morrison's use of the narrative structure in "Jazz" as being similar to the playing of a jazz ensemble.
  The author claims that Morrison succeeded in creating the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, much like how Duke Ellington constructed his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind.
  The author also notes that the central characters in "Jazz" are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but their sections are set off by quotation marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would most likely be called into question if option A were not true.
  Answer: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how it draws upon the structure of jazz music in its narration.
  A: The author's intention in simulating a style of jazz performance is not explicitly stated in the passage.
  B: The passage only discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, not other works of African American literature.
  C: The passage does not make a generalization about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists.
  D: The passage does not make a broad claim about all novels being musical in nature.
  E: The passage does not make a comparison between African American and non-African American writers in terms of writing about music.
Thought:
  The author discusses how Toni Morrison's Jazz draws upon the structure of jazz music in its narration.
  The author is making a unique claim about Jazz, and not a generalization about all novels.
  Therefore, options A, B, C, D, and E are not accurate.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the relationship between music and literature, particularly in the African American tradition.
  Toni Morrison's novel Jazz uses a musical genre as the structuring principle for the narrative.
  The narrative structure of Jazz is analogous to the playing of a jazz ensemble, with individual voices contributing to the whole.
Thought: 
  The author asserts that the narrative structure of Jazz is similar to the structure of a jazz ensemble.
  The jazz ensemble is a form of music where individual voices contribute to a collective whole.
  Jazz has a narrative structure where individual characters contribute to the overarching story.
  Therefore, the author's assertion would be most called into question if there were evidence that Jazz does not use a structure analogous to a jazz ensemble.
  This evidence could be that Jazz does not have individual characters contributing to the overarching story.
  Since none of the answer choices provide this evidence, the best answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to the musical genre of jazz and Duke Ellington's style of composition.
  The author of the passage notes that while many African American writers have used music as a theme in their writing, none had based an entire novel on a musical genre until Jazz.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how Toni Morrison used the musical genre of jazz as the structuring principle for her novel Jazz.
  The narrative structure of Jazz is analogous to the playing of a jazz hand, with individual solo performances set within the larger ensemble sound.
  The author argues that Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, similar to Duke Ellington's style of composition.
  The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if there were evidence that this analogy between the narrative structure of Jazz and the playing of a jazz hand is not supported by the text.
  None of the other answer choices directly address the author's assertion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The article is discussing Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music, specifically to the structure of jazz music.
  The article suggests that the way in which Jazz is narrated is similar to the way in which a jazz ensemble plays music.
Thought: 
  The author asserts that Morrison has "found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration." (Lines 14-16)
  This assertion implies that the structure of Jazz is similar to the structure of a jazz ensemble.
  Therefore, the author's assertion would be most called into question if it were not true that Morrison has used the structure of jazz in the narration of Jazz.
  Choice A states that it is evident that Morrison has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  If this is true, then the author's assertion is supported and would not be called into question.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Criticism: 
  The author's assertion is based on the assumption that Morrison has used the structure of jazz in the narration of Jazz.
  However, it is possible to interpret the structure of Jazz in other ways that do not involve jazz music.
  Additionally, the author's assertion does not necessarily mean that Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance.
  Therefore, there is some room for doubt, but A is still the best answer choice.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music, specifically the genre of jazz. 
  The author notes the similarity between the structure of Jazz and the structure of jazz music, particularly the way in which the narrative allows for individual voices and improvisation within a larger framework. 
Thought: 
  The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is related to the way in which Morrison has constructed Jazz to reflect the structure of jazz music. 
  Therefore, if A, B, C, D, or E were true, they would not necessarily undermine the author's assertion. 
  However, if A were true, it would directly support the author's assertion by stating that Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story. 
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to be made here since the thought process is sound and the choices are thoroughly reviewed. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and the way in which it is structured like a jazz ensemble, with narration that shifts between third-person and first-person voices of characters. 
  The author contrasts the solo improvisations of jazz musicians with the overarching structure of the composition, constructed by the composer and conductor, Duke Ellington. 
Thought: 
  The author discusses how Toni Morrison's Jazz employs a narrative style that resembles the structure of a jazz ensemble, with the narrator acting as both composer and conductor, and the characters as soloists. 
  The author also contrasts the improvisation of individual soloists with the overarching structure of the composition directed by the conductor. 
  The author suggests that this structure is analogous to the structure of Jazz, with Morrison acting as both composer and conductor, and the characters as soloists. 
  The author argues that this structure redefines the possibilities of narrative point of view. 
  Therefore, the author would most likely assert that the novel Jazz simulates the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity. 
  The answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to the structure of jazz music.

  The author claims that Jazz imitates the structure of jazz music in its narration style.
  The author suggests that Morrison allows characters to speak and improvise within the fixed narrative framework, similar to how jazz musicians improvise within a composer's frame.
  The author's assertion is that Morrison has created a new narrative form that is analogous in structure to jazz music.
  None of the answer choices clearly describe the author's assertion.
Criticism:
  The answer choices do not align with the author's assertion.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.
Response 0:
Answer: B
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

The organization of the passage is as follows:
  Two sides of a debate are presented in the beginning.
  Then, a new economic principle, utility maximization, is introduced.
  The principle is used to show that the two sides are actually complementary because they both affect the expected utility of criminal activity.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.

Response 5:
Answer: B
Response 6:
Answer: B
Response 7:
Answer: B
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

The organization of the passage is that two sides of a debate are described, and an economic principle is applied to decide between them. The two sides of the debate are those who believe that societal norms and institutions are the main cause of deliberate crimes, and those who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. The economic principle of utility maximization is then introduced to demonstrate that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the function of the third paragraph within the passage as a whole?
Choices:
  A: to refute traditional interpretations of certain artifacts
  B: to present evidence that undermines a theory
  C: to provide examples that support an argument

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.

Knowledge:
  Passage B discusses how astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus and ultimately discovered the planet Neptune.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides is not relevant to the discovery of Neptune.
  B: Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a separate galaxy is not relevant to the discovery of Neptune.
  C: Walter Alvarez's theory about the extinction of dinosaurs is not relevant to the discovery of Neptune.
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery about Earth's magnetic field is not relevant to the discovery of Neptune.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of an undetected particle is not relevant to the discovery of Neptune.
Thought:
  Passage B explains how astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus and ultimately discovered the planet Neptune.
  The astronomers' prediction for the orbit of Uranus was incorrect, and they hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune.
  Later, scientists discovered Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the discovery of Neptune was the result of using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus and hypothesizing the existence of another planet.
  The most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune is C: Walter Alvarez's theory about the extinction of dinosaurs.
Criticism:
  It could be argued that the discovery of Andromeda as a separate galaxy (B) is more analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as Hubble used observations to make a prediction and then discovered something unexpected that led to a new understanding of the universe.
  However, this analogy is not as strong as the one between the discovery of Neptune and Alvarez's theory about the extinction of dinosaurs, as both involve using observations, making predictions based on auxiliary assumptions, and ultimately discovering something unexpected that led to a new understanding.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune through the deduction of the existence of another planet to explain the observed orbit of Uranus.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right and settled the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and later evidence of an impact crater was discovered.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field, indicating a reversal of Earth's magnetic field in the past.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third undetected particle to explain the apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy in neutron decay.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune through the deduction of the existence of another planet to explain the observed orbit of Uranus.
  The planet Uranus was discovered, and astronomers attempted to predict its orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  Scientists hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity to align their calculation with the observations, and later, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place.
  Therefore, the scientific episode most analogous to the discovery of Neptune described in passage B is C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and later evidence of an impact crater was discovered.
  The impact crater found in the Yucatan Peninsula was the evidence that supported the hypothesis made by Alvarez.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  In Passage B, astronomers predicted the existence of a planet based on observations of Uranus' orbit and auxiliary assumptions. They named this planet "Vulcan." They were not able to find this planet, and eventually, Einstein's theory of relativity predicted the orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and the discovery of Neptune.
  A: Galileo proposed a theory that falsely predicted there would be only one high tide per day, and later it was discovered that there were two high tides.
  B: Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, and later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field, leading him to conclude that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third undetected particle during the decay of a neutron into a proton and an electron, and the particle's existence was later confirmed.
Thought:
  In Passage B, astronomers predicted the existence of a planet based on observations of Uranus' orbit and auxiliary assumptions. They named this planet "Vulcan." They were not able to find this planet, and eventually, Einstein's theory of relativity predicted the orbit of Mercury after the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity, leading to the discovery of Neptune.
  The scenario that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the one where a prediction was made based on observations and auxiliary assumptions, but the prediction was not borne out, leading to the hypothesis of the existence of another factor that could account for the observations.
  So, the scenario that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the prediction of the existence of Vulcan in the vicinity of Mercury, which was not borne out and led to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field, leading him to conclude that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers discovered the planet Neptune using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the existence of other planets.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides and the number of high tides in a day is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
  B: Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
  C: Walter Alvarez's postulation of an asteroid impact causing dinosaur extinction is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery of magnetized rocks is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of an undetected particle is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the existence of other planets to predict the orbit of Uranus. 
  When the orbit they predicted was incorrect, they hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they called Neptune.
  Later, astronomers discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is one in which scientists hypothesized the existence of an undetected planet based on observations and calculations, and later discovered the planet in the predicted location.
  Only choice B describes a scientific episode that involves hypothesizing the existence of a celestial object based on observations and calculations, and later discovering it in the predicted location. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus but their predictions were incorrect because of an error in their auxiliary assumptions, which was later corrected by the discovery of Neptune.
  A: Galileo proposed a theory of tides, but it falsely predicted the number of high tides in a day. 
  B: Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy and settled the debate about whether the Milky Way is the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez proposed a theory that an asteroid caused the extinction of dinosaurs, which was later confirmed by the discovery of an impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks magnetized in a direction opposite to the present-day magnetic field, and concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third undetected particle during the decay of a neutron, and the particle's existence was later confirmed.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers made incorrect predictions about Uranus's orbit, but later corrected it by hypothesizing the existence of another planet.
  Similarly, scientists made incorrect predictions about the orbit of Mercury and hypothesized the existence of another planet named Vulcan, which was never found.
  However, Einstein's theory of relativity explained Mercury's orbit, and scientists rejected Newton's theory of gravity.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the incorrect prediction of Mercury's orbit and the hypothesis of Vulcan.
  The correct prediction of the existence and location of Neptune corrects the mistake in the auxiliary assumptions.
  Choice B, C, D, and E seem to describe different scientific episodes that don't resemble the discovery of Neptune.
  Hence, the answer is A: Galileo proposed a theory of tides, but it falsely predicted the number of high tides in a day.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between the discovery of Neptune and Galileo's theory of tides is not clear.
  The question asks for an episode described in Passage B, but the analogy is based on a comparison with Passage A.
  The answer, A, doesn't seem to have a clear connection to the passage.
  Therefore, it is difficult to choose a definitive answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers discovered the planet Neptune by hypothesizing its existence to explain a discrepancy in the predicted and observed orbit of Uranus.
  A: This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  B: This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  C: This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  D: This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  E: This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they later discovered, to explain a discrepancy in the predicted and observed orbit of Uranus.
  Therefore, the analogous scientific episode involves hypothesizing the existence of an entity to explain a discrepancy.
  The only choice that involves hypothesizing the existence of an entity to explain a discrepancy is C, where Walter Alvarez hypothesizes the existence of an asteroid impact to explain the extinction of the dinosaurs.
  Therefore, the answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune based on the discrepancies in the predicted and observed orbit of Uranus. The astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet, which was later discovered in the precise location needed to bring their calculations into alignment.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides did not accurately predict the number of high tides per day, but it is not related to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  B: Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy is a separate scientific episode and is not related to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  C: Walter Alvarez's postulation of an asteroid impact causing dinosaur extinction is another scientific episode and is not related to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery of rocks with a reversed magnetic field is another scientific episode and is not related to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of a third undetected particle to explain the discrepancy in energy during neutron decay is another scientific episode and is not related to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
Thought:
  Passage B describes how the discovery of Neptune was made based on the discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus.
  The astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet to explain the discrepancies, and it was later discovered in the precise location needed to bring their calculations into alignment.
  The situation described in Passage B is most analogous to a case where a theory predicts an outcome, but observations reveal discrepancies that cannot be explained by the theory alone.
  A possible explanation is hypothesized, and later confirmed by additional observations.
  The most analogous scientific episode is C: Walter Alvarez's postulation of an asteroid impact causing dinosaur extinction. Alvarez postulated this theory based on observing high levels of iridium in certain rock core samples, but later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the existence of a planet (Neptune) based on the failure of their previous predictions of Uranus's orbit. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which was later discovered in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when there are actually two.
  B: Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right by observing "variable stars" that vary in brightness.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field, concluding that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third undetected particle during the decay of a neutron, which was later confirmed.
Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the existence of Neptune based on the failure of their previous predictions of Uranus's orbit. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which was later discovered in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Analogously, choice C describes how Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction. 
  Both instances involve scientists observing anomalous data, hypothesizing a possible explanation for that data, and later discovering evidence that confirmed their hypothesis.
  Therefore, choice C is the most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as described in Passage B.
Criticism:
  There is no major flaw in the logic or facts used to arrive at the answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes an episode in which astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus, but their predictions were incorrect. They hypothesized the existence of another planet that they called Neptune, and later discovered it in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
Thought:
  Astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. 
  Their predictions were incorrect, leading them to hypothesize the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune.
  Later, they discovered Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is one in which scientists hypothesized the existence of a new entity based on their observations, and later discovered that entity in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  The only choice that fits this pattern is E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes how astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus. 
  The predictions were incorrect but were corrected by hypothesizing the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which was later discovered and named Neptune.
Thought:
  The question asks for the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as described in passage B.
  The discovery of Neptune was made by hypothesizing the existence of another planet to account for an anomaly in the orbit of Uranus.
  Options A, B, D, and E describe entirely different scientific episodes that are not directly analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option C describes how Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on observing the high level of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples.
  Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  This is analogous to the discovery of Neptune because scientists used indirect evidence, in this case, high iridium levels, to hypothesize a cause of an observed phenomenon, in this case, dinosaur extinction.
  Later evidence, in this case, the discovery of the impact crater, confirmed the hypothesis.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Walter Alvarez's hypothesis about the extinction of the dinosaurs.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not a reliable guide for policy decisions because people's judgments about voluntariness are often based on faulty reasoning and selective attention.
Thought: 
  The author believes that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. The government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction and not based on whether a risk is voluntary or involuntary. 
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with the statement that is consistent with this view. 
  Statement A, which suggests that people should not be protected against risks incurred through dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose, is not directly addressed in the passage. 
  Statement B, which suggests that policy experts would not consider the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly to be relevant, is somewhat consistent with the passage, but it is not the author's main point. 
  Statement C, which compares the risks of plane crashes to other kinds of risks incurred by airline passengers, is not addressed in the passage. 
  Statement D, which suggests that a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice, is inconsistent with the author's view that judgments about voluntariness are often based on faulty reasoning. 
  Statement E, which suggests that the main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster, is not addressed in the passage. 
  Therefore, the best answer is "None of the Above" since none of the statements accurately reflects the author's view.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is often misleading and of little utility in guiding policy decisions. 
  The author suggests that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness and that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
Thought: 
  The passage implies that the author believes that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is often misleading and is not a useful guide for determining government policy. 
  The author suggests that the government should attempt to save as many lives as possible with the resources available, regardless of whether a risk is voluntary or involuntary.
  Therefore, the author would likely agree with the statement that people should generally be protected against risks incurred through dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose.
  The author would also likely agree with the statement that the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  However, there is no evidence in the passage to support the statements in choices C, D, or E.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not always clear and can be influenced by factors such as the public's approval of the purpose of the activity.
  A: The author does not explicitly state a position on whether people should be protected against risks incurred through dangerous activities with no socially useful purpose.
  B: The author suggests that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, but that laypeople care whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. The author does not state whether this is relevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: The author does not provide information on the probability of occurrence or resulting death or injury for plane crashes compared to other risks.
  D: The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not always clear and should not be the sole basis for policy decisions.
  E: The author does not state that natural disasters are the main category of risk that is usually incurred involuntarily.
Thought: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not always clear and should not be the sole basis for policy decisions.
  The author suggests that policy decisions should focus on saving as many lives as possible, subject to limited public and private resources.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that policy decisions should be based on factors other than whether a risk is voluntarily incurred.
  The answer is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks.
  The author argues that the distinction is not always useful in guiding policy decisions.
  The author suggests that instead of focusing on voluntariness, policy decisions should be guided by understanding the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
Thought: 
  The author argues against the usefulness of the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks.
  The author suggests that policy decisions should be guided by understanding the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with a statement that reflects this position.
  Statement D reflects the author's suggestion that a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are subject to that risk only through a particular choice.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the idea of voluntary and involuntary risks and how they are judged.
Thought: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is often blurred and not useful in guiding policy decisions. 
  The government should attempt to save as many lives as possible within the limited resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Option A is not supported in the passage as the author does not distinguish between socially useful or non-useful activities.
  Option B might be relevant to the argument about voluntariness being irrelevant and people focusing on a small part of the complex interaction, but it does not show the author's agreement or disagreement. 
  Option C is not discussed in the passage, and it is not clear whether it is true or false. 
  Option D is consistent with the author's argument that voluntariness is not a clear-cut matter and should not be the sole focus of regulatory policy.
  Option E is not supported in the passage, as the author does not discuss natural disasters. 
  Therefore, the best option is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. 
Criticism: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is often blurred, and that the government should focus on saving as many lives as possible within limited resources. 
  However, the passage does not explicitly state agreement or disagreement with option D. 
  Therefore, an argument can be made for other options as well. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:

Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  Ozone is a toxic form of oxygen that screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  Natural production and destruction keeps stratospheric ozone concentrations stable over time.
  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) attack and deplete the ozone layer, which diminishes its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
Thought: 
  The passage provides detailed information about the depletion of the ozone layer.
  The passage also states that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The passage further states that each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  The answer is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to the release of manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) into the atmosphere.
  Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  Ozone in the stratosphere shields the earth from ultraviolet radiation.
  CFCs react with ultraviolet radiation and release chlorine, which destroys ozone molecules.
Thought: 
  The passage provides evidence that CFCs can damage the ozone layer and that this can contribute to skin cancer.
  The passage describes how CFCs release chlorine, which destroys ozone molecules, so the correct statement should be about the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  Statement A is incorrect because the passage states that the production and destruction of ozone are typically in equilibrium.
  Statement B is incorrect because while excessive absorption of ultraviolet light contributes to skin cancer, the passage does not suggest that it is the primary cause.
  Statement C is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about other chemicals that may release chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  Statement D is correct because the depletion of the ozone layer can lead to increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which in turn can contribute to skin cancer.
  Statement E is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state that regulating the use of CFCs lowers the incidence of skin cancer, but it does suggest that depletion of the ozone layer due to CFCs can increase exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which is a risk factor for skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")

  Ozone is a toxic form of oxygen that screens out the sun's most damaging UV radiation.
  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer caused by CFCs.
  The CFCs chemically react with ozone, resulting in the release of chlorine atoms, which destroy ozone molecules and regenerate more chlorine atoms.
  This can lead to a cascade effect, with each chlorine atom potentially destroying as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  The passage does not suggest that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present (A).
  While the passage mentions skin cancer as a result of exposure to UV radiation, it does not suggest that skin cancer occurs primarily because of excessive absorption of UV light (B).
  The passage suggests that few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere (C), but it does not provide evidence to strongly support this claim.
  The passage does suggest that regulating the use of CFCs contributes to lowering the incidence of skin cancer indirectly (D), as CFCs contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, which shields against UV radiation.
  Finally, the passage does not suggest that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica (E).
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")

  Molina and Rowland's research led to the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica and the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought:
  The passage provides evidence that manufactured CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  Chlorine and ozone react in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  The depletion of the ozone layer leads to a reduction in the ozone's effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Reduced ozone levels increase the incidence of skin cancer, so regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the information in the passage is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the passage to support A, B, C, or E.
  A is incorrect because the passage states that natural production and destruction of ozone should be in rough equilibrium in the absence of pollutants.
  B is incorrect because the passage discusses how ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer, not excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C is incorrect because the passage does not discuss other chemicals besides CFCs that can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  E is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

  C: The article discusses the dangers of CFCs, but does not say that few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: The article discusses the dangers of ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer, and advocates for dramatic policy changes to stop the depletion of the ozone layer, which would subsequently reduce the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth's surface. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The article mentions that CFCs slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere and are subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, but does not say that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Thought:

  Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured CFCs deplete the ozone layer by releasing chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Depletion of the ozone layer leads to increased ultraviolet radiation, which causes skin cancer.
  Advocacy of dramatic policy changes was necessary to stop the depletion of the ozone layer.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  The answer is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Criticism: 
  There is no direct evidence in the article that regulating the use of CFCs contributes to lowering the incidence of skin cancer. 
  However, the article does link the depletion of the ozone layer, caused in part by CFCs, with an increase in ultraviolet radiation, which in turn causes skin cancer.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

Response 0:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to:
Knowledge: The third paragraph follows the first and second paragraphs, which describe the ways that elite classes historically commissioned art and the difficulties of analyzing such art, respectively.
Thought: 
  The paragraph begins by identifying the two social classes able to commission art in history.
  The paragraph then suggests that the taste of these two classes has not always been apt to produce art that endures.
  The paragraph goes on to explain how talented artists sometimes found a place in the margins of the establishment.
  The paragraph also discusses how some art paid for by the establishment went against the grain of elite values, but endured anyway.
  Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to provide additional information about the challenges of analyzing art produced for and by the elite, including the fact that not all art commissioned by the elite embodied their ideals, some artists found ways to subvert the ideals of their patrons, and some art that went against the grain of elite values still endured.
  The paragraph does not reject a possible response to the argument made in the first paragraph or present an argument that weakens the argument made in the second paragraph or draw a definitive conclusion from the claims made in the second paragraph.
  The paragraph identifies assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The third paragraph discusses the two social classes that were able to commission art, the aristocratic or governing class, and the middle class. The author notes that the taste of these classes has not always produced enduring art and that more talented artists sometimes found a place in the margins of the establishment. Additionally, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for unwillingly and with misgivings. 
Thought: 
  The third paragraph does not reject a possible response to the argument made in the first paragraph. It also does not present an argument that weakens the argument made in the second paragraph. Instead, the paragraph offers additional evidence and context to the argument made in the second paragraph, which is that art historically was "produced by and for political and social elites." The third paragraph identifies assumptions relied upon by the sociohistorical analysis referred to in the first paragraph that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived. 
  Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. It explains the limitations of the sociohistorical approach to art and highlights that for this approach to be effective, it requires a recognizable identity of the elite and the establishment of their consensus about the world and how life should be lived. The paragraph also notes that the taste of the aristocracy and the upper-middle class has not always been apt to produce an enduring art, and that often, some of the art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Hence, the paragraph provides an explanation and context for the kind of analysis that Taruskin and others employ in their sociohistorical interpretations of art. Therefore, the correct answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Response 7:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. This paragraph identifies the assumptions that must be met in order for the sociohistorical criticism used by Taruskin to be successful. Specifically, it addresses the need to establish a recognizable identity and consensus among the elite classes that commission art, and the possibility that artists may subvert the ideals of their patrons for their own reasons. Therefore, the correct choice is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Response 8:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Therefore, the Answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.

Thought: 
  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to provide an example of the second way that historically art was produced by and for political and social elites, which is creating a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  The frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, which makes him the patron and the representative of the governing class, who belong to the elites.
  Therefore, the answer is C: to present an example of the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.
  However, it is not explicitly stated that the relationship between Raphael and Pope Julius II was the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist.
  It is only stated that this relationship is an example of the second way that art was produced by and for political and social elites.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements
  B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines
  C: a hypothetical situation supporting a statement reported by the author in the earlier lines
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the responsibilities of defense lawyers in providing legal representation to their clients.
  The author argues that defense lawyers have a responsibility to their clients as well as to the court and society.
  In cases where lawyers are convinced that their clients are guilty, they should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  Rather, they should present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.
Thought: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 state that in cases where lawyers are convinced that their clients are guilty, they should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  This is in agreement with the author's position that defense lawyers have a responsibility to the court and society.
  However, the sentences at lines 28-31 provide specific guidance on what lawyers should do in these situations, whereas the sentences at lines 7-11 provide a more general overview of the responsibilities of defense lawyers.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 and that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can best be described as agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
  The answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Criticism: 
  I have no criticism of this answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligations and responsibilities of defense lawyers.
  Legal scholars have different opinions on whether defense lawyers need to believe that their clients are innocent.
Thought:
  The information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 is related to the earlier lines at 7-11.
  The earlier lines at 7-11 discuss the opinion of some legal scholars that a lawyer's job is to provide the best defense possible without expressing personal opinions or beliefs.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 state that it is a lawyer's duty not to deny if they know that a client is guilty, but rather to present any extenuating circumstances and argue for leniency in sentencing.
  This contradicts the earlier opinion that lawyers should not express personal opinions or beliefs.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences at lines 28-31 and the earlier lines at 7-11 is that they represent a disagreement over the responsibilities of defense lawyers.
  The answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Criticism:
  There is no agreement between the two positions presented in the passage.
  The opinion of the legal scholars at lines 7-11 is that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation.
  The position presented at lines 28-31 is that lawyers' obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court and, by extension, to society. Lawyers should not present to the court assertions that they know to be false, and they should not undertake to demonstrate their clients' innocence if they are convinced that their clients are guilty.
  Therefore, the correct answer is not D.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the obligations of defense lawyers towards their clients, the courts, and society.
  The author argues that lawyers should not present assertions that they know to be false to the court.
  The author believes that lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that when lawyers know that their clients are guilty, they should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  This is related to the earlier discussion about the role of defense lawyers and their obligation to their clients, the court, and society.
  The author argues that lawyers should not present assertions that they know to be false to the court.
  If lawyers know that their clients are guilty, then presenting assertions that they are innocent would be presenting false statements to the court.
  Therefore, the sentence at lines 28-31 is a specific example supporting the author's earlier argument about lawyers' obligations towards the court and society.
  The two sentences are not unrelated factual statements (A).
  The author is not opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines (B).
  The sentence at lines 28-31 is not a hypothetical situation (C).
  The author agrees in general with the earlier position but is not disagreeing over the particulars (D).
  The most accurate description is that the two sentences are essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives (E).
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the responsibility of defense lawyers to their clients and to the court/society.
- The first opinion presented in the passage suggests that defense lawyers are not obligated to believe in the innocence of their clients, but rather to provide the best defense possible.
- The second opinion presented in the passage is that defense lawyers should not present assertions to the court that they know to be false, and that they should not undertake to demonstrate the innocence of clients they know to be guilty.
Thought:
- The sentence at lines 28-31 states that defense lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate the innocence of clients they know to be guilty.
- The sentence at lines 7-11 presents the opinion that defense lawyers should provide the best defense possible, and not judge defendants because that is the job of the courts.
- These two sentences are related because they both address the responsibilities of defense lawyers to their clients, the courts, and society.
- Specifically, the sentence at lines 28-31 modifies the earlier opinion by stating that defense lawyers should not try to demonstrate the innocence of clients they know to be guilty, which is a limitation on the earlier opinion.
- Therefore, the relationship between the two sets of sentences can be described as D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Criticism:
- This analysis assumes that the sentence at lines 28-31 is a direct response or limitation to the opinion presented at lines 7-11, which may not be explicitly clear.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients, the court, and society.
- The passage suggests that defense lawyers should not present arguments that they know to be false.
- The passage suggests that defense lawyers should not argue for the innocence of guilty clients but should instead argue for leniency in sentencing.
- The passage suggests that defense lawyers should try to prove the innocence of clients that they believe may be innocent.
Thought:
- The sentences at lines 28-31 state that defense lawyers should not argue for the innocence of guilty clients but should instead argue for leniency in sentencing.
- This is related to the earlier sentences (lines 7-11) that state that some legal scholars argue that defense lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court.
- The two sets of sentences are related in that they both discuss the obligations of defense lawyers to their clients and the court.
- The sentences at lines 28-31 provide a specific example of how defense lawyers should fulfill their obligation to their clients and the court.
- Overall, the sentences at lines 28-31 support the earlier position presented in lines 7-11.
Answer: E) essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the role of defense lawyers and their obligation to their clients as well as to the court and society.
  Lines 7-11 report the opinion of some legal scholars that the sole obligation of defense lawyers is to provide the best defense they are capable of without judging the defendants' guilt or innocence.
  Lines 28-31 argue that lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their clients' innocence if they are convinced that their clients are guilty and should appraise the case and present extenuating circumstances instead.
Thought:
  Lines 28-31 disagree with the position reported in lines 7-11.
  While lines 7-11 argue that lawyers should provide the best defense, even if they believe their clients are guilty, lines 28-31 argue that guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation, and lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their clients' innocence if they are convinced that their clients are guilty.
  Therefore, lines 28-31 represent a disagreement with the position reported in lines 7-11.
Answer: D) agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligations of defense lawyers to their clients, the court, and society.
  The passage argues that defense lawyers should not present assertions they know to be false.
  The passage states that if lawyers are convinced their clients are guilty, they should appraise the case in their client's favor and present extenuating circumstances and arguments for leniency in sentencing.
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that lawyers who are convinced their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  This position opposes the earlier statement that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best possible defense for their clients, regardless of their guilt or innocence.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in lines 28-31 to the sentence at lines 7-11 is one of disagreement.
  The answer is D: disagreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the role of defense lawyers and their obligations to both their clients and the court/society.
  Lines 28-31 discuss the idea that lawyers should not take cases if they are not willing to provide sincere representation.
  Lines 7-11 discuss the idea that some legal scholars believe that defense lawyers have the sole obligation to provide the best defense for their clients.
Thought:
  The two sentences at lines 28-31 state the idea that lawyers should not take cases if they are not willing to provide sincere representation.
  This idea is related to the earlier statement about the role of defense lawyers, which is that their obligation is twofold: to their client and to the court/society.
  If lawyers do not provide sincere representation, they are not fulfilling their obligation to the court/society.
  Therefore, the two statements are related because they both discuss the obligations of defense lawyers.
  The relationship between the two statements can be described as agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
  While both statements discuss the obligations of defense lawyers, they differ in the specifics of how lawyers should fulfill these obligations.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the role of defense lawyers.
  Some legal scholars believe that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of.
  According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves.
Thought: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 discuss the lawyer's obligation to the court and to society.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 describes the position of some legal scholars regarding the lawyer's role.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 support the position of the author in the earlier lines, because the author argues that lawyers have a twofold obligation: to the defendant and to the court/society.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 is agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
  The author agrees with the legal scholars that the lawyer's role is to provide the best defense they are capable of, but disagrees with the scholars' position that the lawyer's obligation is solely to the defendant and not to the court/society.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the role of defense lawyers and their obligations to their clients, the court, and society.
  The passage argues that lawyers should not present false or insincere representations to the court.
  The passage argues that lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
Thought:
  The information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 discusses the duty of a lawyer to only present arguments that the lawyer sincerely believes are warranted, particularly in cases where the lawyer knows with certainty that a defendant is guilty.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 discusses the nature of legal scholars' argument that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of and that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence.
  Both sentences focus on the obligations of defense lawyers to their clients and to the court.
  However, the sentence at lines 28-31 provides a counterargument to the legal scholars' position, while the sentence at lines 7-11 is reporting that position.
  Therefore, the relationship can be described as the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines.
  The answer is B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: In what other areas besides Europe did Spanish-language proverbs currently used in Mexican American communities originate?
  B: Are any proverbs that are used frequently in the English-language tradition derived from Mexican American proverbs?

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

  The passage explains that the concept of self was markedly inclusive in some pre-contact Native American cultures, and that expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events rather than a lifetime of recollections.
  The author is pointing out that traditional Native American modes of communicating personal history were different than European-style autobiography, which is rooted in the concept of a single person's life story.
  Therefore, the answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that the author is defining the word "autobiography" itself, as in choice B.
  The author is not discussing how words can change meaning over time, as in choice C.
  While the passage explains that the assumptions underlying European-style autobiography arose from European culture, the author is not positing a fundamental similarity between European and Native American cultures, as in choice D.
  The passage primarily describes the differences between European and Native American concepts of self, life, and writing rather than explaining how they arose, as in choice E.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how Native American modes of autobiographical expression differed from European-style autobiography. 
  A: The passage makes a contrast between Native American and European concepts of self, life, and writing; it is implied that the concepts are different.
  B: The passage does not discuss changes in the meaning of words.
  C: The passage notes that the English word "autobiography" has a root meaning that does not apply to Native American modes of self-expression, but it does not discuss how words can change their meaning.
  D: The passage does not suggest that there is a fundamental similarity in the origins of the concept of self, life, and writing in Native American and European cultures.
  E: The passage explains how Native American modes of self-expression differed from European-style autobiography, but it does not discuss how the assumptions that underlie European-style autobiography arose.
Thought: 
  The author refers to "self, life, and writing" to illustrate how Native American and European concepts about these concepts differed. The differences in these concepts are important because they affect how individuals choose to express their life experiences.
  The answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Criticism: 
  The answer is correct, as the passage contrasts the Native American and European concepts of self, life, and writing. However, it is also relevant to note that the passage emphasizes the limitations of focusing only on written, as-told-to life histories in studying Native American autobiographical expression.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author explains that early Native Americans did not share the same assumptions about self, life, and writing as Europeans did. The European concept of autobiography is grounded in an individualistic and linear notion of self and life that is conveyed through writing. In contrast, Native American concepts of identity were more inclusive and relational, and personal history was not necessarily conveyed through writing, but through oral and visual modes of expression that were often communal and oriented toward current events.
Thought:

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the differences between European-style autobiography and Native American modes of communicating personal history. 
  The author notes that pre-contact Native American cultures had different assumptions about self, life, and writing than Europeans did.
Thought: 
  The author refers to "self, life, and writing" in order to highlight the differences between European and Native American cultures. 
  The author is specifically discussing how the concept of an autobiography, which is rooted in the European understanding of self and writing, does not necessarily align with pre-contact Native American cultures.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the differences between the European and Native American concepts of self, life, and writing.
Thought:

  Therefore, the answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Criticism: 
  The other answer choices are not supported by the passage. 
  Although the passage discusses differences in the meaning of words, it does not specifically state that the word "autobiography" had a different meaning for early Native Americans than it has for contemporary Native Americans.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the differences between traditional Native American autobiographical modes of communication and the European-style autobiography.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how the concept of self, life, and writing differed between European and Native American cultures and how this influenced their respective forms of autobiographical expression.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholarship that has focused on written, non-Native American authored life histories of Native Americans.
  It contrasts the Native American concept of self, life, and expression of personal history with that of European-style autobiography.
Thought: 
  The author discusses how Native American and European ideas about self, life, and writing differ. 
  European-style autobiography is based on the idea of self as an individual, which is not necessarily the case for some Native American cultures, where identity is relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. 
  The author explains that prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures, Native Americans did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing. 
  The author contrasts the European-style autobiography, which is based on writing and the recollections of a lifetime, with traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history, which can include speech, signs, songs, chants, stories, drama, dance, tattoos, and artifacts. 
  The author also explains that expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events and would involve the participation of fellow tribal members. 
  Therefore, the author most probably refers to "self, life, and writing" to identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
  The answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not define the word "autobiography" or suggest that it had a different meaning for early Native Americans than it has for contemporary Native Americans, so B and C are incorrect.
  The author does not posit a fundamental similarity in the origins of a concept in both European and Native American cultures, so D is incorrect. 
  The author does explain how the assumptions that underlie European-style autobiography arose, but this is not the main purpose of the reference to "self, life, and writing," so E is incorrect.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception
  D: questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence
  E: countering a revolutionary hypothesis

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) and how it is a research method whose validity depends on the premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  FMRI is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain and the differential rate of oxygen use is used to identify the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted by using a subtraction method to identify the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The reasoning is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  Therefore, the manner in which FMRI scans are typically interpreted is most analogous to choice B: a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Criticism: 
  The analogy in choice B is not entirely apt, as it describes a situation in which an advertisement campaign only affected a particular group of shoppers during a certain season, whereas FMRI scans do not only show activity in a particular group of neurons during a certain task. Rather, the entire brain is active in both the control and task conditions.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the use of neuroimaging in psychology to identify localized brain regions responsible for distinct mental functions.
  The FMRI scan is used to measure the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain and is interpreted as a map of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI scan is used to identify the differential rate of oxygen use between two conditions: a baseline measurement in the control condition, and a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
Thought:
  The FMRI scan is interpreted as a map of metabolic activity, but it actually depicts the differential rate of oxygen use between two conditions: a control condition and a cognitive task.
  The reasoning behind this method is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  However, the entire brain is active in both conditions, and the subtractive method obscures the fact that all distributed brain functions are involved.
  Therefore, the FMRI scan is analogous to a situation in which a distinction is made between two conditions based on a subtraction method, which produces a false impression of neat functional localization.
  Choice (B) is the most analogous, as it involves the misattribution of causality to a particular variable (the advertising campaign) based on the observed correlation with another variable (the increase in shoppers during the summer).
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging, specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), in psychology research.
  The interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a second measurement taken while an individual is performing a cognitive task.
  The resulting image is interpreted as representing the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting the baseline measurement from a measurement taken while an individual is performing a cognitive task.
  This method subtracts out all the distributed brain functions, giving a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The method is similar to subtracting out one variable to isolate the impact of another variable.
  Therefore, the most analogous option is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Criticism: 
  There does not appear to be a direct analogy between the interpretation of FMRI scans and any of the options provided.
  While option B involves isolating the impact of a specific variable, the FMRI interpretation involves subtracting a baseline measurement to isolate the metabolic activity associated with a cognitive task.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is still B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) as a research method in psychology.
  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  They are calculated by subtracting a baseline measurement from a second measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The resulting scan is assumed to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought:
  The FMRI scan interpretation involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a second measurement taken during a cognitive task in order to determine the metabolic activity associated solely with the task, obscuring the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  A: This analogy does not relate to the subtraction involved in interpreting an FMRI scan.
  B: This analogy is not similar to the way FMRI scans are interpreted.
  C: This analogy is not similar to the way FMRI scans are interpreted.
  D: This analogy is not similar to the way FMRI scans are interpreted.
  E: This analogy is similar to the way FMRI scans are interpreted, as it involves a situation where one characteristic (speed in cheetahs) is primarily associated with one type of activity (short distances), but not with another type of activity (long distances).
Criticism: 
  The analogy is not a perfect fit because it is not clear from the passage that FMRI scans are primarily associated with one type of activity rather than another.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology.
  The FMRI scan is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, subtracting out all the distributed brain functions.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Thought: 
  The FMRI scan is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, subtracting out all the distributed brain functions.
  A similar analogy is when "much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur."
  Just as the agricultural customers are subtracted out to understand the impact of the drought on the residential customers, the FMRI scan subtracts out all the distributed brain functions to understand the impact of a cognitive task on a specific area of the brain.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
Criticism: 
  The analogy with agricultural and residential customers is not a perfect fit with the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  The FMRI scan does not subtract out the distributed brain functions to understand the impact of a cognitive task on a specific area of the brain.
  Rather, it subtracts out the baseline measurement to determine the difference in metabolic activity between the control and the cognitive task conditions.
  A better analogy might be the way that advertisements affect summer versus winter shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans to map brain activity.
  FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The scans are interpreted as a map of metabolic activity during a cognitive task, with the baseline measurement subtracted from the on-task measurement.
Thought: 
  The passage compares the interpretation of FMRI scans to a subtraction method.
  The method subtracts a baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to depict the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  This method is like subtracting out all the distributed brain functions to produce a false impression of neat functional localization.
  Choice B describes a similarly flawed method of attributing causality to a specific factor, in this case advertising, that may not actually be the cause of the observed effect.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  FMRI is a research method used in psychology.
  The validity of FMRI as a research method depends on the premise that the mind can be decomposed into separate and distinct modules.
  The modular theory of mind is contested.
  FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  FMRI scans of brain activity are produced using a subtractive method.
  One problem with the subtractive method is that it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans of brain activity are produced using a subtractive method.
  The subtractive method produces a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The map is a measure of metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  So, the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted is most analogous to B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Criticism: 
  The analogy in B is not very strong because the advertising campaign only affected summer shoppers, while the cognitive task would presumably activate the entire brain.
  A better analogy might be D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  FMRI scans are subtractive, with the baseline measurement subtracted from the on-task measurement.
  This produces a false impression of neat functional localization.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting baseline from on-task measurements to produce a false impression of neat functional localization.
  This is similar to how one could interpret high internet traffic during the evening hours as originating mostly from homes rather than office buildings, when in reality the traffic is also present in office buildings.
  Therefore, choice D is the most analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology and the issue of the modular theory of mind.
  FMRI stands for functional magnetic resonance imaging and is a method used to measure metabolic activity in different parts of the brain.
  The FMRI scan is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain by taking a baseline measurement in the control condition and then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement to focus solely on the metabolic activity associated with the cognitive task.
Thought: 
  The passage describes the FMRI method used to measure metabolic activity in different parts of the brain.
  The method involves taking a baseline measurement in the control condition and then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  The baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to focus solely on the metabolic activity associated with the cognitive task.
  This method is similar to the following: 
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district. (Not similar to FMRI interpretation)
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. (Not similar to FMRI interpretation)
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur. (Not similar to FMRI interpretation)
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings. (Not similar to FMRI interpretation)
  E: The cheetah is the world's fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances. (Not similar to FMRI interpretation)
  Therefore, there is no analogy among the given options and none of the choices is correct.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) as a research method in psychology, which relies on the notion that the mind can be broken down into distinct modules and that these modules correspond to specific localized areas in the brain. However, this premise is not necessarily valid, as some argue that mental processes are distributed throughout the brain. The FMRI measures the differential rate of oxygen use between a baseline measurement and a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task; the difference between the two measurements is interpreted as the metabolic activity associated solely with the task.
Thought: 
  The FMRI scan is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, but what it actually depicts is the difference in oxygen use between two conditions: a control condition and a cognitive task. The difference is assumed to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the task. This method of interpretation is analogous to which of the given scenarios?
  A: The new mayor could not have won without the votes from a particular district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Agricultural customers use much more of the water supply than residential customers, so they are impacted most severely during droughts.
  D: Most Internet traffic during peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings because internet traffic is highest during the evening hours.
  E: Most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The second proposal of multicultural education holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms, without any value judgments.
  Critics of this second proposal argue that trying to understand non-scientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting but also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Thought: 
  Critics of the second proposal argue that trying to understand another culture by Western scientific methods is not only distorting but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, critics would be most likely to agree with the choice that emphasizes the importance of understanding a culture's values in its social and historical context, such as B.
  Choices A, C, and D are not supported by the information in the passage.
  Choice E is not completely relevant to the objection raised in the second paragraph.
  Thus, the best answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The first two paragraphs describe two different proposals for multicultural education.
  The second version of multicultural education holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue that scientific discourse is often the dominant form of thought and language of Western culture and that trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Thought: 
  The critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that to truly understand non-Western cultures, we must adopt their perspectives and methods of understanding.
  They believe that the Western scientific heritage is too value-laden and that the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures.
  Thus, the critics would be most likely to agree with the statement that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  Option B is the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the logic or reasoning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The second proposal holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms, and the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
  Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue that Western scientific methods of examination are already value-laden, and that to insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Thought: 
  Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would most likely agree with the idea that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values because they argue that understanding nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. They would likely argue that in order to really understand another culture, one has to approach it from more than one cultural perspective and take into account the unique historical and social circumstances that give rise to that culture's values.
  Therefore, the answer is C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
Criticism: 
  Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would also likely agree with the idea that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science. However, this is not the best answer to the question asked, which is asking about their position regarding the study of cultures from different cultural perspectives.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the various proposals for multicultural education, with some arguing for teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture and others advocating for a more neutral approach that avoids imposing Western values. 
  The second version of multicultural education has been criticized for relying on Western scientific methods and perspectives in studying other cultures, which is seen as distorting and promoting Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. 
Thought: 
  The question asks which statement the critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with. 
  The objection raised in the second paragraph is that adopting Western scientific methods and perspectives in studying other cultures is distorting and promotes Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.

  Critics of the second proposal argue that Western scientific methods cannot fully understand or adequately appreciate non-Western cultures.
Thought: 
  Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph argue that genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture is approached from within its own perspective.
  This is in contrast to the first proposal's belief that teaching about other cultures should proceed from within the context of the majority culture.
  Therefore, the critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would most likely agree with choice C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
Criticism: 
  Choice C is not an accurate representation of the critics' objection. The critics argue that genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless it is approached from within its own perspective, not necessarily from more than one cultural perspective. Therefore, choice C should not be selected as the answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The second version of multicultural education advocates a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures and examines cultures through Western scientific methods.
- Critics of this version argue that non-scientific perspectives and methods of the cultures studied are necessary for real understanding.

- The objection raised in the second paragraph is about the limitations of using only Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures.
- The objection does not suggest that cultural values cannot be understood, but rather that the methods used to understand them should not be limited to Western scientific methods.
- Therefore, the critics of the objection would most likely agree with choice E, which suggests that the values of liberalism cannot be understood solely through Western scientific methods.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The second proposal advocates for a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but it still applies Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. They argue that insisting on trying to understand non-scientific cultures by the methods of Western science is an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science.
Thought:
  The critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph argue that Western scientific methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are inadequate for understanding non-scientific cultures.
  They criticize the second proposal for adopting a Western perspective in understanding cultures.
  Therefore, they would most likely agree with the statement that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
  The answer is E.
Criticism:
  The critics in the second paragraph criticize Western scientific methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures, and argue that understanding non-scientific cultures requires adopting their perspectives and methods.
  The statement in option E is related to the argument of the second paragraph, but it is not necessarily the only thing they would agree with.
  Additionally, the critics do not necessarily argue that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science; rather, they argue that non-Western cultures cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")

The passage discusses the relationship between plants and insects, particularly in terms of the secondary chemical substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. It explains how insects have played a major role in the evolution of these substances, and how natural selection has favored substances that either attract pollinating insects or provide a defense against plant-eating insects. The main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.

Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:
The passage discusses:
- The chemical composition of plants, including primary and secondary substances.
- The role of insects in the evolution of secondary substances in plants.
- The ways in which secondary substances in plants operate as defenses against plant-eating insects.
- The competition between plants and plant-eating insects, including the narrowing of the range of suitable food sources for insects.

Thought:
The passage emphasizes the relationship between plants and insects and how this has led to the development of secondary substances in plants. These secondary substances give plants their tastes and smells and have evolved as a result of the interaction between plants and insects. Some secondary substances have arisen as a result of genetic mutations, but only those that aid in the survival of the organism are passed down through natural selection. Insects have played a major role in selecting for secondary substances that act as defenses against them. Over time, this competition has led to a narrowing of the range of suitable food sources for insects. Therefore, the correct answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.

Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes research concerning happiness and wealth, and presents the phenomena of habituation and rivalry as explanations for why richer societies are not necessarily happier societies. The author also argues that happiness depends on how people compare themselves to others.
  Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because the additional money is a sign of success and the creation of value, which is an important human desire. The author also argues against the idea that people primarily care about one-upmanship.
Thought: 
  Both authors are presenting their explanations for why having more money does or does not lead to happiness. They both use evidence to support their arguments. Passage A uses research studies to explain the phenomena of habituation and rivalry, while Passage B argues from an evolutionary perspective. Both authors provide an explanation for what appears to be a paradox – that people report higher levels of happiness when they have more money but as societies become richer, they do not become happier. 
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B attempt to resolve an apparent paradox. The answer is D: attempt to resolve an apparent paradox. 
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence that the authors are explaining the phenomena based on biological origins. While Passage B discusses evolutionary psychology, it is not necessarily focused on biological origins. The authors are not just endorsing a claim simply because it is widely believed. They are both presenting their own arguments and supporting them with evidence. While they both accept certain claims, they do not do so for the sake of argument alone. They use the claims to support their own positions. Lastly, while both authors assert that their positions are supported by data, this is not the main reason why they are both presented in the passages. The main focus is on resolving the paradox of why richer societies are not necessarily happier.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials
  C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial

  B: This answer choice is not a primary focus of the discussion of cognitive framework.
  C: While this may be true, it is not the primary focus of the discussion of cognitive framework.
  D: This answer choice is not a primary focus of the discussion of cognitive framework.
  E: The author discusses creating credibility as a potential reason stealing thunder is effective, but this is not the primary focus of the discussion of cognitive framework.
Thought: 
  The question asks why the author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create. The discussion of cognitive framework suggests that early information can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial. This supports the author's argument that stealing thunder can be effective because it allows a lawyer to frame damaging information in their own terms before the opposition has a chance to frame it negatively. By framing the information positively, the lawyer can create a cognitive framework that jurors will use when evaluating subsequent information. Therefore, the answer is A.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:

Knowledge: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create primarily to explain why stealing thunder may be limited in its effectiveness when the negative information is very damaging. 
A: The author does indicate that information mentioned early in a trial can influence how jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial, but this is not the primary focus of the discussion of cognitive frameworks.
B: The author does mention that jurors bring attitudes and biases into the courtroom that inform their opinions during trials, but this is not the primary focus of the discussion of cognitive frameworks.
C: The author does not suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial. This is not the primary focus of the discussion of cognitive frameworks.
D: The author does not theorize that stealing thunder is best done as early as possible in a case before the opposition has an opportunity to solidify jurors' opinions. This is not the primary focus of the discussion of cognitive frameworks.
E: The author does not speculate that creating credibility in some cases is probably more effective than positively framing very harmful information. This is not the primary focus of the discussion of cognitive frameworks.
Thought: 
  The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create primarily to explain limitations on the effectiveness of stealing thunder when the negative information is very damaging.
  Cognitive framework appears to refer to the way that jurors organize and interpret information presented during a trial.
  The discussion of cognitive frameworks is not about the benefits of stealing thunder or its timing, but rather about the limitations of the technique.
  Therefore, the answer is A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.
Criticism: 
  This analysis is correct.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the attitude of Matthew Arnold toward the aristocratic and middle classes can best be described as one of
Choices:
  A: respect
  B: empathy
  C: indifference
  D: disappointment
  E: scorn

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage presents two versions of multicultural education.
  The second version holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education contends that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value laden.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first because the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
  The argument presented as a criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures.
  If it were to be true that non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, then it would suggest that the second version of multicultural education is not necessarily ineffective.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would be C, that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education, the first of which involves examining other cultures using the methods and values of the majority culture, and the second of which involves adopting a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that the methods of examination are still Western and thus value-laden, and that to understand other cultures, one must adopt their perspectives and methods.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not fundamentally different from the first version, as it still involves using Western methods and perspectives.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to this criticism would be to show that the second version is fundamentally different from the first version.
  Option A does not provide a strong objection because it is not necessary to be a member of a culture to adopt its perspectives and methods.
  Option B does not provide a strong objection because the similarity of value systems among non-Western societies does not address the criticism of Western-centric methods.
  Option C does not provide a strong objection because using one's own value system while studying different cultures does not necessarily lead to a genuine understanding of those cultures.
  Option D is not relevant to the discussion of multicultural education.
  Option E is not a statement, but a general principle that is already assumed in the passage.
  Therefore, none of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal advocates teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture's values of liberalism.
  The second proposal advocates taking a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures and using Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Critics argue that the second proposal is not essentially different from the first, because Western scientific methods are already value-laden.
Thought:
  The passage describes an objection to the second proposal for multicultural education, which is that it is impossible to understand other cultures by using Western scientific methods.
  In order to provide a strong objection to this criticism, we need to show that it is possible to understand other cultures by using Western scientific methods.
  Option A does not provide a strong objection to the criticism, because it only highlights a potential difficulty in adopting the perspectives and methods of another culture.
  Option B is irrelevant to the objection, since it focuses on similarities between non-Western societies rather than the feasibility of using Western scientific methods to understand other cultures.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the objection, since it only states that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying other cultures.
  Option D is not a strong objection to the criticism, because it does not address the issue of using Western scientific methods to understand other cultures.
  Option E is not a strong objection either, because it only emphasizes the importance of genuine understanding, without addressing the issue of Western scientific methods.
  None of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism in the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage presents two versions of multicultural education: one that suggests teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture, and another that suggests adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that it is not essentially different from the first form of multicultural education because it involves examining other cultures through the methods and perspectives of the Western scientific tradition.
Thought: 
  The question is asking which of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. To do so, we need to find an answer that would refute the argument that the methods of the Western scientific tradition are not appropriate for understanding non-Western cultures. 
  A: This answer choice does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, which is that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is not appropriate. 
  B: This answer choice does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education either.
  C: This answer choice suggests that some non-Western societies use their own values to study other cultures. However, this does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education either.
  D: This answer choice addresses an entirely different issue and does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education either.
  E: This answer choice suggests that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for appreciating that culture. This would be a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education because it suggests that adopting the perspectives and methods of non-Western cultures is necessary to achieve genuine understanding of those cultures. 
  Therefore, the answer is E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Criticism: 
  None identified.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education that differ in how they approach the study of other cultures.
  The first version adopts the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture (typically liberal values).
  The second version takes a neutral stance with respect to value differences and adopts Western scientific methods, which are argued to be value-laden.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first because the methods used are still identifiably Western and value-laden.
  To provide the strongest objection to this criticism, we need to find an option that challenges the idea that the second version is not different from the first.
  Option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  This suggests that it is possible to adopt a non-Western perspective when studying other cultures, which would undermine the criticism that the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first.
  Therefore, C provides the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal advocates teaching about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture.
  The second proposal advocates adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and using Western scientific methods to examine cultures.
  Critics argue that both proposals are problematic because they are refracted through a Western lens.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second proposal is that it is not essentially different from the first proposal because it still uses Western scientific methods to examine other cultures.
  The objection to this criticism is that it is possible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture that is being studied, even if one is not a member of that culture.
  This objection would show that the second proposal is different from the first proposal because it allows for the examination of other cultures from within those cultures themselves.
  Therefore, the answer is A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
Criticism: 
  The objection in choice A only addresses one part of the criticism of the second proposal.
  The criticism argues that Western scientific methods are inherently value-laden and thus distort the understanding of non-Western cultures.
  Even if one adopts the perspectives and methods of a culture, they may still be unconsciously influenced by Western values.
  Thus, the objection in choice A is not strong enough to completely refute the criticism of the second proposal.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education. 
  The first version advocates teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values.
  The second version advocates adopting a neutral stance with respect to cultural value differences and using Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that using Western scientific methods is distorting and an attempt to maintain Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Thought:
  The question asks for the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  The criticism is that using Western scientific methods is distorting and an attempt to maintain Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, the strongest objection would be if there is evidence that using Western scientific methods is not distorting in the study of other cultures.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it suggests that adopting the perspectives and methods of a culture is impossible, which is not relevant to the criticism of using Western scientific methods.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it suggests that many non-Western societies have similar value systems, but this does not address the criticism of using Western scientific methods.
  Choice C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures, which is not relevant to the criticism of using Western scientific methods.
  Choice D suggests that understanding Western achievements requires Western scientific investigations, which is not relevant to the criticism of using Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Choice E is not an objection to the criticism of using Western scientific methods, but rather a statement of the importance of understanding another culture.
  Therefore, none of the choices provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version teaches about other cultures through the lens of the majority culture's values.
  The second version takes a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures and uses Western scientific methods to study cultures.
  Critics argue that the Western scientific methods are value-laden and may not lead to genuine understanding of non-Western cultures.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first version because the Western scientific methods are value-laden.
  To refute this criticism, we need to show that the Western scientific methods can lead to genuine understanding of non-Western cultures.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the objection and does not provide any evidence to refute the criticism.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it discusses similarities among non-Western societies, but it is not relevant to the objection.
  Choice C is partially relevant to the objection because it suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying other cultures.
  However, it does not address the issue of whether the Western scientific methods are value-laden and whether they can lead to genuine understanding of non-Western cultures.
  Choice D is not relevant to the objection because it discusses the understanding of Western culture, not non-Western cultures.
  Choice E supports the original criticism that genuine understanding of non-Western cultures is necessary and may not be achieved through Western scientific methods.
  Therefore, Choice C provides the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education, one of which (the second) holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, and the other (the first) holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture.
  Critics of the second version argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that is not value-neutral and that scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures.
Thought:
  The strongest objection to the criticism would be one that undermines the argument that the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first and shows that each culture can be taken on its own terms.
  (A) is irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education and does not address the argument.
  (B) is also irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education and does not address the argument.
  (C) weakens the argument against the second version of multicultural education, but it does not provide the strongest objection to the criticism.
  (D) is irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education and does not address the argument.
  (E) supports the argument against the second version of multicultural education, but it does not provide the strongest objection to the criticism.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education. The first version holds that schools should teach about other cultures, but from the perspective of the majority culture.

Critics of the second version argue that Western scientific methods are value-laden and that to understand non-scientific cultures, one must adopt their perspectives and methods.
Thought: 
The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is impossible to truly understand and appreciate other cultures if one approaches them solely from within Western scientific methods and perspectives. Thus, the strongest objection to this criticism would be the assertion that Western scientific methods and perspectives can provide a genuine understanding of other cultures.
A: This choice is not a strong objection to the criticism because it simply asserts that adopting a culture's perspective and methods is impossible, which supports the critics' argument.
B: This choice is not a strong objection to the criticism because it is about the similarity of value systems among non-Western societies, which is not directly relevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
C: This choice suggests that some non-Western societies do not use Western scientific methods to study other cultures, which is consistent with the second version of multicultural education. Therefore, it is not a strong objection to the criticism of this version.
D: This choice is not a strong objection to the criticism because it is about Western society's understanding of its own achievements, which is not directly relevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
E: This choice is a restatement of the criticism of the second version of multicultural education that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. It is not an objection to the criticism.
Criticism: 
Given that none of the choices provide a strong objection to the criticism, it is difficult to evaluate the logic of the thought process.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the ways in which Schoenberg's music is challenging, but ultimately valuable because of the emotions it can evoke. 
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that what makes Schoenberg's music valuable is that it "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before." 
  Therefore, the best answer will be a comedian whose work also "delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that [comedy] had not recorded before."
  Answer B, a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, is the only answer that suggests a comedian whose work is challenging in a way that is similar to Schoenberg's music. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the controversial nature of Schoenberg's music and how it extended the expressive range of music.
  The passage describes how Schoenberg's music precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. 
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is its ability to distinctly and accurately portray and express emotional states that had not been expressed previously. Therefore, something that could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54 is something that accurately portrays and expresses difficult truths. 
  Among the answer choices, the best match for this is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore. Just as Schoenberg's music specifically delineated disquieting emotional states, the comedian in this answer choice specifically shines a light on aspects of human nature that are difficult to face. 
Criticism: 
  While B is the closest match to the way that Schoenberg's music is described as disturbing, the analogy is not perfect. 
  The passage describes the emotional states Schoenberg's music is able to express with precision. However, the answer choice describes the aspects of human nature that the comedian is able to shine a light on as being something many people would prefer to ignore, indicating that they are not being expressed or portrayed with precision or accuracy. 
  This might suggest that a better answer choice would be one that describes something that accurately portrays and expresses difficult truths, rather than something that people would prefer to ignore. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the controversy surrounding the music of Arnold Schoenberg, which was considered disturbing and incoherent by some listeners.
  The passage also suggests that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that what makes Schoenberg's music disturbing is that it unflinchingly faces difficult truths and explores emotional states that had not been recorded before.
  Therefore, the answer choice that could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54 is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Criticism: 
  There is no specific mention of comedians in the passage, so the analogy between Schoenberg's music and comedy is not explicitly made.
  Additionally, the passage does not indicate that Schoenberg's music is disturbing simply because it explores emotional states that had not been recorded before; rather, it is the precise delineation of those emotional states that makes the music essential.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how Schoenberg's music precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before, which is why some of his work remains disturbing. 
Thought: 
  To be analogous to Schoenberg's music, the disturbing thing should precisely delineate recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that had not been recorded before, such as the way that Schoenberg's music did.
  Option A might be disturbing to some people, but it is not analogous to Schoenberg's music.
  Option B is a possible answer because it also precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that people would prefer to ignore, like Schoenberg's music.
  Option C might be unoriginal or unfunny, but it does not embody the same qualities as Schoenberg's music.
  Option D might be disturbing, but it is not necessarily precisely delineating recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states in the way that Schoenberg's music does.
  Option E might be unfamiliar to the audience, but it does not embody the same qualities as Schoenberg's music.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant criticism to this answer.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the music of Arnold Schoenberg, and how it was controversial due to its innovative and unconventional techniques.
  The author argues that Schoenberg's music is essential because it expresses emotional states that had not been recorded before.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
  The analogy must be something that is disturbing in a similar way.
  Option A refers to a comedian whose humor is vulgar. While this may be disturbing to some, it does not seem to fit the criteria of what makes Schoenberg's music disturbing.
  Option B describes a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature that are often ignored. This could be considered disturbing, but it does not seem to be the most analogous option.
  Option C describes a comedian whose material is composed of material already made famous by other comedians. This may be unoriginal and uninteresting, but it does not seem to fit the criteria of what makes Schoenberg's music disturbing.
  Option D describes a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy. This may be controversial, but it does not seem to fit the criteria of what makes Schoenberg's music disturbing.
  Option E describes a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience. This may be unsettling or uncomfortable, but it does not seem to fit the criteria of what makes Schoenberg's music disturbing.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the controversial nature of the music of Arnold Schoenberg and acknowledges that some people find his music disturbing. 
Thought: 
  The passage describes Schoenberg as "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before." 
  Therefore, something that is disturbing in a similar way to Schoenberg's music might be something that also delves into and explores difficult and previously unexamined emotional states. 
  Option B, a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, could be seen as analogous to Schoenberg's music in this way. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage discusses how Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it "delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before." The passage also mentions that Schoenberg's music became more difficult to follow as it progressed. 
A: This choice describes a comedian whose humor relies heavily upon vulgar humor, but it does not describe anything that is analogous to the way in which Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
B: This choice describes a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore. This could be seen as analogous to Schoenberg's music, which also explores emotional states that had not been explored before.
C: This choice describes a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians. This does not describe anything that is analogous to the way in which Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
D: This choice describes a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy. This does not describe anything that is analogous to the way in which Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
E: This choice describes a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience. This does not describe anything that is analogous to the way in which Schoenberg's music is disturbing. 
Thought: 
  The passage describes how Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it explores emotional states that had not been explored before. 
  Choice B describes a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
  This seems like an analogous situation, as both are disturbing in their exploration of the unknown or unexplored. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Criticism: 
  There could be other choices that are also analogous to the way in which Schoenberg's music is disturbing. 
  However, given the choices presented, B is the best answer. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is discussing the controversial nature of Arnold Schoenberg's music and its ability to express previously unrecorded emotional states.
Thought: 
  To answer this question, we must find a comparison to Schoenberg's music that is "disturbing not because it is incoherent, shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths." 
  Option A, a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor, is not a good comparison because that type of humor does not necessarily face difficult truths.
  Option B, a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, is a good comparison because it is also about facing difficult truths, even if it may not be as dissonant as Schoenberg's music.
  Option C, a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians, is not a good comparison because it does not relate to disturbing truths.
  Option D, a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy, is not a good comparison because it does not relate to disturbing truths in the same way Schoenberg's music does.
  Option E, a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience, is not a good comparison because unfamiliarity does not necessarily equate to facing difficult truths.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about the music of Arnold Schoenberg - a composer who stirred controversy because of the way he altered the language and extended the expressive range of music.
  The author suggests that despite the fact that Schoenberg's music was considered disturbing by many, it was essential because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
Thought:
  The passage describes Schoenberg's music as disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths and records emotional states that were previously unknown to music.
  Based on this line of reasoning, a comedian whose humor similarly unflinchingly faces difficult truths and exposes aspects of human nature that people would prefer to ignore could also be considered disturbing in a way that is analogous to Schoenberg's music.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Criticism:
  One could argue that the author's description of Schoenberg's music as disturbing is subjective and therefore difficult to compare to other forms of art or entertainment.
  Additionally, the analogy between Schoenberg's music and a comedian's humor may not hold up under closer inspection since the two forms of expression are drastically different from one another.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the evolution of music through the works of Beethoven and Schoenberg. 
  Schoenberg's music is described as sometimes disturbing but essential because it expresses new emotional states that music had not recorded before. 
  The passage does not discuss comedians or humor. 
Thought:
  Schoenberg's music is described as disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths. 
  Something analogous to this might be a comedian who also unflinchingly faces difficult truths, rather than relying on cheap jokes or unoriginal material. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.

Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture

  Therefore, choice C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage differentiates between two proposals of multicultural education that attempt to teach about other cultures.
  The first proposal is that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, but with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture.
  The second proposal is that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still use Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures, such as those of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures and that the methods used to study other cultures are already value-laden.
Thought: 
  We are asked to identify what would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in paragraph three.
  Paragraph three discusses the second proposal of multicultural education that adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and uses Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures, such as those of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology.
  Critics of this proposal argue that scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures and that the methods used to study other cultures are already value-laden.

  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal advocates teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture, using the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture.
  Critics of the first proposal argue that this approach distorts understanding of other cultures.
  The second proposal advocates a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures, but still uses Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that these methods are already value-laden and distort the understanding of non-Western cultures.
Thought:
  The proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph argue that understanding of other cultures can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  Therefore, they would most likely object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
  The answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education: 
    - The first version teaches about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values.
    - The second version attempts to take a neutral stance toward cultural differences but still relies on Western scientific methods.
    - Critics of the second version argue that using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures is not an adequate approach.
Thought: 
  The proponents of the second version of multicultural education aim to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. They argue that each culture should be taken on its own terms. 
  The passage suggests that proponents of the second version of multicultural education would object to the use of Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture, which is an approach used in the first version of multicultural education. 
  Therefore, the most objectionable study for proponents of the second version would be the one that employed the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture. 
  Choice C describes this kind of study, so the answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism: 
  This interpretation of the passage is correct. There is no apparent reason why proponents of the second version of multicultural education would object to any of the other studies described in the answer choices.

Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal advocates for teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture's methods and values.
  The second proposal advocates for adopting a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures but still using Western methods of examination, study, and explanation.
  Critics of these proposals argue that the methods of the majority culture are distorting and do not allow for genuine understanding of other cultures.
Thought:
  The proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph believe that true understanding of other cultures can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  Therefore, they would likely find objectionable the idea of studying a nonscientific culture using the methods of Western science, as this approach is seen as distorting and maintaining a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Choice C suggests exactly this scenario, so it is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.
  D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  E: "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed someone not from the Border region.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes corridos, a type of narrative folk song from the Lower Rio Grande Border region.
  Corridos have been part of a long-standing ballad tradition with roots in eighteenth-century Spain.
  Corridos commemorate significant local happenings and affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities.
  Corridos are composed of familiar images and certain ready-made lines, such as the despedida.
Thought:
  The passage describes corridos as being sung at social gatherings to commemorate significant local happenings and to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities.
  The passage also describes corridos as being composed of certain ready-made lines, such as the despedida.
  Since the despedida is a set convention, it is possible that most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide enough information to support the inference that most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  The passage only states that the despedida is a set convention and that the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished in the despedida.
  Therefore, the answer is not D.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the history and characteristics of the corrido, a type of narrative folk song, that originated from the Lower Rio Grande Border region. 
  Corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs and have roots in eighteenth-century Spain. 
  Corridos deal with subject matter specific to the Border region and often commemorate significant local happenings.
  Corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments, and use familiar linguistic and thematic conventions to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. 
  The formal closing verse, or despedida, is a set convention in corridos.
Thought: 
  The passage describes the corrido as a type of narrative folk song that is sung at social gatherings to commemorate significant local happenings. 
  The corridos deal with subject matter specific to the Border region and use familiar linguistic and thematic conventions to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. 
  The corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida, is a set convention.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that most corridos have some lines in common, and most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  Option C and D both seem to be correct, but D is a more specific version of C, so the answer is D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
Criticism: 
  There is no support in the passage for inferring that "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings or that "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed by someone not from the Border region.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the history and characteristics of corridos, a type of narrative folk song from the Lower Rio Grande Border.
  Corridos combine formal features of different types of folk songs and deal with subject matter specific to the Border region.
  Corridos use familiar linguistic and thematic conventions to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities.
  Corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments, and rarely use metaphors, except for everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners.
  Corridos have certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another, such as the formal closing verse or despedida.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the formal features and conventions of corridos, including the despedida.
  The despedida has a set convention for the first and third lines and variable lines for the second and fourth, with the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject.
  Therefore, most corridos probably have the same despedida structure with some variable lines.
  The passage does not provide any information to support the other answer choices.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
Criticism: 
  There is no information in the passage to support the claim that "Most corrido variants have the same despedida."
  While the passage describes the formal closing verse or despedida of corridos, it does not state that most corridos share the same despedida structure.
  Therefore, the answer may not be completely accurate.

  Corridos are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain.
  Corridos are sung in Spanish.
  Corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region.
  Corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings and affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities.
  Corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments.
  Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos.
  The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another.
Thought: 
  The passage talks about the traditional elements of corridos.
  It discusses the despedida, the closing verse that has a set convention.
  The despedida of some variants of "Gregorio Cortez" includes the name of the corrido or expresses its subject.
  The first and third lines of the despedida are a set convention, while the second and fourth vary according to exigencies of rhyme.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that most corrido variants have a different despedida.
  The passage implies nothing about the frequency of singing "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" at Border social gatherings, so option A is not correct.
  The passage says that "El Corrido de Kiansis" is the oldest surviving corrido in complete form. Therefore, option E is incorrect.
  While the passage implies that some corridos do not exist in complete form, it does not support the inference that "most" do not exist in complete form. Therefore, option B is incorrect.
  The passage mentions that corridos have standard generic elements, including certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. However, it does not say that ALL complete corridos have some lines in common, so option C is incorrect.
Criticism: 
  The passage implies that the despedida varies from one corrido variant to another but does not provide sufficient information to support the inference that "most corrido variants have a different despedida." This answer choice is a bit too extreme.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the corrido, a type of narrative folk song from the Lower Rio Grande Border region.
  Corridos flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s and are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain.
  Corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region.
  Corridos are sung in Spanish and take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow.
  Corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments, and rely on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions.
  The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another, including a formal closing verse, or despedida.
Thought: 
  The passage describes the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida, which is a set convention.
  The despedida consists of four lines, with the first and third lines being a set convention, while the second and fourth lines are variable.
  The fourth line carries the name of the corrido or expresses its subject, and the second line varies according to exigencies of rhyme.
  Therefore, most corridos probably have the same despedida.
  The passage does not provide any evidence to suggest that "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings, that most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form, that all complete corridos have some lines in common, or that "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed by someone not from the Border region.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans caused by a pathogen called a prion.
  Prions are a new type of protein pathogen that do not contain nucleic acid in their cellular structure.
  The abnormal conformation of prions induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves, causing a cascade reaction that ultimately destroys nerve cells.
Thought:
  The author would be least likely to agree with a statement that contradicts information presented in the passage.
  A: The passage discusses how the abnormal conformation of prions leads to the destruction of nerve cells, causing dementia, which supports the idea that the presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease. So, the author would not least likely agree with choice A.
  B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. The passage does not suggest that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease. So, the author would likely agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: The passage discusses how prions lack nucleic acid in their cellular structure and reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, through a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. So, the author would agree that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The passage describes how prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. In the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal. So, the author would agree that the body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: The passage discusses how the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood. So, the author would likely agree that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
  Therefore, the statement the author would be LEAST likely to agree with is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.

  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans caused by prions.
  Prions are a new type of protein pathogen that reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and to produce a plaque that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.
Thought: 
  The author is least likely to agree with something that contradicts what is presented in the passage.
  A: The passage explicitly states that abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue are a sign of neurological disease, so the author would agree with this statement.
  B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, so the author would not agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: The passage states that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction, so the author would agree with this statement.
  D: The passage states that because prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present, so the author would agree that the body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: The passage states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood, so the author would agree with this statement.
  Therefore, the author is least likely to agree with statement B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism: 
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, so it is unlikely that the author would agree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease. 
  However, it is possible that the author would not strongly disagree with this statement because there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  CJD is caused by a pathogen called a prion, which is a protein-based pathogen lacking nucleic acid.
  Prions are able to reproduce in an unexpected way by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation, resulting in the destruction of nerve cells.
Thought:
  The author believes in the existence of prions, a protein-based pathogen, as a new class of infectious pathogens.
  The author describes CJD as inevitably fatal and that the body does not produce an immune response against prions.
  Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  The answer is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the passage to support the idea that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease. 
  On the contrary, the passage mentions that CJD is inevitably fatal and that there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans caused by a protein pathogen called a prion.
  The prion lacks nucleic acid and reproduces itself by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Unlike other pathogens, prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, so the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
Thought: 
  The author is least likely to agree with B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease because the passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal.
Criticism: 
  There is no information in the passage that suggests that any patients infected with CJD will recover from the disease, so B cannot be inferred in any way.
  Answer E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce is also not something the author would be least likely to agree with based on the passage. In fact, the passage clearly states that "the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood." 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a degenerative form of dementia that causes brain damage.
  CJD is caused by prions, which are protein pathogens that reproduce by initiating a chain reaction that induces non-pathogenic prions to transform themselves.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues.
  Prions lack nucleic acid and reproduce differently than traditional pathogens.
  The body does not produce an immune response to prions.
Thought:
  The passage discusses how prions reproduce and cause CJD, as well as how prions differ from other pathogens.
  A: The passage describes how prions cause neurological disease, so the author would likely agree with this statement.
  B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, so the author would not agree with this statement.
  C: The passage describes how prions reproduce without nucleic acid, so the author would likely agree with this statement.
  D: The passage states that the body does not produce an immune response to prions, so the author would likely agree with this statement.
  E: The passage acknowledges that scientists have an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms by which prions reproduce, so the author would likely agree with this statement.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism:
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, so the statement in option B is directly contradicted by the text.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

Thought: 
  A: The waiter conceals his tip income to reduce his taxes because he believes it is unlikely that he will be detected and punished. This is a rational response to economic incentives.
  B: The motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road to avoid losing her driver's license because she knows it is heavily patrolled. This is a rational response to disincentives.
  C: The industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine. This is a rational response to economic incentives.
  D: The government official risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. This is a rational response to economic incentives.
  E: The worker physically assaults his former supervisor because he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This is not a rational response to economic incentives.
  Therefore, the least appropriate response to economic incentives and disincentives would be E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Criticism: 
  The economic principle of utility maximization only applies to rational decision-making based on the expected utility of an action. The worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor is not based on rational economic incentives or disincentives, but rather on an emotional response to a perceived injustice. Therefore, it is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.

Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style was late-Romantic music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  The third style developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
Thought: 
  The author notes that Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory.
  The author also praises Schoenberg's technical mastery and his ability to delineate recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  The author does not explicitly state their opinion about the relationships between the three styles.
  However, the author notes that the first style was similar to the music of Brahms, indicating that it was not a radical departure from tradition.
  The author also notes that Schoenberg viewed the second style as the next inevitable step in the historical development of music.
  Finally, the author notes that the third style brought a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilized it.
  Based on this information, it seems likely that the author would agree with choice D: The second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Schoenberg worked in three different musical styles.
  His music evolved from late-Romantic manner to atonal music without a tonal basis to 12-tone technique.
  In all three styles, he operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery.
Thought:
  The author discusses the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The author explains how Schoenberg pushed unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis and developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
  Thus, each style can be seen as a natural progression towards the next style, with Schoenberg constantly evolving his music.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the three musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style is late-Romantic, charged with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style pushed unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  The third style developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
Thought: 
  The passage notes that Schoenberg worked in constantly changing and evolving musical styles that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously exploring new territory.
  Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery in all three styles.
  The real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would be most likely to believe that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  This is because Schoenberg pushed the unstable harmonies of the first style until they no longer had a tonal basis in the second style and developed the 12-tone technique to bring a new system of order to nontonal music in the third style.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the two ways in which art was produced for political and social elites historically: commissioning an artist to create something or creating a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always produced art that endures. 
  Some artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment or produce art that went against the grain of elite values.
  Sociohistorical critics analyze how art embodied the ideology of the elite, but this analysis must take into account the possibility of artists subverting the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.
Thought:
  The passage discusses two ways in which art was produced for the political and social elites.
  It also discusses the fact that artistic expression did not always align with the tastes of the elite, which could result in artists finding a place in the margins of the establishment.
  Finally, it touches on the work done by sociohistorical critics to analyze how art embodies the ideology of the elite and the difficulties in doing so.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that there have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them, and that sociohistorical criticism of this art must take into account the complexities of the relationship between the artist and patron.
  The answer is E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them. 
Criticism:
  This is the most accurate summary of the passage, encompassing all of the details discussed.
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the ways in which art has been commissioned and produced historically, as well as the challenges of interpreting the motives and values of the patrons and artists involved.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?

  The phrase that best conveys this attitude is "failed to address."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The passage provides an overview of early Native American modes of autobiographical expression and contrasts them with the more familiar European tradition of autobiographical writing. The author also critiques earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies for focusing too narrowly on written, bicultural life histories that were solicited, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators. 
Thought: 
The question asks for the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies. The author is critical of this earlier scholarship for its narrow focus on written documents produced through bicultural composite authorship. The author suggests that such scholarship has overlooked traditional modes of autobiographical expression and cultural constructs that differ significantly from European assumptions about self, life, and writing. 
A. "Failed to address" suggests that the earlier scholarship lacked something important, which is accurate based on the author's critique of the narrow focus on written documents. This could be the best answer.
B. "Highly diverse" describes Native American peoples, not the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
C. "Markedly inclusive" describes pre-contact Native American cultures, not the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
D. "Seemingly more fragmented" describes the mode of autobiography used in some pre-contact Native American cultures, not the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
E. "Alien to the European style" describes the intercultural collaboration involved in pre-contact Native American modes of autobiographical expression, not the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
Criticism: 
While A is the best answer, it could be argued that the phrase "failed to address" suggests a more neutral tone than the author's critique actually conveys. The author is not simply pointing out a lack of attention to traditional modes of autobiographical expression, but rather is arguing that earlier scholarship has overlooked important aspects of Native American cultures and has failed to recognize the limitations of European assumptions about self, life, and writing. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism
  D: admiration for its subtle critique of contemporary culture
  E: appreciation for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage argues that the ideas of increasing returns to scale and the invisible hand are opposed to each other.
  The pin factory example shows the benefits of increased size in terms of increased specialization and productivity, but increased returns to scale can lead to monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The author argues that the connection between increased size and monopoly power exists because of increasing returns to scale.
  If it can be shown that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopoly power, it would undermine the argument.
  Option A suggests that larger businesses do not always hold monopoly power, which undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Options B, C, D, and E do not address the issue of monopoly power.
  Therefore, the best answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory describes the benefits of increased specialization and size in business.
  The Invisible Hand refers to the idea that self-interest can lead to the common good in a competitive marketplace.
  Increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry.
Thought: 
  The article suggests that the connection between increased size and monopoly power is a result of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, something that undermines the assumption of increasing returns to scale would weaken the connection between size and monopoly power.
  Choice D suggests that the size required to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, which would mean that not all large businesses would necessarily have monopoly power.
  Therefore, D is the best answer.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand as two opposing concepts in economics.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes increasing returns to scale, where larger firms can produce more efficiently than smaller firms.
  The Invisible Hand emphasizes a competitive marketplace with many competitors in order to prevent monopolies and promote self-interest for the common good.
Thought:
  The author argues that the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand are opposed to each other.
  If there are increasing returns to scale, then larger firms can produce more efficiently and potentially drive smaller firms out of business, leading to monopolies.
  The Invisible Hand requires many competitors in order to prevent monopolies and promote self-interest for the common good.
  Therefore, if there is evidence that larger firms do not necessarily lead to monopolies, this would undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice A suggests that in some industries, businesses can exert monopoly power in one region even if there are larger businesses in the industry in other regions.
  This does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it still suggests that larger businesses have an advantage over smaller ones.
  Choice B and E discuss the impact of specialization on workers and productivity, but do not address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice C suggests that businesses collude to set prices, but this is not necessarily related to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice D suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, which suggests that there may be other factors at play beyond just size.
  This undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it suggests that other factors may be more important than size in determining whether a business becomes a monopoly.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Monopoly power undermines the idea that free markets can harness self-interest to the common good.
  The invisible hand works effectively only when there are many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The author suggests that the invisible hand works effectively only when there are many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  A: This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It actually supports it by acknowledging that there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  C: This statement supports the author's argument that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  D: This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It actually supports the idea that the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It actually supports the author's argument that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The most relevant statement is A, but it does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. Therefore, none of the statements undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the contradiction inherent in economic theory since Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations in 1776.
  According to Smith, increased size can lead to increased efficiency in producing goods through specialization of labor.
  However, increasing returns to scale can also lead to natural tendency toward monopoly.
Thought: 
  The author argues that free markets rely on the assumption of diminishing returns, which prevents the natural tendency toward monopoly.
  However, if some industries require larger businesses to achieve increasing returns to scale than others, the connection between increased size and monopoly power may not be as strong as the author suggests.
  Therefore, D may undermine the author's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The author argues that increasing returns to scale creates a natural tendency towards monopoly because large firms can achieve lower costs than small firms and there is a lack of competition. The author also notes that for the invisible hand to work properly, there needs to be many competitors in each industry so that no one can exert monopoly power.
A: This statement suggests that there are some smaller businesses in certain regions that have a monopoly, which implies that monopoly power is not necessarily connected to increasing returns to scale. However, this statement does not undermine the connection between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power in general.
B: This statement is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
C: This statement reinforces the idea that larger firms can exert monopoly power, but it does not undermine the connection between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
D: This statement challenges the idea that there is a direct connection between increased size and monopoly power. It suggests that just because a business is large does not mean it will necessarily dominate its industry. This weakens the author's argument that increasing returns to scale inevitably lead to monopoly power.
E: This statement suggests that there are limits to how specialized workers can be before other factors offset the gains in productivity achieved by specialization. This implies that there are limits to the increasing returns to scale that can be achieved. However, it does not directly undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Thought:
Option D challenges the underlying assumption that increasing returns to scale inevitably lead to monopoly power. If there is no direct connection between increased size and monopoly power, then the author's argument is weakened.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses the tension between the Pin Factory, which emphasizes the efficiency gains from specialization and increased scale, and the Invisible Hand, which requires a competitive market with many competitors to function properly.
Thought:
  The Pin Factory can lead to larger businesses and, if there are increasing returns to scale, a natural tendency towards monopoly power.
  The Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry to prevent the exertion of monopoly power.
  Therefore, if there is evidence that increasing scale does not necessarily lead to monopoly power, this undermines the connection drawn between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice A describes such a situation, where some businesses have monopoly power in one region but not in others, despite being larger than competitors in those other regions.
  Thus, Choice A is the correct answer.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopoly and undermine the competition in the market.
Thought:
If there are some other factors that undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, then the argument made by the author would be weakened.
A: The fact that some businesses are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region does not necessarily undermine the connection between the increasing size of businesses and natural monopoly.
B: The argument made by the author is not about the salary of workers, but rather about the relationship between increased size and natural monopoly.
C: The fact that larger businesses collude to set prices does not undermine the argument made by the author.
D: This statement seems to support the idea that natural monopoly can occur in some industries and not in others. However, it does not directly undermine the argument made by the author.
E: If the gains in productivity achieved by making workers more specialized are offset by other factors, then this could undermine the connection between increasing size and natural monopoly. However, this statement does not directly challenge the author's argument.
Criticism:
None of the options seem to directly undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in the context of economic theory.
  The Pin Factory shows how specialization and increased size can lead to greater efficiency and production.
  The Invisible Hand describes how a market economy can harness self-interest to promote the common good.
  The Pin Factory's emphasis on increasing returns to scale creates a natural tendency towards monopoly, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The author argues that the Pin Factory's emphasis on increasing returns to scale is incompatible with the Invisible Hand's requirement for many competitors in each industry.
  Any evidence that suggests that increased size does not necessarily lead to monopoly power would undermine this argument.
  Choice A is the most likely to undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. If there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one region despite larger businesses in other regions, then the size of the business may not be the main factor in producing monopoly power. 
  Choices B, C, D, and E do not directly address the relationship between increased size and monopoly power, and therefore, are less likely to undermine the author's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the inherent contradiction in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  Smith's Pin Factory example highlights the increase in efficiency that can be achieved through increased size and specialization.
  But increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency towards monopoly, as bigger firms tend to drive smaller ones out of business.
  The Invisible Hand relies on the assumption of diminishing returns so that there can be many competitors in each industry.
Thought: 
  The article argues that increasing returns to scale can create a natural tendency towards monopoly, which undermines the idea of the Invisible Hand.
  Therefore, anything that undermines the connection between size and monopoly power will weaken the author's argument.
  A: This statement describes a scenario where smaller businesses are able to exert monopoly power in certain regions, but it doesn't necessarily undermine the connection between size and monopoly power.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument being made about the connection between size and monopoly power.
  C: This statement reinforces the idea that larger businesses tend to exert monopoly power, which supports the author's argument.
  D: This statement suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns to scale varies by industry, but it doesn't undermine the connection between size and monopoly power.
  E: This statement suggests that there may be offsetting costs to increasing specialization, which could weaken the connection between size and increased efficiency.
Criticism: 
  The article argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency towards monopoly, so any statement that suggests otherwise would weaken the author's argument.
  Choice A doesn't really address the issue of increasing returns to scale, so it's not a strong answer.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument being made.
  Choice C reinforces the idea that larger businesses tend to exert monopoly power, so it actually supports the author's argument.
  Choice D doesn't undermine the connection between size and monopoly power, so it's not a strong answer.
  Choice E does suggest that there may be offsetting costs to increasing specialization, but it's not clear if this is enough to undermine the connection between size and increased efficiency.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society
  E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on realism and art.
  A: Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the individual and that there was no clear distinction between reality and fantasy.
  B: While Dostoyevsky did not agree with the radical critics' view of literature's role in promoting social change, the passage does not mention that he believed realism was unequal to the task of representing political views.
  C: The passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky believed art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality.
  D: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky did not agree with the radical critics' view that literature should explicitly expose social inequities and create a new society, but it does not say that he believed realism was ineffective in facilitating social critique.
  E: While Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source of literature, he also believed that a work of art could go beyond reality and that reality was not limited to the tangible.
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky took a realist position on literature.
  He believed that reality was shaped by individual experience and that there was no clear distinction between reality and fantasy.
  He did not believe that literature should be explicitly political or serve a particular social agenda.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a work of art should stand or fall on its artistic merit, which he defined as the ability to express thoughts through characters and images so that readers could fully understand the author's thoughts.
  Dostoyevsky did not believe that art had to be useful to be valuable.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky's disagreement with the radical critics' view of realism was not that he believed realism was ineffective, but rather that he believed that realism alone was not sufficient to capture the full range of human experience.
  A better choice is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
Criticism:
  The thought process correctly identifies that Dostoyevsky believed reality was shaped by individual experience and that he did not believe that literature should be explicitly political or serve a particular social agenda.
  However, the thought process does not explicitly state that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view that realism could expose social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on realism in literature and how it differs from the radical critics' view.
  A: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that reality is deeply shaped by personal experience.
  B: The passage does not directly address whether or not realism can or should represent political views.
  C: The passage states that Dostoyevsky believed in the importance of reality as a source for literature.
  D: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that the radical critics' view of realism was too limiting, but it does not suggest that he thought realism was ineffective at exposing social inequities or contributing to a new society.
  E: The passage does mention that Dostoyevsky believed reality was the crucial source of literature.
Thought:
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's position as a realist who believed that reality was the crucial source of literature.
  The passage also describes how Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism, specifically their demand for literature to be useful and their belief that reality should be depicted "as it is."
  Therefore, it seems likely that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism because he believed that reality was more complex and subjective than they acknowledged.
  Answer choice A most closely aligns with this reasoning.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but he also believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it and that reality was far more than the merely tangible. 
  He believed that a literary work must stand on its "artistic merit." 
  He disagreed with the radical critics' requirements that art must be useful to people and society and that art must serve a particular political view.
Thought: 
  According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature. 
  The passage describes that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was not independent of the experiences of individuals and that reality was far more than the merely tangible. 
  He also believed that a literary work must stand on its "artistic merit" and that art should not be required to be useful to people and society or serve a particular political view. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
Criticism: 
  There is no discussion in the passage about Dostoyevsky's view of realism in literature. 
  Therefore, while the other choices are incorrect, A is not the best answer since it does not accurately reflect Dostoyevsky's disagreement with the radical critics' view of realism.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- There were two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time: one maintained that art should stand above the present and the everyday, while the radical view believed that art should be useful, find its sources in concrete reality, and contribute to the creation of a new society.
- Dostoyevsky took a third position that went deeper than the radical view, where there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.

- He believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
- He believed that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance was a contradiction in terms and that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals.
- There is no evidence in the passage that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed that reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals, or that realism is unequal to the task of representing political views, or that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality, or that realism does not facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
- Therefore, the best answer is E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature.
Criticism:
- While Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, he did not say that reality is not the crucial source of successful literature. In fact, the passage states that "As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source."
- The best answer is likely A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals, since Dostoevsky believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on literature and reality.
  A: Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the individual's experiences.
  B: Dostoyevsky did not agree with the radical critics' view that art should serve a particular political view.
  C: Dostoyevsky did not believe that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality.
  D: Dostoyevsky did not think that realism could expose social inequities or contribute to a new society.
  E: Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source of successful literature.
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  He believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Reality was far more than the tangible and was shaped by individual experiences.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky did not agree with the radical critics' view of realism in literature.
  This is because the radical critics believed that literature had a right to exist only if it was based on concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky thought that this was too limiting and that a writer's task was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Dostoyevsky believed that literature stood or fell on its artistic merit and that artistry was the ability to write well.
  He did not think that literature should be useful to people and society at all costs.
  This is because we cannot know with assurance what will show itself to be useful.
  Additionally, a work of art may not appear useful initially but may eventually become so.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky thought that literature should not be limited to serving a particular political view or narrow definition of reality.
  The correct answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
Criticism:
  The thought process is correct.
  The only minor flaw is that the answer choice should have used the word "independent" instead of "crucial."
  This is because Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source of successful literature.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position with regards to literary criticism.
  He was a realist who believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  He believed that reality was deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed that "reality" was shaped by the person who experienced it, and that reality was far more than the merely tangible. For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit." The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky. Therefore, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed that realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
  The answer is D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
Criticism: 
  There is no clear evidence in the passage that Dostoyevsky believed that realism is unequal to the task of representing political views. In fact, he did not find it useful for literature to be assigned a particular political view. Also, while it is true that Dostoyevsky believed that art should not be elevated above the portrayal of reality, this is not the reason why he disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's view on the purpose and role of literature.
  A: The passage states that reality is shaped by the person who experiences it, and that the boundaries of reality should be exploded. Dostoyevsky saw no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  B: The passage does not mention Dostoyevsky's views on realism's ability to represent political views.
  C: The passage does not state that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality.
  D: The passage states that Dostoyevsky believed that the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless. He believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and that reality was far more than the merely tangible. He did not believe that literature should be useful in a specific political sense.
  E: The passage describes Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality as a crucial source of literature, but also notes that reality is not limited to the tangible, and that reality is shaped by the person who experiences it.
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  Dostoyevsky did not believe that literature should be useful in a specific political sense.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism because he believed that realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
  The answer is D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
Criticism:
  The answer is not entirely accurate. While it is true that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism, he did so for different reasons than those stated in choice D. He did not believe that literature should be useful in a specific political sense, but he also did not believe that literature could facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society. Rather, he believed that literature should be judged on its artistic merit and that the boundaries of reality should be exploded.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on literary realism and its relationship to the fantastic.
  A: Dostoyevsky believed that reality is shaped by the individual's experience of it.
  B: Dostoyevsky did not believe that literature should serve a particular political view.
  C: Dostoyevsky did not believe that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality.
  D: Dostoyevsky did not believe that realism necessarily facilitated the exposure of social inequities or contributed to a new society.
  E: Dostoyevsky believed that reality was a crucial source of successful literature.
Thought: 
  The passage states that Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the radical critics', as he believed that reality was not independent of the individual's experience of it.
  He also believed that the radical critics' requirement that literature be useful to a particular political view was unsatisfactory.
  Dostoyevsky believed that successful literature required artistic merit, which involved the ability to write well and express the author's thoughts through characters and images.
  Therefore, the answer is not C or E, as Dostoyevsky did believe that literature should portray reality and that reality was a crucial source of successful literature.
  The answer is also not B, as Dostoyevsky did not believe that literature should serve a particular political view.
  The answer is Dostoyevsky believed that realism did not necessarily facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to a new society. 
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism.
  While Dostoyevsky believed that reality was not independent of the individual's experience of it, this does not necessarily conflict with a realist view of literature.
  However, the passage does suggest that Dostoyevsky had a more expansive view of reality that included the fantastic, which may be seen as a departure from strict realism.
Action: Answer("D")

However, the passage also notes that Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source.
Thought: 
  According to the passage, Dostoyevsky's opposition to the radical critics' view of realism was not based on the idea that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality, or that realism does not facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society. Instead, Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. He thought that the radical critics' requirement that art must be "useful" to people and society was unsatisfactory because we cannot know what will show itself to be useful. Dostoyevsky also believed that artistry was the ability to write well and that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit.
  Therefore, the answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals. 
Criticism: 
  There is no significant flaw in the thoughts presented. The answer accurately reflects Dostoyevsky's views on realism in literature as described in the passage.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the political diversity and activism of the Mexican American Generation in the United States between 1930 and 1960.
  Garcia argues that this group was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized, and anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s.
  The passage identifies two flaws in Garcia's study: (1) his analysis of evidence to demonstrate political diversity is not consistent; (2) he may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the complexity of Mexican American political history since 1930, characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.
  It is unclear how far the outlook of Mexican American activists extended beyond their own ranks.
  Garcia argues that a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared between 1930 and 1960, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor, but it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists.
  Therefore, it is difficult to conclude definitively that variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  However, Garcia notes that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased. This suggests that an increase in the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States may have contributed to an increase in ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the political diversity and representation of Mexican Americans in the United States between 1930 and 1960.
Thought:
  The passage argues that without a better understanding of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  The passage does not support the idea that ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  The passage does not support the idea that ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  The passage does not support the idea that ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  The passage suggests that the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large may account for variations in ethnic consciousness, but this is not the main point of the passage.
  The passage suggests that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Mexican American Generation and its political diversity.
  Garcia argues that this group was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized and that there was an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences.
  The passage notes that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.
  Garcia argues that a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
  It notes that Garcia argues that the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States between 1930 and 1960 resulted in a new generation of Mexican American leaders who were more politically active.
  However, the passage raises concerns about whether this outlook extended beyond these activists.
  The passage suggests that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization and patterns of assimilation may contribute to variations in ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, the passage supports the statement that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's success in bringing African American dance techniques into North American and European choreography. 
  Dunham was a pioneer in the field of dance ethnology, conducting research into traditional Caribbean dance forms and their origins in African culture.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from prevailing methodology at the time, as she participated in the dances herself rather than observing from a detached position. 
Thought:
  The colleagues mentioned in line 33 advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing due to the extreme physical demands and because they believed effective data gathering required complete detachment.
  Dunham, however, participated in the dances herself and believed that prolonged immersion in the dances allowed her to comprehend them as complex cultural practices.
  The author implies that Dunham's approach was successful in bringing African American dance techniques into the mainstream, which suggests that the colleagues' advice may have been flawed.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound
  C: the royalties paid to authors by their publisbers
  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
  E: the total sales ofa book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the economic efficiency and convenience offered by digital publishing and how it is likely to replace traditional publishing in the future.
  The author mentions that digital publication eliminates costs such as warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and retail stores, displaying physical books, and returning unsold books to publishers.
Thought: 
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to the costs mentioned by the author that are eliminated by digital publishing.
  These costs include warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and retail stores, displaying physical books, and returning unsold books to publishers.
  Therefore, the answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Criticism: 
  The answer choice D is incorrect. While the costs of retail trade in traditional printed books are part of the expenses eliminated by digital publishing, the phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to a larger range of costs that are eliminated, not just retail trade costs.
  The other answer choices, A, B, C, and E, are also not correct as they are not mentioned or relevant to the discussion of the phrase "whole categories of expense."
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author is discussing a shift from traditional publishing to digital publishing.
  The author argues that digital publishing eliminates certain costs associated with traditional publishing.
Thought: 
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to costs that are irrelevant to digital publication.
  The author lists some of these costs in the previous sentence: "eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers." 
  Therefore, the answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Criticism: 
  The answer choice B: the price paid to have books printed and bound could also be considered "whole categories of expense" that are eliminated under digital publishing, as the author mentions in the preceding sentence.
  However, the following sentence clarifies that "traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions" in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors, suggesting that the elimination of printing costs is not the primary focus of the author's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is still most likely D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The author is discussing the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of a new digital model of publishing.
- Digital publishing would eliminate many costs involved in traditional publishing such as warehousing, shipping, and displaying physical books in retail stores.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems with jury nullification, including the unknown frequency of its use, insufficient evidence, and the fact that juries are not legislators.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful function, helping to indicate to the legislature that there may be a problem with a law in question, and that it is unlikely that instances of nullification due to biases are common. It also argues that juries can act as a safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous.
Thought: 
  The authors of the passages may disagree over whether jury nullification is a problem or a useful function.
  Passage A argues that jury nullification is problematic because it creates uncertainty, juries may be biased or lack evidence, and the jury is not a legislature.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be useful because it can indicate to the legislature that there may be a problem with a law in question and that instances of nullification due to biases are unlikely to be common.
  Therefore, the authors may disagree over whether jury nullification is a problem or a useful function.
  None of the choices directly relates to this disagreement.
Criticism: 
  While it is possible that the authors of the passages disagree over whether jury nullification is a problem or a useful function, this is not an explicit point of contention between them. 
  None of the choices directly addresses the disagreement between the authors.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the potential problems with jury nullification, including the fact that juries are not required to explain their verdicts and that they may not have sufficient evidence to make informed decisions. The author of Passage A also argues that juries are not elected officials and therefore should not be making decisions about the law.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful way to indicate to the legislature that a law may be unjust or that a particular case is too trivial to pursue. The author of Passage B also suggests that jury nullification is unlikely to occur unless all twelve jurors are convinced that it is the appropriate course of action.
Thought: 
  The authors of the passages seem to have differing views about the role of juries in the legal system. The author of Passage A is critical of jury nullification, arguing that juries are not elected officials and may not have sufficient evidence to make informed decisions. The author of Passage B, on the other hand, sees jury nullification as a useful way to indicate to the legislature that a law may be unjust. 
  The passages do not directly address any of the other options.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism: 
  The passages do not explicitly address the issue of whether juries should interpret the law, so it is difficult to say for certain whether the authors would disagree about this. The author of Passage A does suggest that juries are not legislators and therefore should not be making decisions about the law, but this is not the same as saying that juries cannot or should not interpret the law. The author of Passage B, meanwhile, suggests that jury nullification can be a useful way to indicate to the legislature that a law may be unjust, which could be seen as a form of interpreting the law. 
  Therefore, while the authors of the passages may have different views on the issue of jury interpretation of the law, it is not clear enough to say for certain that they would disagree.
Action: Answer("D")

  Passage A discusses potential problems with jury nullification, such as the unknown frequency of use and the lack of accountability or obligation of the jury to think through the effects of their decision.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can serve as a useful safety valve when officials are overzealous and that it can also indicate to the legislature when a law may be unjust.
Thought:
  Passage A argues against jury nullification, asserting that juries do not have the authority to act as legislators and that they often lack the evidence or perspective to make a reasoned decision.
  Passage B argues in favor of jury nullification, asserting that it can serve as a check on overzealous officials and can provide valuable feedback to the legislature.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree over whether jury nullification is a problem or a useful tool.
  Answer choices A, B, C, and E are not directly related to the issue of jury nullification.
  Answer choice D, however, relates directly to the issue of jury nullification, as it concerns the extent of a jury's authority to interpret the law.
  The authors of the passages may disagree over whether juries have the authority to interpret the law or whether they are limited to applying it as instructed by the judge.
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism: N/A
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the problems created by the jury's power to nullify, including the lack of knowledge about how often it is used and whether it is being used for good or bad ends.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration
  D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
  E: Some of the refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today contain chemicals known to be environmentally damaging.
Response 0:

  Each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  In 1974, Molina and Rowland estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production, which meant that the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
  Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response.
  The Montreal Protocol of 1987 led to the ban of the production of ozone-depleting gases including CFCs.

  The passage talks about the discovery of CFCs and the depletion of the ozone layer.
  The passage doesn't say anything about refrigerant chemicals discovered after 1987.
  The passage doesn't say that CFCs were used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration.
  The passage mentions the cessation of CFC production in North America after the late 1970s, but this was due to the ban of CFCs, not the Montreal Protocol.
  The passage doesn't provide information about the content of refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
Criticism: 
  The passage doesn't specifically say that the cessation of CFC production in North America was due to the Montreal Protocol, but it is strongly implied, as the passage notes that the Montreal Protocol led to the ban of ozone-depleting gases including CFCs.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone
  B: testing to see whether the chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there
  C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine
  D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine
  E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage is about the depletion of the ozone layer due to the use of CFCs.
  CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs chemically react with ozone, releasing chlorine and destroying ozone molecules.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
Thought:
  To find out whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, we need to know if the chemical would have the same chemical reaction as CFCs with ozone.
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs react with ozone, releasing chlorine and destroying ozone molecules.
  Testing to see whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism:
  There is no direct indication in the passage that testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be the most useful method to determine if the chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Other methods such as testing the chemical to determine its effect on ozone and its constituent elements would also be relevant.
  However, since CFCs react with ozone by releasing chlorine, testing whether a chemical can react with chlorine could be a useful first step.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Molina and Rowland's research showed that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
- Chlorine atoms can destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
- The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
Thought:
- We need to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
- It is important to find a chemical that will not chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
- Therefore, we need to test whether the chemical would chemically react with ozone or chlorine.
- Option A is not helpful since we are concerned with the damage to the ozone layer.
- Option B is not helpful since we are not concerned with other chemicals commonly found in the lower atmosphere.
- Option D is not helpful since we are not concerned with the chemical properties shared by the chemical or its constituent elements with chlorine.
- Option E is not helpful since we are not concerned with whether the chemical will break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
- Therefore, the most useful experiment would be to test whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine, as this would help determine whether the chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to the use of CFCs.
  Two scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, discovered the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer and advocated for policy changes.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is caused by the chemical reaction of CFCs with ozone.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is caused by CFCs reacting with ozone and releasing chlorine, which then reacts with and destroys ozone.
  Therefore, testing whether the chemical would react with chlorine (option C) would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the harmful effects of manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone layer.
  CFCs are highly volatile chemicals that chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is caused by the breakdown of CFCs into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which reacts with ozone to both destroy ozone and regenerate chlorine atoms.
  Each chlorine atom can destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage describes the mechanism by which CFCs damage the ozone layer, suggesting that a replacement chemical must not break down into constituent elements that could react with ozone.
  Answer choice A is not relevant to determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs.
  Answer choice B is not specific enough to determine whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Answer choice C is relevant because a replacement chemical should not react with chlorine.
  Answer choice D may not be relevant to determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Answer choice E is relevant because a replacement chemical should not break down into its constituent elements when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
  Therefore, the most useful experiment would be to test whether the chemical would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
  The answer is E.
Criticism:
  The passage does not provide enough information to definitively state which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  However, given the information provided in the passage about the mechanism by which CFCs damage the ozone layer, testing a replacement chemical to determine whether it breaks down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation makes sense.
  Additionally, answer choice C is also relevant because a replacement chemical should not react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the scientific research of Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland on the effects of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone layer.
  CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
  Molina and Rowland advocated for a prompt and proportionate public policy response to the depletion of the ozone layer, which led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage explains that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, so it would be important to test whether a replacement chemical would react with other chemicals that could harm the ozone layer.
  Option A asks about testing whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone, but the passage does not suggest that this is relevant to determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Option B asks about testing whether the chemical would react with other chemicals commonly found in the lower atmosphere, but the passage does not suggest that this is a key factor in determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Option C asks about testing whether the chemical would react with chlorine, which is a key chemical involved in the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs. This could be useful information in determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Option D asks about testing the chemical or its constituent elements for properties they share with chlorine, but the passage does not suggest that this is a key factor in determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Option E asks about testing whether the chemical would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, which is how CFCs break down and contribute to ozone depletion. This could be useful information in determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Option C and Option E seem to be the most relevant experiments for determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, but Option C seems to be the more direct test of whether a chemical could react in a way that harms the ozone layer, while Option E is a test of whether a chemical could break down in a similar way to CFCs. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs cause damage to the ozone layer and became advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage explains that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, so the goal would be to find a chemical that does not have this effect.
  Therefore, it would be useful to test the chemical to see whether it would chemically react with chlorine, as chlorine is involved in the chemical reaction that destroys ozone.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the negative effects of CFCs on the ozone layer. 
  Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
Thought: 
  The question is asking which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Since CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, it is important to test whether a new chemical would not have the same effect on the ozone layer.
  Options (A), (B), (D), and (E) do not directly address the effects of a chemical on the ozone layer.
  Option (C) suggests testing whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine, which is one of the chemicals responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer.
  This would be the most useful experiment in determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: 
  Option (E) could also be a useful experiment to determine whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer since it would test whether the new chemical would break down into its constituent elements when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
  However, option (C) is more directly related to the chemical reaction that causes damage to the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) damage the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is a pressing environmental threat.
  Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response.
Thought: 
  The question is asking which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  A: Testing whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone would not be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  B: Testing whether the chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there may be useful in determining whether the chemical would react with CFCs, but it would not be the most useful experiment to determine if the chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  C: Testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be the most useful experiment in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer because the chemical reaction between CFCs and chlorine is what damages the ozone layer.
  D: Testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine may give some insight into whether the chemical would react with chlorine, but it would not be as useful as testing whether the chemical would react with chlorine.
  E: Testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation may be useful in understanding the chemical's behavior in the atmosphere, but it would not be the most useful experiment in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the dangers of manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to the ozone layer.
  CFCs chemically attack the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland conducted pioneering research and advocacy on the fragility of the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
Thought: 
  The question is asking which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Since CFCs react with and deplete ozone, it is important to consider if the replacement chemical would do the same.
  Choice A is not relevant because the chemical does not need to react with forms of oxygen other than ozone.
  Choice B is also not relevant because the lower atmosphere is not the layer where the ozone depletion occurs.
  Choice C is relevant because the chemical needs to be tested to see if it would react with chlorine.
  Choice D is not relevant because it does not address the chemical's effect on the ozone layer.
  Choice E is also relevant because it tests whether the chemical would break down when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, which is what causes CFCs to react with and deplete the ozone layer.
  Between choices C and E, choice C is more useful because it directly tests the chemical's reaction with chlorine, which is a key factor in ozone depletion.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: 
  The other options cannot be completely ruled out as they may still provide useful information about the impact of a replacement chemical on the ozone layer.
  Additionally, there may be other factors to consider beyond chlorine that could impact the ozone layer, so it is important to conduct a variety of experiments to fully assess the potential impact of a replacement chemical.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
  The depletion of the ozone layer occurs when CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  The passage discusses how Molina and Rowland became advocates for policy change to address the depletion of the ozone layer.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage provides information about how CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which then destroys the ozone layer.
  Therefore, testing whether a chemical would react with chlorine, like CFCs do, would be the most useful experiment to determine if it could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Option C asks to test the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
  Therefore, the answer to the question is C.
Criticism: 
  There is no information in the passage to support that testing whether a chemical would react with forms of oxygen other than ozone (Option A), reacting with other chemicals commonly found in the lower atmosphere (Option B), or testing the chemical for chemical properties that it shares with chlorine (Option D) would be useful experiments in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Option E asks to test whether the chemical would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
  While this information is relevant to the discussion of CFCs breaking down into their constituent elements when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, it does not address whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, the power of negative evidence.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of the planet Uranus and the attempted prediction of its orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers found that their predictions were incorrect and hypothesized the existence of another planet, which turned out to be Neptune. The passage also discusses the attempted prediction of the orbit of Mercury based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, the hypothesized existence of another planet (Vulcan), and the eventual discovery that Einstein's theory of relativity predicted the observed orbit of Mercury.
Thought: 
  Passage A describes a disturbing force as one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists use to derive a theory's predictions.
  In Passage B, the hypothetical existence of Vulcan could be considered a disturbing force if it is incorrect.
  However, the passage also mentions the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets as auxiliary assumptions, and it is possible that one or more of these could be a disturbing force.
  None of the answer choices specifically mentions a disturbing force, but one could argue that the moon's gravitational pull on Mercury could be considered a disturbing force.
  However, this is not explicitly discussed in the passage.
  Therefore, there is no clear answer to this question.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science regarding the power of negative evidence. Popper states that negative evidence is at the heart of scientific research, and theories count as scientific only if they make testable predictions. Passage B provides examples of how scientists used observations and predictions to make conclusions about the presence of planets and the accuracy of Newton's laws. 
Thought: 
  Passage A states that auxiliary premises, which appeal to other theories, the correct functioning of instrumentation, and the absence of disturbing forces, are needed to predict a theory's outcome. Passage B discusses how astronomers made predictions about the orbits of planets using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. When the orbits were not observed as expected, astronomers had to search for alternative explanations. One possible explanation for their incorrect predictions was the presence of a disturbing force, as described in Passage A. Therefore, the best answer choice is the planet that had the most impact on the observed orbit of another planet.
  Uranus, the sun, Neptune, and Mercury were all discussed in passage B as planets whose orbits were predicted using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. The moon was not mentioned in the passage, so it is not relevant to the question. 
  Uranus was the first planet mentioned in passage B, and astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. The incorrect predictions for Uranus led to the discovery of Neptune. However, neither Uranus nor Neptune had a significant impact on the observed orbit of another planet. 
  The sun was one of the auxiliary assumptions made by astronomers when predicting the orbit of Uranus. However, the sun did not have a significant impact on the observed orbit of any other planet. 
  Neptune was discovered after the astronomers' predictions for Uranus were incorrect. The presence of Neptune led to a correction of their predictions. However, Neptune did not have a significant impact on the observed orbit of any other planet. 
  Mercury was discussed last in passage B, and scientists predicted its orbit using Newton's laws. The incorrect predictions for Mercury led to the hypothesis of another planet, Vulcan. The lack of evidence for Vulcan led some scientists to question Newton's laws. However, the presence of a disturbing force, as described in Passage A, was not explicitly mentioned in relation to Mercury.
  While none of the answer choices is an exact match, Mercury is the closest to an answer choice that describes a disturbing force, as the incorrect predictions for Mercury led to the hypothesis of another planet and a questioning of Newton's laws. 
Criticism:
  The question asks for the best example of a disturbing force, which is not clearly defined in either passage. While Passage A does mention the absence of disturbing forces as one of the auxiliary premises needed to make predictions, it does not explicitly define or describe disturbing forces. Therefore, it is difficult to determine which answer choice is the best example of a disturbing force. Additionally, Passage B does not provide a clear example of a disturbing force, which makes it challenging to answer the question.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Popper's philosophy of science and the use of negative evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B describes the discovery of planets and the use of auxiliary assumptions to predict their orbits.
  The passage discusses how the failure of predictions can be due to errors in auxiliary assumptions, including the presence of disturbing forces.
Thought:
  Passage A describes how auxiliary assumptions can impact predictions in science.
  Passage B discusses how auxiliary assumptions are used to predict the orbits of planets.
  The astronomers made predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  They found that their predictions for Uranus' orbit were incorrect.
  One possible explanation for the failure was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions, including the presence of disturbing forces.
  Therefore, one of the planets close to Uranus, Neptune, could have been a disturbing force.
  The answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism:
  There is no explicit mention of "disturbing force" in Passage B, only auxiliary assumptions.
  While Neptune's presence was an auxiliary assumption that was changed, it is not clear that it was a disturbing force.
  It is possible that the mass of the sun or other planets were the disturbing force, or that there was an error in the calculations.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's philosophy of science, and the power of negative evidence. The passage explains that when a theory deductively entails a false prediction, the theory must be false.
  Passage B provides two examples where scientists used a theory to make predictions about the orbits of Uranus and Mercury, but the predictions were not borne out. Scientists then hypothesized the existence of other planets or changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets in order to align their calculations with their observations.
Thought: 
  Passage A explains that when experiments do not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. One of these explanations could be the presence of a disturbing force. A disturbing force is not explained in detail but appears to be an external factor that influences the outcome of an experiment. In Passage B, the orbits of Uranus and Mercury did not match the predictions based on the theories used by scientists at the time. Scientists hypothesized the existence of other planets or changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets to align their calculations with their observations. Therefore, it is possible that the presence of a disturbing force could have influenced the observations of Uranus and Mercury.
  Uranus, the sun, Neptune, and Mercury are all mentioned in Passage B as being relevant to the astronomers' predictions and observations. However, the moon is not mentioned at all.
  The only answer choice that could be related to a disturbing force is not a planet, but rather an external factor that could influence the orbit of a planet.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science, which includes the importance of negative evidence in disproving hypotheses.
  Passage B discusses the attempts by astronomers to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  Passage A describes how "disturbing forces" can affect the accuracy of a theory's predictions.
Thought: 
  According to passage A, a "disturbing force" is a premise or factor that can affect the accuracy of a theory's predictions.
  Passage B discusses the attempts by astronomers to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers' predictions about Uranus were incorrect, and they changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets to account for the observed orbit.
  The astronomers' predictions about Mercury were also incorrect, and they hypothesized the existence of another planet, Vulcan, to account for the observed orbit.
  The discovery of Einstein's theory of relativity later explained the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity.
  None of the choices directly mention a disturbing force.
  Therefore, we need to identify which choice represents a premise or factor that could have affected the accuracy of the astronomers' predictions for Uranus or Mercury.
  Choice E, the moon, is not relevant to the astronomers' predictions of Uranus or Mercury.
  Choices A, B, and C, Uranus, the sun, and Neptune, are all mentioned in passage B as factors that were used as auxiliary assumptions in the prediction of Uranus's orbit, and the discovery of Neptune later helped explain the discrepancy between their predictions and observations.
  Choice D, Mercury, is the planet whose predicted orbit did not match observations and required the hypothesis of another planet to explain.
  None of the choices clearly represents a "disturbing force" as described in passage A, but auxiliary assumptions can be seen as affecting the accuracy of a theory's predictions.
  Therefore, the best choice is either A, B, or C, as they are auxiliary assumptions used in the prediction of Uranus's orbit.
  Between these three, Uranus and Neptune are planets, while the sun is a star that exerts gravitational force on all planets, making it a more likely candidate for a disturbing force.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is B, the sun.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science and his view on the power of negative evidence.
  Passage B recounts the discovery of planets and how astronomers made predictions about their orbits based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  Passage A mentions that auxiliary premises are often used in scientific research and can impact predictions.
Thought: 
  Passage A mentions that auxiliary premises are often used in scientific research and can impact predictions.
  Passage B discusses how astronomers made predictions about the orbits of planets using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  One of these auxiliary assumptions was the absence of other planets that could affect Uranus's orbit.
  The failure of the predictions led to the hypothesis that there was another planet close to Uranus affecting its orbit.
  This suggests that the presence of other planets can be a disturbing force that affects the accuracy of predictions.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Popper's views on the power of negative evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and the subsequent discovery of Neptune using Newton's laws as well as the prediction of the orbit of Mercury using both Newton's laws and Einstein's theory of relativity.
  Disturbing forces are mentioned in Passage A as one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists rely on to derive predictions from a theory.
Thought:
  The question asks for an example of a disturbing force in Passage B, which is related to the auxiliary premises that scientists rely on to derive predictions from a theory.
  In Passage B, the auxiliary assumptions about the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets were used to predict the orbit of Uranus.
  One of these auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus, which turned out to be false.
  The discovery of Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring calculations into alignment with observations suggests that the gravity of Neptune was a disturbing force that affected the predicted orbit of Uranus.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism:
  There is no clear mention of disturbing forces in Passage B, and the term itself is not used.
  The discovery of Neptune may have affected the predicted orbit of Uranus, but it is not explicitly described as a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contributions to philosophy of science, and how a single negative evidence can disprove a hypothesis, while positive evidence has no value as evidence.
  Passage B discusses how astronomers discovered the planet Neptune based on observations of Uranus' orbit, and how the discovery of Einstein's general theory of relativity led to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity.
Thought: 
  Passage A describes how auxiliary premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, or to the absence of disturbing forces, are usually needed to derive a theory's predictions. 
  Passage B describes how astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. However, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions, such as the assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. 
  Therefore, the answer is E: the moon, as it is an example of a disturbing force that could affect the orbit of Mercury (line 36). 
Criticism: 
  There is no mention of the moon affecting the orbit of Mercury in the passage. The passage only refers to the need for additional assumptions to derive a theory's predictions (lines 20-24), and to the hypothetical planet Vulcan that was postulated to explain the deviations in Mercury's orbit (lines 32-35).
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, particularly the power of negative evidence. It also highlights the logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence and how Popper believes that scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them.
  Passage B talks about the discovery of Uranus and attempts to predict its orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. It also discusses the failure of predictions regarding the orbit of Mercury and the hypothesis of the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which was later confirmed by Einstein's general theory of relativity.

Thoughts:
  Passage A mentions that auxiliary premises can be required for the correct functioning of instrumentation and to the absence of disturbing forces.
  Passage B discusses the incorrect predictions regarding the orbit of Uranus and Mercury.
  In the case of Uranus, one of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. The discovery of Neptune later confirmed the presence of a planet in that vicinity, which was not considered in the original predictions.
  In the case of Mercury, there were attempts to predict its orbit based on Newton's laws, but the predictions were not accurate. Scientists hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which was never found. Finally, Einstein's theory was used to predict the observed orbit of Mercury.
  Based on the information provided, it is not clear which one of the options represents a disturbing force.

Criticism:
  There's no information in the passage that clearly identifies any of the options as a disturbing force. The passage talks about auxiliary assumptions, but not about any specific disturbing force.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Popper's contributions to science, including the power of negative evidence and the search for evidence that would disprove theories.
  Passage B discusses how astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to make predictions about the orbits of planets.
  The astronomers' predictions were not always accurate, and they had to revise their assumptions to account for discrepancies.
Thought: 
  In passage A, the author describes "disturbing forces" as auxiliary premises that scientists use to derive a theory's predictions. These premises can include other theories, instrumentation, and other factors that could impact the accuracy of the predictions.
  In passage B, the astronomers were using auxiliary assumptions about the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury.
  One of these assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus, which turned out to be false.
  The astronomers had to revise this assumption and conclude that there was another planet nearby that was impacting Uranus's orbit.
  This situation could be considered an example of a disturbing force, as the existence of this other planet was an external factor that was affecting the accuracy of their predictions.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism: 
  There are other possible examples of disturbing forces in passage B, such as the mass of the sun or the orbits of other planets.
  However, the discovery of Neptune is a more direct and clear-cut example of a disturbing force, as it was a previously unknown factor that the astronomers had not accounted for in their initial predictions.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred that the aulbor would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?
Choices:
  A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model ofpub1ishing will be uuiikely to remain economically competitive.
  B: The primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers aud haudheld devices for reading text.
  C: The growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business.
  D: Any book will sell more copies ifit is published digitally thau if it is published traditionally.
  E: Digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses the potential for digital publishing to replace or rival traditional publishing and the economic advantages of digital publishing over traditional publishing.
A: The passage suggests that publishers who do not embrace the new digital model of publishing may lose their authors, but it does not explicitly state that they will be economically uncompetitive.
B: The passage does not suggest that the use of computers and handheld devices for reading text would be a threat to the spread of digital publishing. 
C: The passage does not discuss how digital publishing would impact the book retail business.
D: The passage does not make any claims about book sales in relation to whether they are published digitally or traditionally.
E: The passage does not discuss the impact of digital publishing on advertising budgets.
Thought: 
The author discusses the economic efficiency and convenience of digital publishing, and suggests that it will eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing. The author also suggests that established publishers will initially be reluctant to embrace the new model, and that digital publishing firms will have an advantage in bidding for new manuscripts. 
Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would agree with choice A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
Criticism: 
None.

  Once most books have been digitized, anyone with access to the internet can purchase printed books from a limitless digital catalog.
  The digital publication of a book online eliminates the costs of warehousing, shipping, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers.
Thought:
  The author believes that the digital model of publishing is more economically efficient and convenient for customers.
  Under the digital publishing model, the costs of printing, selling, and distributing physical books are eliminated.
  The author suggests that traditional publishers may be reluctant to embrace the new digital model initially.
  The author suggests that upstart digital-publishing firms are unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure.
  Traditional publishers may have to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors.
  The author suggests that traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions to remain competitive.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would agree with statement A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the future of publishing will involve digital publishing, but that most digital files of books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale. 
  The elimination of physical inventory will make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. 
  Under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds.
Thought: 
  The author argues that digital publishing will eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing. 
  The elimination of certain expenses means that authors would be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. 
  Established publishers will initially be reluctant to change their traditional practices and infrastructure, which presents an opportunity for upstart digital-publishing firms.

  The author does not argue that the primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers and handheld devices for reading text, so statement B is incorrect.
  The author does not argue that digital publishing will revitalize the book retail business, so statement C is incorrect.
  The author does not argue that any book will sell more copies if it is published digitally than if it is published traditionally, so statement D is incorrect.
  The author does not argue that digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books, so statement E is incorrect.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the digital model of publishing is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing due to its economic efficiency and convenience for customers. Once most books have been digitized, anyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practically limitless digital catalog. The costs of printing, selling, and distributing physical books will be eliminated, which will make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. The author argues that under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Literacy agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. However, large established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede.
Thought: 
  The author argues that the digital model of publishing is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing due to its economic efficiency and convenience for customers. Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would agree with the statement that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive. 
  Choice B is not supported by the passage. The author states that it is likely that most digital files of books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in factories. This suggests that the widespread use of computers and handheld devices for reading text is not a primary threat to the spread of digital publishing.
  Choice C is not supported by the passage. The author does not mention anything about the growth of digital publishing revitalizing the book retail business.
  Choice D is not supported by the passage. The author does not make any claim that any book will sell more copies if it is published digitally than if it is published traditionally.
  Choice E is not supported by the passage. The author does not mention anything about digital publishing allowing publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.
Criticism: 
  None

This implies that publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model might find it difficult to remain economically competitive.
  The author does not mention anything about the widespread use of computers and handheld devices for reading text or the growth of digital publishing revitalizing book retail business.
  The author does not state that any book will sell more copies if published digitally than traditional publishing.
  The author also does not mention anything about digital publishing allowing publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a unique position towards Russian literary criticism during his time.
  There were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the other maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality.
  Dostoyevsky took the position of a realist.
  He believed that reality was the crucial source of literature, but reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Dostoyevsky took the position of a realist.
  He believed that reality was the crucial source of literature, but reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Therefore, he most likely disagreed with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  The answer is D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly say that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the view because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  The passage does say that Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  However, this does not necessarily mean that he disagreed with the view because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  There could be other reasons why he disagreed with that view.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
- Reality was far more than the merely tangible.
- Dostoyevsky believed that the fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.
- Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit.
- Dostoyevsky believed that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms.
Thought:
- Dostoyevsky believed that reality was crucial to literature.
- The view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday may mean that art does not need to be tied to the tangible reality that Dostoyevsky believed was needed.
- Therefore, Dostoyevsky would most likely disagree with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
- Dostoyevsky's belief that the fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it suggests that he believed that reality and fantasy should be intertwined, which is incompatible with the belief that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
- Dostoyevsky's belief that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit suggests that he would disagree with any view that art should have a societal end.
Criticism:
- The passage does not state that Dostoyevsky believed that the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position on the debate between two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  One position believed art stood above the present and the everyday, while the other believed that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality was deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics. 
  Reality was shaped by the person who experienced it.
  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit." 
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky appeared to be critical of the belief that art should stand high above the present and everyday because he believed reality was shaped by the person who experienced it, and the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. 
  Therefore, he may have believed that art should be grounded in reality and the everyday to better capture the human experience.
  Thus, Dostoyevsky would most likely disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday as expressed in option A, but agree with option B, which recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
Criticism: 
  Your inference on Dostoyevsky's opinion about the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday is correct. 
  Option B is most accurate with respect to Dostoyevsky's position. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Dostoevsky took a third position regarding the two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during his time.
- The radical view was that literature should find its sources in concrete reality and contribute to the creation of a new society, making literature useful.
- Dostoevsky's understanding of reality was different from the radical view. Reality was deeper than just tangible things, and there was no distinction between fantasy and reality for him.
- Dostoevsky believed that literature should be artistic and that art should not necessarily be useful. Artistry, for him, was the ability to write well.
Thought:
- The passage states that Dostoevsky's understanding of reality was different from the radical view.
- The radical view maintained that art stood high above the present and everyday.
- Therefore, Dostoevsky would most likely disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
- He believed that reality was deeper than just tangible things and that art should be able to depict this deeper reality.
- Therefore, the best answer is B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
Criticism:
- There is no mention in the passage of the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday recognizing that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
- While Dostoevsky did believe that reality was deeper than just tangible things, there is no indication that he agreed with the specific view mentioned in choice B.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a unique position on Russian literary criticism.
  He believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  He did not agree with the radical critics that art should be useful to society.
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Dostoyevsky took a unique position on Russian literary criticism.
  He believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  He believed that the radical critics' demand that art should stand high above the present and everyday was incorrect because they assumed that reality must be depicted "as it is."
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would most likely disagree with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  The answer is not A because the passage does not support the idea that Dostoyevsky believed that art should have a strong element of the fantastic.
  The answer is not B because the passage does not support the idea that Dostoyevsky agreed with the idea that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  The answer is not C because the passage does not support the idea that Dostoyevsky believed that reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  The answer is not D because the passage does not support the idea that Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  The answer is E because the passage mentions that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' insistence that art should further some societal end.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position in Russian literary criticism.
  One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality.
  Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
Thought: 
  The question asks which statement Dostoyevsky would most likely agree with regarding the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source, so he would likely disagree with the idea that art should stand high above reality.
  Additionally, he believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, so he would likely not agree with the idea that art should stand above the everyday.
  Therefore, the likely answer is that Dostoyevsky would consider the view incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  Choice C matches this statement.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  He believed that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  He believed that there was no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  He believed that a work of art must stand or fall on its artistic merit alone.
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky's view was that art must be based on reality, but he believed that reality was far more than the mundane details of life.
  He believed that reality included the fantastic and that there was no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would not agree with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  The answer is not A or B.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a work of art must stand or fall on its artistic merit alone and that art should not serve a particular political view or be useful to society.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would not agree with the view that art should be high above the present and everyday because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy and because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
  The answer is either C or E.
Criticism: 
  While it is true that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the foundation of all literature, he also believed that reality included the fantastic and that there was no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Dostoyevsky would disagree with the view that art should be high above the present and everyday because it is based on reality.
  The answer is not C.
  While it is true that Dostoyevsky believed that art should not serve a particular political view or be useful to society, he did not believe that art should never have any impact on society.
  In fact, he believed that a work of art could be useful without being intentionally so, but rather as a result of its artistic merit.
  Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Dostoyevsky would disagree with the view that art should be high above the present and everyday because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
  The answer is not E.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position on the debate on Russian literary criticism.
  He believed that reality was literature's crucial source but his understanding of reality was deeper than the radical critics.
  What may not be reality for one person may be reality for another person.
  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
Thought:  
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  It can, therefore, be inferred that he would not agree with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday as it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  Therefore, the answer is D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Criticism: 
  The answer is correct. Dostoyevsky's belief that writers should explode the boundaries of the so-called real world and that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it imply that he would not agree with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday as it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoevsky took a third position in Russian literary criticism, different from the two opposing positions.
  For Dostoevsky, reality was literature's crucial source, but he believed in a deeper understanding of reality.
  Dostoevsky believed that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
Thought: 
  Dostoevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but he believed in a deeper understanding of reality that includes both fantasy and reality itself.
  The radical critics' view that art should stand high above the present and everyday is not incorrect because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  Therefore, Dostoevsky would most likely agree with choice B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state that Dostoevsky agreed with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  However, it can be inferred that Dostoevsky believed that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  This implies that Dostoevsky believed that reality is more complex and deeper than just mundane details of life, but it does not necessarily mean that he agreed with the specific view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's views on literature and its relationship to reality and artistry, as well as his criticisms of the opposing views of some Russian literary critics.
Thought: 
  The passage states that Dostoyevsky took a different position from the two opposing views on Russian literary criticism prevalent during his time. 
  One view held that art should stand high above the present and everyday, while the other view maintained that art should have a strong foundation in concrete reality and contribute to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky, as a realist, believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but he did not agree with the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is." 
  He believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it and that there was no distinction between fantasy and reality. 
  According to Dostoyevsky, the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The passage does not state that Dostoyevsky agreed with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: The author most likely lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings (lines 38–43) primarily to
Choices:
  A: show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses discretionary nonenforcement by law enforcement agencies.
  Capricious enforcement is not the central tendency but not unknown.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement (line 32) implies enforcement that is unpredictable, arbitrary, or unreasonable.
  "Not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law" (choice E) seems to fit the definition of capricious enforcement.
  The passage argues that discretionary nonenforcement is used to reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is unlikely since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation.
  The answer is not E.
  The passage also argues that the technique of discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases.
  Therefore, the answer is neither A nor C.
  Choice B appears to be the opposite of capricious enforcement, as it suggests that the law is enforced according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws.
  Therefore, the answer is B.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses discretionary nonenforcement as a technique used by law enforcement agencies to reduce the costs of overinclusion in laws.
  Capricious enforcement refers to enforcement that is unpredictable or based on whim rather than established principles.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement (line 32) is defined as enforcement that is not based on established principles or is unpredictable.
  This means that the enforcement is not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  Therefore, the answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. Capricious enforcement is not based on established principles, which means that the law enforcement agency is not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law. 
  However, it is important to note that capricious enforcement is not the same as selective enforcement, which is when law enforcement agencies choose to enforce certain laws over others due to resource constraints or other factors. 
  Therefore, it is important to distinguish between the two concepts when discussing law enforcement techniques.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the power of law enforcement agencies to nullify laws by declining to prosecute violators. 
  The passage explains that rules of law are often overinclusive and enforcing them literally can create heavy social costs.
  The passage suggests that discretionary nonenforcement can reduce the costs of overinclusion without creating underinclusion.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement refers to enforcement of the law that is unpredictable and based on whim rather than principle.
  The passage argues that capricious enforcement is not the central tendency of law enforcement agencies.
  It suggests that legislative oversight ensures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct. The passage suggests that capricious enforcement involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  None of the other choices are directly related to capricious enforcement.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the power of law enforcement agencies to use discretionary nonenforcement when the costs of overinclusion of a law are too high and enforcing it to the letter could impose significant social costs. 
  Capricious enforcement is not rare, but legislative oversight helps to prevent it.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement means unpredictable or arbitrary enforcement of the law.
  Since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced, capricious enforcement would likely involve not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  Therefore, the answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  Your interpretation of capricious enforcement is correct as unpredictability in law enforcement could lead to non-following of the intent of the legislature. 
  However, it is also possible that capricious enforcement could involve enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible. 
  So, it is possible that choice A is also correct, but in the context of Passage A, choice E is more relevant. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the technique of discretionary nonenforcement, which allows law enforcement agencies to effectively nullify particular laws or applications of laws.
  Capricious enforcement is mentioned as a possibility but is not the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement refers to enforcement that involves unpredictable or arbitrary decisions, rather than following a consistent principle.
  Based on the passage, it is unlikely that capricious enforcement is the central tendency of law enforcement agencies since there is legislative oversight to prevent the agencies from straying too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. 
  Capricious enforcement would involve unpredictable or arbitrary decisions, rather than following a consistent principle.

Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement is mentioned in the passage as a deviation from the intended regulation being enforced.
  The passage mentions that legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation.
  Enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible or prioritizing enforcement according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes are not mentioned in the passage.
  Not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law or not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law are not mentioned as examples of capricious enforcement in the passage.
  Thus, capricious enforcement most likely involves not following the intended regulation being enforced.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct in identifying that capricious enforcement involves not following the intended regulation being enforced.
  However, the passage specifically mentions that capricious enforcement is not common due to legislative oversight. 
  The passage did not directly mention that capricious enforcement is a deviation from the intended regulation being enforced, but this is implied by the passage's discussion of the risks of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  A: This option describes an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies. This is not related to the crime deterrence debate.

  E: This option describes a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session. This is not related to the crime deterrence debate.
Thought: 
  The question asks for the scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  The passage describes how the utility maximization principle can be used as an economic framework to analyze a person's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  None of the options describe a scenario that is similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a debate in the legal community on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  Some legal scholars suggest that changing societal norms and institutions can reduce crime, while others suggest increasing fines and penalties is the best deterrence method.
  Recent legal scholarship has introduced the economic principle of utility maximization to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  Within this economic framework, both deterrence methods have the same overall effect on reducing crime.
Thought: 
  The question asks which scenario is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  Based on the passage, some legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to show that deterrence methods based on changing societal norms and institutions and those based on increasing fines and penalties are not fundamentally in conflict and that the optimal approach would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  Therefore, the answer would be a scenario where a principle or concept from one field is used to support or explain something in another field.
  A is about an astronomer using a paradox to explain a phenomenon in a new way; this is not similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle.
  B is about a drawing instructor using a law of optics to demonstrate that two lines appear to diverge but are actually parallel; this is also not similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle.
  C is about a botanist using a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest; this is not similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle.
  D is about a judge using evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a legal case; this is somewhat similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle, as both involve using concepts from one field to support or explain something in another field.
  E is about a mediator using a short quotation from a novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct; this is not similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. 
Criticism: 
  One could argue that option D is not the best answer, as the passage does not explicitly say that legal scholars are using evidence from another field, like anthropology, to support their use of the utility maximization principle. However, the passage does suggest that legal scholars are using an economic principle to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime, and that this analysis shows that both deterrence methods have the same overall effect on reducing crime. This is somewhat similar to a judge using evidence from another field to support a legal decision, as both involve drawing on external knowledge to support or explain something in the legal field. 
Action: Answer("D")

  D: This choice describes a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a legal case. It is related to the legal field, but it is not related to the crime deterrence debate or the utility maximization principle.
  E: This choice describes a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session. It is not related to the crime deterrence debate or the utility maximization principle.
Thought: 
  The question asks which scenario is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  The passage describes how the utility maximization principle is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  The passage also explains that the two positions in the crime deterrence debate are complementary when viewed through the lens of the utility maximization principle.
  Therefore, the scenario that is most similar to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle would involve using an economic principle to analyze an individual's decision-making process and reconcile seemingly opposing viewpoints.
  This scenario is not described in any of the answer choices.
Criticism: 
  The question asks which scenario is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  However, none of the answer choices are related to the crime deterrence debate or the utility maximization principle in the way that the question asks.
  Therefore, the question is flawed and cannot be answered.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Legal scholars are debating the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  Two main positions are that changing societal norms or increasing penalties and law enforcement are the best way to deter deliberate crimes.
  Recent scholarship suggests that the utility maximization principle can reconcile the two positions.
  The utility maximization principle states that an individual will choose an action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The principle can be used to analyze an individual’s decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that some legal scholars are using the utility maximization principle to reconcile the two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  The principle is used to analyze an individual’s decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, the scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars’ use of the utility maximization principle is one in which a principle from one area is used to explain a phenomenon or solve a problem in another area.
  None of the other scenarios in the answer choices involve using a principle from one area to solve a problem in another area.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Criticism: 
  Using a principle from one area to solve a problem in another area is a common approach in interdisciplinary research and scholarship.
  While the scenarios in the other answer choices do not involve using a principle from one area to solve a problem in another area, they could still be valid analogies or examples in other contexts.
  Therefore, the answer "None of the Above" may not be the most appropriate or accurate answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle in the debate about the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  A: This choice describes an astronomer using a paradox to describe a phenomenon observed with new technology; this is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  B: This choice describes a drawing instructor using a law of optics from physics to demonstrate a counterintuitive phenomenon; this is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  C: This choice describes a botanist using a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about plant competition in a forest; this is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  D: This choice describes a judge using evidence from anthropology in a legal case; this is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  E: This choice describes a mediator using a quotation from a novel to set a tone of collegiality at the start of a bargaining session; this is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
Thought:
  The question asks which scenario is similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  The passage explains that legal scholars have used the economic principle of utility maximization to analyze the decision to commit a deliberate crime as a rational economic choice.
  This analysis shows that increasing the cost of committing a crime (through penalties or detection) reduces the expected utility of criminal activity, making it less likely that people will choose to commit a crime.
  Similarly, increasing the expected utility of lawful activity (such as economic opportunities) also reduces the likelihood of criminal activity.
  Based on this information, the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate is similar to a scenario in which someone uses a theory or principle from one field to provide insight or understanding in another field.
  The passage also suggests that the two sides of the debate are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.

  This passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle to reconcile two opposing views on how to deter crime: one which focuses on societal factors and one which focuses on penalties and law enforcement. 
  A: This answer choice describes an astronomer using a paradox to explain a new observation in the field, which is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  B: This answer choice describes a drawing instructor using a law of optics to demonstrate that two lines appear to diverge but are actually parallel, which is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  C: This answer choice describes a botanist using a quotation from an Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest, which is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  D: This answer choice describes a judge using evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case, which is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  E: This answer choice describes a mediator using a quotation from a novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session, which is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate. 
Thought: 
  The utility maximization principle is used to reconcile two opposing views on how to deter crime.
  The passage does not provide any examples that are similar to this scenario.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the crime deterrence debate and the utility maximization principle.
  The utility maximization principle is an economic principle that holds that individuals make rational choices to maximize their overall satisfaction or expected utility.
Thought: 
  Some legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to analyze the rational economic choice of committing a crime. 
  This principle helps them determine that increasing penalties and strengthening law enforcement makes a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime.
  Similarly, increasing economic opportunities for those most alienated from economic institutions increases the expected utility from lawful activity, which also makes a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime.
  Thus, this use of the utility maximization principle helps reconcile the two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  The scenario that is most similar to this use of the utility maximization principle is one in which a person borrows from another field or discipline to help make a point or explain a phenomenon.
  Choices (A), (B), (C), and (D) do not fit this scenario.
  The closest scenario is (E), in which a mediator borrows a quotation from a well-known novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session.
Criticism: 
  The scenario described in (E) does not involve borrowing from another field to make a point or explain a phenomenon, but rather using a quotation to set a tone.
  Another scenario that might be more similar to the use of the utility maximization principle is one in which an economist borrows from physics to explain a concept in economics, such as when an economist uses the concept of friction to explain market inefficiencies.
  However, this scenario is not one of the available choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of the economic principle of utility maximization to reconcile two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  A: The scenario describes an astronomer using a paradox from ancient cosmology as a metaphor to aid in explaining a recent observation.
  B: The scenario describes a drawing instructor using a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge are actually parallel.
  C: The scenario describes a botanist using a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest.
  D: The scenario describes a judge using evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
  E: The scenario describes a mediator using a short quotation from a well-known novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session.
Thought: 
  The passage explains how legal scholars are using an economic principle to reconcile two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  None of the scenarios involve using a principle from another field to reconcile two conflicting positions.
  Therefore, none of the scenarios are similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle.
  There is no closely related answer choice, so I will choose the most plausible answer, which is D.
Criticism: 
  The passage is clearly focused on the use of an economic principle to reconcile two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  None of the scenarios involve using a principle from another field to reconcile conflicting positions.
  However, the passage does not provide any information or analogy to support or refute any of the answer choices.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of the economic principle of utility maximization in the crime deterrence debate.
  The principle of utility maximization holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  Rational individuals analyze the expected utility of each action by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
Thought: 
  Legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to analyze the expected utility of committing a crime.
  Rational individuals will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  Both sides of the crime deterrence debate affect the utility equation, and the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict.
  Therefore, the use of the utility maximization principle is similar to a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
Criticism: 
  There is no clear connection between the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate and a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a legal decision.
  While the use of evidence from anthropology could potentially support a legal decision, it is not directly related to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a debate in the legal community regarding the best way to deter deliberate crimes.
  One side of the debate emphasizes societal factors, such as changing people's beliefs about crime and increasing economic opportunities for the most alienated individuals.
  The other side of the debate emphasizes individual choice and advocates for increasing penalties and strengthening law enforcement.
  The utility maximization principle holds that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  Rational individuals choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
Thought:
  The passage describes how the utility maximization principle can be used to reconcile the two sides of the crime deterrence debate.
  Legal scholars use this principle to analyze the rationality of an individual's decision to commit a crime.
  The principle holds that individuals weigh the utilities of possible outcomes and choose the action with the highest expected utility, and that deterrence policies affect the utility equation.
  Therefore, the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate is most similar to a physicist using a law of optics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists were conducting experiments on neutron bombardment of uranium to determine if atoms could be split.
  From 1934 to 1939, increasing evidence was compiled that nuclear fission had been achieved, but without recognition of what was happening.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939, which led to the recognition that uranium atoms were being split.
Thought: 
  Physicists did not realize what they were witnessing when they were compiling increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  The recognition of uranium atoms being split was made only when Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  Therefore, something that could have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize atoms were being split could be a change in the experimental approach or a change in the theoretical considerations.
  Option B suggests that the physicists conducting the experiments did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, and this lack of expectation might have encouraged them to think more broadly about the possibilities and recognize the significance of the evidence they had collected.
  Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  Option A has no clear relation to the question and is not likely to have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize atoms were being split.
  Option C suggests that the physicists were not aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms, but it is unclear how this could have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize atoms were being split since there was already experimental evidence of nuclear fission.
  Option D suggests that more physicists concentrated on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium, but it is unclear how this would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize atoms were being split since the experimental results were already being obtained.
  Option E suggests that physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium, but it is unclear how this would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize atoms were being split since the crucial theoretical connection was made when studying uranium.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Physicists conducted experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Between 1934 and 1939, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
Thought: 
  Physicists took some time to realize that atoms were being split.
  To reduce the amount of time it took, one of the following must be true:
    A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques. - This is irrelevant and not likely to reduce the amount of time it took.
    B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products. - If the physicists had not been expecting particular nuclear compositions, they may have been more open to alternative explanations and more likely to recognize what they were witnessing.
    C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms. - Theoretical calculations were already made even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
    D: More physicists concentrated on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium. - This is unlikely to reduce the amount of time it took as many physicists were already conducting experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
    E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium. - Conducting experiments on other substances may not have been as fruitful as the experiments on uranium, which produced the crucial evidence for nuclear fission.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Criticism: 
  All of the choices except B are either irrelevant or unlikely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  However, it is not clear from the passage whether the physicists had particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products or not.
  Therefore, the answer is not clear.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and how it took physicists several years to realize what they were witnessing.
  The discovery came after several experiments involving neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939, recognizing that uranium atoms were being split.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that physicists did not recognize what they were witnessing when they conducted experiments involving neutron bombardment of uranium.
  If physicists had not had particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products (B), it would have been easier for them to recognize what was happening.
  Therefore, B would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how physicists discovered nuclear fission between 1934 and 1939.
  Initially, they conducted neutron bombardment experiments on uranium without realizing they were splitting the atoms.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939, recognizing that they were actually splitting uranium atoms.
Thought:
  The discovery of nuclear fission took several years because the physicists conducting the neutron bombardment experiments did not realize they were splitting the atoms.
  To reduce the amount of time it took to realize what was happening, one of the following would have had to be true:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques. - This would not have helped them realize what was happening with the uranium atoms.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products. - This could have helped them be more open-minded about the by-products and what they could indicate.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms. - This would not have helped them realize what was happening with the uranium atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium. - This could have led to more data, but it would not necessarily have helped them realize what was happening with the uranium atoms.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium. - This could have led to a quicker realization of the phenomenon if the other substance behaved differently under neutron bombardment.
  The most likely answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Criticism:
  It is possible that having more physicists concentrate on obtaining experimental results could have led to a quicker realization of the phenomenon, but it is not a guarantee.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists discovered nuclear fission through neutron-bombardment experiments with uranium from 1934 to 1939.
  Scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Earlier, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart, but researchers were not receptive to the possibility.
Thought: 
  Physicists did not recognize they were splitting uranium atoms because they were not receptive to the possibility of breaking atoms apart, and they had expectations of the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, even though some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it was possible to split atoms.
  To reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split, they would have needed to be more receptive to the possibility of breaking atoms apart and not have expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  Choice B states that physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, which would have made it easier to recognize that they were splitting atoms, and would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the factors that delayed its recognition. 
  Physicists had increasing evidence of nuclear fission through neutron bombardment of uranium between 1934 and 1939, but did not recognize what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the recognition of nuclear fission was delayed mainly because researchers were not receptive to the possibility that it could happen in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments, and also because they had expectations about the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  To reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split, one factor that could have helped is if physicists conducting the experiments did not have particular expectations about the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")

  Earlier, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
Thought:
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms.
  The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had been expecting all by-products to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Therefore, reducing the expectations of the physicists with regards to the by-products would have most likely reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Option A is not relevant to the passage.
  Option B matches our thought process and is a possible answer.
  Option C is not relevant to the passage.
  Option D does not really address the expectations of the physicists.
  Option E is not relevant to the passage.
Criticism:
  Option B is plausible, but it is not the only possible answer. Other factors such as better communication between physicists or more sophisticated experimental techniques could have also helped to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the time it took for physicists to realize what they were witnessing.
  Physicists conducted experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium to compile increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Earlier, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
Thought:
  Physicists took a long time to realize they were witnessing nuclear fission, despite compiling increasing evidence from neutron bombardment experiments of uranium. 
  Theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart before the neutron-proton composition had even been experimentally demonstrated.
  Therefore, if physicists had been aware of these calculations, they may have been more receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission and recognized it sooner.
  Choice C suggests that the physicists were not aware of these calculations and would be the most likely option to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize what they were witnessing.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists discovered nuclear fission by bombarding uranium with neutrons. 
  They compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission without realizing what they were witnessing. 
  Theoretical physicists had already produced calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms even before the neutron and proton composition of nuclei was experimentally demonstrated. 
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection between the experimental results and the underlying theoretical concept of nuclear fission.
Thought: 
  Physicists took a long time to realize that atoms were being split despite compiling increasing evidence because they were not even receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission. 
  One way to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split would be to make them more receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission. 
  If the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, then they might have been more open to considering alternative explanations, including the possibility of nuclear fission. 
  Therefore, B is the most likely answer.
Criticism: 
  It is possible that using the same research techniques might have accelerated the discovery of nuclear fission if the techniques were more effective or efficient. 
  Additionally, the physicists may have been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms, but they were not receptive to the possibility in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments. 
  Conducting experiments with substances other than uranium may not have necessarily led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Physicists discovered evidence of nuclear fission through neutron-bombardment experiments on uranium.
  Researchers compiled evidence of nuclear fission without realizing what they were witnessing.
Thought:
  Physicists compiled evidence of nuclear fission without realizing what they were witnessing.
  The identification of the by-products of nuclear fission was hampered by the expectation that they would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  If the physicists had not had this expectation, they might have identified the by-products sooner.
  Therefore, if the physicists conducting the experiments had not had particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they would have been more likely to realize that atoms were being split.
  The answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Criticism:
  This answer appears to be the most likely based on the passage's discussion of the expectations of the physicists conducting the experiments.
  However, it is possible that other factors may have also played a role in the delay in recognizing the phenomenon of nuclear fission.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Three positions are presented and each is elaborated in detail.

  E: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be inferior to the second.
Response 0:
The correct answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. 

Explanation: The passage presents three significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. The first two positions are described as being in opposition to each other, and the third position taken by Dostoyevsky is presented as different from the first two. The passage goes into detail about Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality and the artistic merit of literary works, and how it differs from the radical critics' views. The passage does not show that the third position taken by Dostoyevsky is superior or inferior to the first two positions, but rather that it is different. Therefore, the best answer is B.
Response 1:
The answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. The passage presents three positions on the role of literature in society and how reality should be depicted in literature. The first two positions are presented in contrast to each other, while the third position, which is Dostoyevsky's, is presented as a more nuanced approach that goes deeper than the first two. The passage describes how Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality is different from the radical critics' understanding, and how his definition of "artistic" differs from the utilitarian view of art espoused by the radical critics. Therefore, the passage presents three positions and differentiates the third position from the first two.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoevsky's time.
  The first position believed art was above the present and should not necessarily be useful.
  The second position believed art must find its sources in concrete reality and contribute to the creation of a new society; literature should be useful.
  The third position, which Dostoevsky took, believed that reality was literature's crucial source and that there was no distinction between fantasy and reality. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit".
Thought: 
  The passage presents three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoevsky's time.

  However, his understanding of reality went deeper than the prevailing radical critics' understanding, as he believed there was no distinction between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit".
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
Thought:
  The passage discusses three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoevsky's time.
  The first two positions are presented, and the third position, which is Dostoevsky's, is elaborated in detail.
  The third position is differentiated from the first two in detail.
  The passage does not necessarily show that the third position is superior or inferior to the first two.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Criticism:
  There is no strong criticism for this answer as it accurately represents the organization of the material presented in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
The correct answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. The passage presents three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time. While the first two positions are briefly described, the third position, which Dostoyevsky takes, is elaborated in detail. The passage describes how he understands reality and his approach to literary works. The passage does not indicate that the third position is superior or inferior to the first two, nor does it state that each position is elaborated in detail.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage presents three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The first position maintains that art should be elevated above everyday reality.
  The second position holds that art should be useful and serve a particular political view.
  The third position, which Dostoyevsky takes, is that reality is the crucial source of literature, but reality is not limited to the merely tangible and there is no clear distinction between reality and fantasy.
Thought:
  The passage presents three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The first two positions are presented as opposing each other, while the third position taken by Dostoyevsky is different from both of them.
  The first position maintains that art should be elevated above everyday reality, while the second position holds that it should be useful and serve a particular political view.
  The third position taken by Dostoyevsky is that reality is the crucial source of literature and that there is no clear distinction between reality and fantasy. He also believes that art should not be limited by political views, but should be judged on its artistic merit.
  Therefore, the organization of the material presented in the passage is that three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
  The answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Criticism:
  There is no indication in the passage that the third position taken by Dostoyevsky is shown to be superior or inferior to the first two positions. The passage simply presents the three positions and differentiates the third from the first two.
  Therefore, answers D and E are incorrect.
  Answer A is incorrect because while the three positions are presented, the passage does not elaborate on each one in detail.
  Answer C is incorrect because the third position is differentiated from the second position, not the other way around.

Response 6:
The organization of the material presented in the passage is:
Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Therefore, the answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses three significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position that was different from the first two positions.
  For Dostoyevsky, reality was not limited to what is tangible and there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," according to Dostoyevsky.
Thought:
  The passage presents three significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position that was different from the first two.
  The passage focuses on Dostoyevsky's view of reality and his understanding of artistry.
  The radical critics' view that art must serve a particular political view was criticized by Dostoyevsky.
  The passage does not show that the third position is superior or inferior to the first two.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Criticism:
  There are some parts in the passage that discuss the first two positions, but they are not elaborated in detail.
  The passage focuses mainly on Dostoyevsky's position and his understanding of reality and artistry.
  However, the third position is clearly differentiated from the first two in terms of their understanding of reality and the role of art.
  Therefore, the answer is a reasonable interpretation of the organization of the material presented in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
The organization of the material presented in the passage is:
Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.

The first two positions are presented in the first few sentences of the passage, and the third position, held by Dostoyevsky, is presented in detail throughout the rest of the passage. Dostoyevsky's position is differentiated from the first two positions by his belief that reality is not limited to what is tangible and that the boundaries of the real world can be exploded through literature. The passage also indicates that Dostoyevsky does not believe that the artistic merit of a work should be subsumed by its usefulness. Therefore, the best answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
The answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. The passage presents three positions on the role of literature: one that sees art as above reality, one that sees art as useful for creating a new society, and one that sees reality as the crucial source for art but also recognizes the importance of the fantastic. The passage then focuses on Dostoyevsky's position, which is the third position, and explains how it differs from the first two.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passages discuss evolutionary psychology and its implications for human behavior.
  Passage A argues that altruistic behavior can be explained by the reproductive benefits it provides to related individuals.
  Passage B is critical of evolutionary psychology, calling it a "conspiracy theory" and arguing that it overstates the role of genetic self-interest in human behavior.
Thought: 
  Passage B argues that evolutionary psychology is a "conspiracy theory" because it imputes hidden motives to human behavior.
  The author claims that evolutionary psychologists assume that all behavior can be explained by genetic self-interest.
  The idea that genes promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish is an example of this kind of imputation.
  Therefore, D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish is the assertion from passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
Criticism: 
  This interpretation is reasonable, but one could also argue that other assertions from passage A, such as the claim that identification and empathy arose in response to shared genetic material, also exemplify the idea of imputing hidden motives to behavior.
  In addition, while passage B is critical of evolutionary psychology, it is not clear that it rejects all of its claims outright; it may be more accurate to say that the passage is urging caution in interpreting these claims.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses how evolutionary psychology seeks to explain human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution.
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory that attributes hidden motives to human behavior.
Thought: 
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory that attributes hidden motives to human behavior.
  The idea that genes promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish is an example of a hidden motive.
  Therefore, the assertion that best exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and how it explains human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology by calling it a "conspiracy theory."
Thought: 
  The author of Passage B believes that evolutionary psychology is a "conspiracy theory" because it attributes hidden, ulterior motives (i.e. the proliferation of genes) to human behavior that people are not aware of or do not acknowledge.
  Passage A states that genes may promote their own self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  Therefore, the assertion that most clearly exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the theory of evolutionary psychology and how it can explain apparently altruistic behavior through the proliferation of genes.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology by calling it a conspiracy theory, which imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) to individuals who may not be aware of such interest.
Thought: 
  The assertion that best exemplifies the author of Passage B's criticism of evolutionary psychology is the one in which evolutionary psychology imputes interests to individuals who may not be aware of such interest. 
  The statement that matches this description is "genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish."
  Therefore, the answer is D: "genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish."
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. The statement that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish exemplifies the author's criticism of evolutionary psychology because it imputes an interest to individuals who may not be aware of such interest.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the subject of evolutionary psychology.
  The author of Passage A explains how evolutionary psychology accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual.
  The author suggests that genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a kind of conspiracy theory that imputes an interest to the agent of the behavior that the agent does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of.
Thought:
  The author of Passage A suggest that genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  The idea that genes are promoting their self-propagation could be seen as a kind of "hidden agenda" or "conspiracy" from the perspective of Passage B.
  Therefore, assertion D most clearly exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes the theory of evolution and the role of identification and empathy in evolving altruistic behavior.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory for imputing an interest in gene proliferation to behavior.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a type of conspiracy theory because it implies that behavior is shaped by a hidden interest in gene proliferation.
  The author implies that this assumption is unfounded and that behavior can be motivated by other interests, such as concern for one's children.
  Therefore, the assertion in Passage A that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish is an example of the conspiracy theory-like assumption criticized in Passage B.
  The answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  Your thinking is correct. 
  The passage A describes how genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology as a type of conspiracy theory for assuming that behavior is shaped by a hidden interest in gene proliferation. 
  Therefore, the assertion in Passage A that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish is an example of the conspiracy theory-like assumption criticized in Passage B. 
  Your answer is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explores how evolutionary psychology explains human behavior through evolution.
  The author of Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory that imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage B is critical of evolutionary psychology because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge.
  Among the assertions in Passage A, the idea that genes promoting their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish is an example of what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory.
  This is because the idea suggests that genes operate through an instinctive mechanism that appears unselfish to promote their self-propagation, which the agent of the behavior may not be aware of or acknowledge.
  This aligns with the author of Passage B's criticism that evolutionary psychology imputes an interest that the agent of the behavior may not openly acknowledge.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  The other assertions in Passage A are not examples of what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory.
  While Passage A examines the role of evolution in explaining human behavior, it does not necessarily suggest that the agent of the behavior is not aware of or acknowledges the interest in gene proliferation.
  Thus, it is not a conspiracy theory in the way that Passage B suggests.
  However, the author of Passage B does not provide enough evidence to substantiate the claim that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A is discussing the evolution of altruistic behavior and how it can be explained through the theory of evolution.
  The passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory.
  The author of passage B argues that the interests that explain behavior are multiple, and identifying a single interest as the explanation for a given behavior is difficult.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This means that seemingly altruistic behaviors may actually be motivated by a selfish interest in propagating one's genes.
  This kind of explanation is similar to a conspiracy theory, in which a hidden group or interest is behind seemingly unrelated events.
  Therefore, assertion D in passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the principles of evolutionary psychology and how they explain behavior.
  Passage B argues that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it imputes an interest (proliferation of genes) to behavior that is not necessarily acknowledged by the individual.
Thought:
  The author of Passage B argues that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it imputes interests to behavior that may not necessarily be acknowledged by the individual.
  One of the assertions in Passage A that falls in line with this argument is that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This assertion suggests that seemingly selfless behavior may actually be serving a selfish genetic interest.
  Therefore, D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
Criticism:
  There is no flaw in the logic or reasoning of the thought process.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the theory of evolution as it pertains to human behavior.
  The author of Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory".
  A: Passage A explains that evolutionary psychologists examine human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint.
  B: Passage A discusses the problem of altruism in the theory of evolution.
  C: Passage A defines altruism as behavior in which an individual expends resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Passage A suggests that genes may promote their own self-propagation through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Passage A discusses the fact that early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Thought: 
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory".
  The term "conspiracy theory" suggests that the theory is based on hidden or unknown motivations.
  Passage A discusses the idea that genes may promote their own self-propagation through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  This idea could be seen as an example of a hidden motivation that explains behavior.
  Therefore, D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, is the assertion from Passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
Criticism: 
  The term "conspiracy theory" may have a negative connotation, suggesting that evolutionary psychology is discredited or unsubstantiated.
  However, Passage B does not provide evidence for why evolutionary psychology should be considered a conspiracy theory.
  Additionally, the assertion from Passage A that genes may promote their own self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish is not necessarily a hidden or unknown motivation.
  This assertion is based on the theory of evolution and is supported by scientific evidence.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses traditional modes of autobiography among Native American cultures prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures.
  The passage points out that scholars who study these autobiographies tend to focus on written documents that are produced through collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native American collaborators.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native American collaborators in producing written autobiographies.
  The emphasis is on the collaborative nature of the process, which involves individuals from different cultural backgrounds working together to produce a single written document.
  The answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that "bicultural composite authorship" refers to collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native American collaborators in producing written autobiographies.
  However, the phrase implies that the written document is a composite of two cultures, not just edited by one culture.
  Therefore, a better answer may be B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholars who study Native American autobiographical expression and the different modes of communication used by Native Americans to express their personal history.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used in line 5.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" suggests that the autobiographies of Native Americans were created through a collaborative effort between members of two cultures.
  The phrase "composite authorship" implies that multiple individuals were involved in creating the autobiographies.
  The phrase "bicultural" suggests that the individuals involved were from different cultures.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" most accurately conveys the idea that Native American autobiographies were created through a collaborative effort between members of two cultures.
  The answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  Your interpretation of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is incorrect. 
  The phrase does not imply that each of the people involved contributed in the same way. It does not suggest that the identity of the authors cannot be determined.
  Instead, the phrase suggests that the autobiographies were created through a collaboration between members of two cultures, with one member originating from one culture and the other from the other culture. 
  The answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholars' focus on "as-told-to" life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  The scholars have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples.
Thought: 
  "Bicultural composite authorship" refers to the collaboration between non-Native American collaborators and Native American subjects in the creation of autobiographies.
  The collaboration produces a finished product that reflects both cultures, hence the term "bicultural composite".
  Therefore, the answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The answer is incorrect.
  The passage states that the "as-told-to" life histories were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the collaboration between non-Native American collaborators and Native American subjects in the creation of autobiographies.
  However, the answer choice B states that both collaborators contribute in the same way to the finished product, which is not mentioned in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is not B.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the focus of scholars on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators and how traditional native modes of communicating personal history, including oral and visual representations, have been overlooked.
  The passage introduces the term "bicultural composite authorship" in line 5.
Thought:
  The term "bicultural" suggests that two cultures are involved in the authorship.
  The term "composite" suggests that more than one person is involved in the authorship.
  The phrase "authorship" suggests that the work is written.
  Putting it all together, "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a written work that is created collaboratively by two people from different cultures.
  The work is not necessarily limited to as-told-to life histories, but the passage suggests that such works are often created this way.
  The work is not necessarily limited to Native American traditions, but the passage suggests that such works are often created this way.
  Therefore, the answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product. 
Criticism: 
  The term "bicultural composite authorship" does not necessarily imply that the work is created collaboratively in the same way by each collaborator.
  The term "bicultural composite authorship" could be interpreted more broadly to mean that the work is a product of two cultures, without specifying the nature of the collaboration.
  This interpretation would include works written by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture, as in choice D.
  However, the passage does not provide evidence to support this interpretation specifically.
  Therefore, the original answer of B could still be considered the most accurate choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of studying Native American autobiographies that were produced through "bicultural composite authorship."
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used in line 5.
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to autobiographies that were produced with the collaboration of both Native American and non-Native American authors.
  The phrase does not suggest that the autobiography was based on artifacts or oral traditions of another culture.
  The phrase does not imply that the autobiography was written by two authors who contributed equally to the finished product.
  The phrase does not indicate that the identities of the authors cannot be determined.
  The phrase does not suggest that the autobiography was edited and revised by a non-Native American author.
  Therefore, the best answer is B.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explain whether the two authors who contribute to the autobiographies collaborate in the same way or not.
  However, the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" suggests that at least two authors are involved in the production of the autobiography, and that they come from different cultures.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of focusing on written, as-told-to life histories of Native Americans as a form of autobiography.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe the written, as-told-to life histories.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" describes written, as-told-to life histories of Native Americans.
  These life histories are written collaboratively by Native Americans and non-Native Americans.
  Therefore, the most accurate description of "bicultural composite authorship" is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The passage suggests that the written, as-told-to life histories of Native Americans "emerged from" bicultural composite authorship, implying that they were not necessarily written collaboratively by two people.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is not defined in the passage itself, so the answer may be subject to interpretation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limited focus of scholars on as-told-to life histories of Native Americans.
  The scholars have mostly overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  The passage introduces the concept of "bicultural composite authorship" to describe the as-told-to life histories of Native Americans.
Thought:
  "Bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe the as-told-to life histories of Native Americans.
  These life histories were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  These collaborators were from a different culture than the Native American individuals whose life histories were being recorded.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a collaboration between two different cultures in the creation of an as-told-to life history.
  Answer: B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The answer is incorrect because it assumes that both authors contributed in the same way to the finished product.
  The passage only mentions that one culture solicited, translated, recorded, and edited the life histories of the other culture.
  Therefore, answer choice B is not the best answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the study of Native American autobiographies and the limitations of focusing only on written documents.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe the written life histories that most scholars have focused on.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" seems to suggest that these written life histories are the product of collaboration between Native American and non-Native American authors.
  The term "composite" suggests that multiple authors are involved.
  "Bicultural" suggests that the authors belong to different cultures.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" most accurately conveys the idea that these written life histories are the product of collaboration between Native American and non-Native American authors.
  The answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" does not necessarily imply that both authors contribute in the same way to the finished product.
  The phrase does not clarify the relative contributions of each author.
  Additionally, the phrase does not specify that the authors are of different cultures.
  The passage suggests that the authors may be of the same culture, but the product of their collaboration reflects the influence of both cultures.
  Therefore, answer choice B is not the best answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used in the passage to refer to written documents that contain the life histories of Native Americans.
  A: This answer choice refers to artifacts and oral traditions, which are not what "bicultural composite authorship" means in the context of the passage.
  B: This answer choice refers to two people contributing equally to a finished product, which is not what "bicultural composite authorship" means in the context of the passage.
  C: This answer choice suggests that the identities of the authors cannot be determined, which is not what "bicultural composite authorship" means in the context of the passage.
  D: This answer choice accurately describes the meaning of "bicultural composite authorship" in the passage.
  E: This answer choice refers to written documents based on oral communication, which is not what "bicultural composite authorship" means in the context of the passage.
Thought:
  The term "bicultural composite authorship" is used in the passage to describe written documents that contain the life histories of Native Americans.
  The documents were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The term suggests that the documents are the result of collaboration between two cultures.
  The best answer should describe the idea of two cultures coming together to create a single written document.
  Based on this reasoning, D accurately describes the meaning of "bicultural composite authorship" in the context of the passage.
Criticism:
  There are no significant flaws in the facts, logic, or reasoning.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of focusing on "as-told-to life histories" that were produced through "bicultural composite authorship." 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" appears in line 5 of the passage.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" suggests that the life histories being studied are the product of collaboration between people of different cultures.
  "Bicultural" implies that there are two cultures involved.
  "Composite" suggests that the final product is made up of contributions from both cultures.
  "Authorship" implies that the life histories have been written down.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" means that the life histories have been written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
  Thus, the correct answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The thought process is sound and the answer matches the definition of "bicultural composite authorship" provided in the passage.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon
  C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  D: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to introduce the main topic to be discussed
  E: to introduce the main topic to be discussed to present a view that will be argued against
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the paradox of the relationship between happiness and wealth, and how the phenomenon of rivalry impacts happiness.
  Passage B discusses why earning more makes people happier and the desire to create value that motivates people to pursue wealth.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in both passages. 
Thought: 
  In Passage A, the Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned to provide evidence for the idea that people's happiness is affected by their relative position compared to others. 
  In Passage B, the study is mentioned to provide evidence for the idea that people's happiness is driven by the desire to create value, not just to have more than others. 
  These are two distinct but related explanations for why people care about their income relative to others.
  Therefore, the authors of each passage mention the study to provide evidence for their respective ideas.
  The correct answer is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. Both passages mention the Solnick and Hemenway study to support different explanations for why people are motivated by income and how it relates to happiness.
  There is no evidence to support any of the other choices, and they are not related to the content of the passages.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the paradox between wealth and happiness, and presents two phenomena of habituation and rivalry as explanations.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the music of Arnold Schoenberg and how it evolved over time.
  It talks about how his music was initially rooted in late-Romantic music and then evolved into nontonal music.
  It also highlights Schoenberg's technical mastery and his development of the 12-tone technique.
  The passage emphasizes that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that it expresses emotional states that music had not recorded before.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the evolution of Schoenberg's music and highlights his technical mastery and innovations.
  It also emphasizes that Schoenberg's music expresses emotional states that were previously unrecorded in music.
  The main point of the passage is that Schoenberg's music, though not always well-received, is worthy of admiration for its expressive range and innovative techniques.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage discusses the evolution of Schoenberg's music, his technical mastery, and his innovations.
  However, the passage emphasizes that Schoenberg's music is essential because it expresses emotional states that were previously unrecorded in music.
  This aspect of his music is not included in choice B or D.
  Choice A is too narrow and does not reflect the positive aspects of Schoenberg's music that the passage highlights.
  Choice E is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the rate of acceptance of Schoenberg's music compared to Beethoven's music.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.
  B: It serves as the author's logical conclusion from data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development.
  C: It forms part of a speculative hypothesis that the author presents for its interest in relation to the main topic rather than as part of an argument.
  D: It serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.
  E: It forms part of the author's concession that certain factors complicate the argument presented in the first two paragraphs.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy
  D: conviction that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives
  E: eagerness to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border
  B: a study focusing on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.

Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the concerns and debates regarding intellectual property protection and patenting in the biotechnology industry.
  Researchers fear that access to materials may be restricted due to patent enforcement or contractual agreements.
  Some researchers fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials.
  However, granting a patent does not imply granting the right to deny access.
  Patent litigation is an expensive and usually initiated to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  There has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
Thought: 
  The article indicates that researchers may fear that a patent holder may refuse to provide access to materials, such as cell lines, if a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is not undertaken. However, the article also states that patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and is usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Additionally, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Therefore, it is likely that the researcher will not be held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  The article also indicates that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate, which could mean that the corporation holding the patent may be willing to collaborate with the researcher to produce new discoveries.
  Therefore, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued. 
  Answer: D
Response 2:
Knowledge:

  It is a misconception that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access.
  Patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  There has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
Thought:
  The article argues that concerns about patent holders trying to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement is questionable.
  It is more likely that patents will spur basic research because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  Therefore, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  The article also suggests that patent holders or owners of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer or license agreement is undertaken.
  Therefore, it is possible that the researcher may not be able to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
Criticism:
  While it is true that patent litigation is expensive and patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate, the article does not address the specifics of the situation where a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation.

Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the debate surrounding patenting biological materials in biotechnology and its perceived threat to basic research.
  Biotechnology researchers increasingly believe that intellectual property protection is necessary for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential.
  The article mentions concerns about restrictions on access to research materials arising from patent enforcement or contractual agreements.
  Some researchers fear that patent holders may attempt or threaten to enjoin further research through legal action for patent infringement, or refuse to make materials available unless costly agreements are undertaken.
  The article notes that researchers who oppose biotechnology patents may confuse patent rights with control of access to biological materials.
  The article suggests that patents may actually spur innovation and provide scientists with compelling incentives to innovate.
Thought: 
  The article notes that patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and is usually initiated to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  The article also notes that there has been a tradition among judges to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Therefore, it seems likely that a university researcher conducting basic, noncommercial research involving patented cell lines may not be held liable for patent infringement unless the corporation holding the patent has a strong market position or exclusive patent license.
  It is also possible that the corporation may offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
  However, it is unlikely that the corporation will demand a prohibitively high payment for the use of the cell lines, as this would discourage innovation and go against the article's suggestion that patents provide compelling incentives to innovate.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Biotechnology researchers increasingly support intellectual property protection.
  Restrictions on access to research materials arise either from enforcement of patent rights or through operation of a contractual agreement.
  Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement.
  Patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  There has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
Thought: 
  The author argues that patents generally do not hinder basic research and that researchers who want to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation have a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if they conduct the research and are subsequently sued. The reason for this is that there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement, and patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Criticism: 
  None of the choices are completely correct. Answer A states that the researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use, but the passage does not support this claim. Answer B states that the corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission, but the passage argues that whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher conducting basic and noncommercial research is questionable. Answer C states that the university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent, but the passage does not support this claim. Answer E states that the corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product, but the passage does not support this claim.
Action: Answer("D")

  The author notes that whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. 
  Therefore, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued, as long as the research is basic and noncommercial.
  The passage does not suggest that the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for the researcher to use the cell lines, or that the university will prohibit the research.
  The passage also does not suggest that the corporation holding the patent will offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Criticism: 
  It is possible that the corporation holding the patent may attempt or threaten to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement, which would make it difficult for the researcher to conduct the research.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to create images of the brain's metabolic activity during cognitive tasks.
  The method subtracts a baseline measurement of metabolic activity from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  This method can create the false impression that brain functions are neatly localized and separate.
  The modular theory of mind holds that mental processes can be analyzed into distinct modules instantiated in localized brain regions, but this view may be flawed.
Thought: 
  The author argues against the modular theory of mind, which holds that mental processes can be separated into distinct modules instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The author notes that the subtractive method used in FMRI masks distributed brain functions and creates the illusion of neat functional localization.
  The author suggests that the use of the subtractive method in FMRI does not strongly support the modular theory of mind.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with statement B, that the subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about the use of neuroimaging in psychology, specifically the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
  The subtractive method involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task in order to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with that task.
Thought:
  The author argues against the modular theory of mind and suggests that the subtractive method produces an illusion of neat functional localization that supports the modular theory.
  The author also criticizes the subtractive method for obscuring the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control and on-task conditions.
  The passage does not suggest that empirical results derived using the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications.
  The passage also does not suggest that the subtractive method supports Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  While the passage criticizes the popular press for claiming that emotions are seated in the amygdala and reason in the prefrontal cortex, it does not suggest that the subtractive method shows this to be false.
  The passage suggests that the subtractive method creates an illusion of neat functional localization, which supports the modular theory of mind.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans, specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), to study mental activity.
  The FMRI subtractive method subtracts a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement to produce a differential measurement of metabolic activity associated with a cognitive task.
  The author criticizes the modular theory of mind, which posits that mental processes can be separated into distinct modules localized in specific brain regions.
Thought: 
  The author criticizes the modular theory of mind, but notes that brain scans using the subtractive method show well-defined areas "lighting up" in response to cognitive tasks.
  The author notes that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the brain functions as a distributed system.
  The author may suggest that the subtractive method, while producing striking images, may not necessarily support the modular theory of mind.
  It is unlikely that the author would suggest that empirical results derived using the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications.
  It is also unlikely that the author would suggest that the subtractive method shows that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is not a fundamental misconception of the method, but rather the interpretation of the method.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
Criticism: 
  The author does not explicitly state that the subtractive method supports Uttal's view, but rather that the method may not necessarily support the modular theory of mind.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the subtractive method in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
  The subtractive method involves taking a baseline measurement in a control condition and then subtracting it from a measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task.
  The result is an image that supposedly shows the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought:
  The author argues that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The author suggests that the method creates an illusion of neat functional localization that supports the modular theory of mind.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with choice D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the subtractive method in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) and its use in revealing well-defined areas of the brain that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks.
  The passage also critiques the modular theory of mind, arguing that mental processes are not decomposable into independent modules localized in distinct areas of the brain.
Thought: 
  The author critiques the modular theory of mind and suggests that the subtractive method creates an illusion of neat functional localization in the brain. Therefore, the author would not agree with statement A that empirical results derived using the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications. Statement B is also too extreme and not clearly supported by the passage. There is no explicit discussion of angry emotions and the amygdala in the passage, so statement C is not supported. Statement D is closer to the author's argument, but it is not entirely accurate. The author suggests that the subtractive method seems to support the modular theory of mind, not that it strongly supports it. Finally, statement E is not accurate as the passage discusses how the subtractive method actually works and what it depicts. 
Criticism: 
  The passage is critical of the modular theory of mind and the idea of neat functional localization in the brain, but it does not explicitly state the author's opinion on the subtractive method. Therefore, it is difficult to choose an answer with certainty based on the passage alone.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology, not for medical diagnosis.
  The subtractive method is used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to create a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain in response to a cognitive task.
  The subtractive method subtracts a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while a subject is performing a cognitive task, thereby highlighting the differential rate of oxygen use associated with the task.
Thought:
  The author is critical of the modular theory of mind, which posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The author argues that the modular theory of mind is problematic because mental activity and the physical processes that constitute it may not be decomposable into independent modules.
  The author notes that the subtractive method creates a false impression of functional localization by masking the fact that the entire brain is active in both control and task conditions.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with choice B, which suggests that the subtractive method supports Uttal's view that mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity.
Criticism:
  There is no basis in the passage to suggest that the author would agree with choice A, C, D, or E.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the subtractive method, which is used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to produce brain scans of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The subtractive method involves taking a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task and subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought: 
  The author argues that the subtractive method produces brain scans that may create a false impression of neat functional localization, which may support the modular theory of mind. However, the entire brain is active in both conditions, and the method may obscure the fact that mental processes are not decomposable into independent modules. Therefore, the author is unlikely to agree with statements that suggest that the subtractive method is a valid way to support the modular theory of mind or that its empirical results are invalid for medical applications. 
  The author is also unlikely to agree with statements that suggest that the subtractive method shows that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala or that the view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
  The author is most likely to agree with statement B, which suggests that the subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide direct support for statement B, but the author does suggest that the modular theory of mind may be flawed and that mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. The author also suggests that the subtractive method may create a false impression of neat functional localization, which supports the idea that mental processes are not decomposable into independent modules. Therefore, the author is more likely to agree with statement B than with any of the other statements.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology as a research method.
  The modular theory of mind posits that mental activity can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, which are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  William Uttal argues that mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  The subtractive method is used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to produce a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The baseline measurement in the control condition is subtracted from the on-task measurement to produce a map of the differential rate of oxygen use associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought:
  The author argues that the modular theory of mind may not be entirely accurate and that mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  The author also notes that the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, but that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with the statement that the subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  The other statements are either incorrect or not supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology.
  The subtractive method is used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to produce images of the brain at work.
  The FMRI measures the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain while a subject performs a cognitive task, and then subtracts a baseline measurement taken during a control condition.
Thought: 
  The author criticizes the modular theory of mind and argues that the subtractive method produces an illusion of neat functional localization in the brain, despite the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the author would not agree that the subtractive method strongly supports the modular theory of mind.
  The author also argues that the subtractive method may obscure distributed brain functions and produce a false impression of cognitive task localization.
  Therefore, the author would not agree that empirical results derived using the method are valid for medical applications.
  The author does not discuss the relationship between the subtractive method and Uttal's view of mental processes.
  The author does not discuss the specific relationship between the subtractive method and emotions seated in the amygdala.
  The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is consistent with the author's discussion of the method.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement E: "The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method."
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage that the author believes there is a fundamental misconception of the subtractive method.
  Instead, the author criticizes the way in which the subtractive method is used to create an illusion of neat functional localization in the brain.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is not E, but is instead D: "The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized."

This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology as a research method and its relation with the modular theory of mind.
  The modular theory of mind holds that mental activity can be broken down into independent modules, but this may not be accurate.
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  In the case of FMRI, what is actually depicted is the differential rate of oxygen use between baseline and on-task conditions.
Thought: 
  The modular theory of mind may not be accurate as it suggests that mental activity can be broken down into independent modules, but mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. However, what is actually depicted is the differential rate of oxygen use between baseline and on-task conditions.
  Based on this, the statement that most strongly supported by the passage is that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  Therefore, the answer is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Criticism: 
  The other statements are not supported by the passage.
  Option A says that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain, but the passage suggests that this may not be accurate.
  Option B says that the modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero, but this is not discussed in the passage.
  Option D says that the baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times, but this is not discussed in the passage.
  Option E talks about the subtractive method showing several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity when a brain scan subject experiences anger, but this is not mentioned in the passage.

  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise that the validity of neuroimaging in psychology research depends on.
  The modular theory of mind presupposes that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The validity of the modular theory of mind is challenged by the idea that mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), a brain scan is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI actually depicts the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement.
Thought: 
  The passage is critical of the modular theory of mind because it is based on a false premise.
  The modular theory of mind presupposes that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules or components, and that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.

  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology.
  The modular theory of mind is the idea that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  William Uttal suggests that mental processes may not be decomposable into independent modules, but rather are likely to be properties of general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a type of brain scan that produces a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI can be interpreted as a map of the differential rate of oxygen use during a cognitive task compared to a baseline measurement taken in a control condition.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind may not be valid.
  While brain scans do reveal well-defined areas that "light up" during cognitive tasks, this is a result of the subtractive method used to interpret FMRI scans.
  The entire brain is active in both control and task conditions, and the subtractive method obscures this fact by subtracting out all distributed brain functions except those involved in the cognitive task. 
  Therefore, it is most strongly supported that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification is reliable and has an exceedingly low error rate, and that there are uniform standards for fingerprint examiners to follow.

Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.

Thought: 
  The passage suggests that perfume-making is a legitimate form of art.
  The author compares the process of making perfume to the process of painting, suggesting that both involve the careful combination of different elements to create a work of art.
  The author also suggests that perfumes can evoke memories and emotions in the same way that other works of art can.
  However, the author also notes that the commercialization of the perfume industry has led to a decline in the quality of perfumes, which may be a barrier to their recognition as a legitimate art form.
  The passage does not provide any support for the idea that some forms of art are superior to others, that a work of art will inevitably fail if created for commercial success, or that the best works of art improve with age.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfume making, focusing on the creative process and the impact on senses.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that perfume making can be considered a form of art, just like painting, literature, architecture, and music.
  The parallels between painting and perfume making are highlighted, including the use of natural/synthetic pigments/compounds and the layering of these elements to create a final product that changes over time.
  The creative process of both painting and perfume making can evoke memories and produce an aesthetic experience.
  The passage also criticizes the commercialization of perfume making by large corporations and its negative impact on the quality of fine perfume.
  However, the passage does not support any statement about the superiority of some forms of art over others or that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for commercial success.
  The most support is provided for the statement that a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes (Option A).
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfume creation, with both being considered sister arts.
  Painters use natural and synthetic pigments with media to create a painting, while perfumers use natural and synthetic chemical compounds to create a fragrance.
  Both mediums change over time, with oil paintings becoming more transparent, and fragrances changing and developing as the substances evaporate at different rates.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the creation of art through smell and the parallels between painting and perfume creation.
  It suggests that a talented perfumer can create an imaginary world no less powerful than that of a great composer or painter.

  It also supports the idea that art involves the harmonious combination of many small sensations, as it describes how perfumers experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements to produce various sensations.
  However, the passage does not support the idea that all art created for commercial success will inevitably fail, as it does not make any blanket statements about the relationship between art and commercial success. 
  The passage also does not address whether the best works of art necessarily improve with age or whether some forms of art are superior to others.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfume-making, including the use of natural and synthetic compounds to create a work of art that stimulates the senses.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that perfume-making is a form of art that is often undervalued because it is produced by large corporations who prioritize profits over the quality of the product.
  The passage also suggests that perfumes have the ability to create an aesthetic experience through the combination of olfactory elements that evoke memories and emotions.
  While the passage does not explicitly state that some forms of art are superior to others, it does suggest that perfume-making is an art form that is not taken as seriously as other forms, despite its potential for creating powerful aesthetic experiences.
  Therefore, the answer is not E.
  The passage does not mention anything about whether a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for commercial success, so the answer is not C.
  The passage does not provide any evidence to suggest that the best works of art improve with age, so the answer is not D.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Stealing thunder is a courtroom strategy where a lawyer reveals negative information about their client before that information is revealed by the opposing lawyer.
  The technique is believed to be effective by many lawyers because it can create an image of credibility, help preview and alert jurors to upcoming testimony, and frame the evidence positively.
Thought:
  The question is asking for a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
  The passage mentions that revealing damaging information early creates an image of credibility and that jurors are more likely to be critical when warned of an upcoming persuasive attempt.
  Based on this, a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder is jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.
  The answer is D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.
  D: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he condueted.
  E: Though he composed and condueted primarily jazz, he also composed some music of other genres.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.

Explanation:
The main focus of the passage is the discovery of prions and their unique ability to reproduce themselves without genetic material, leading to the development of CJD. Option A discusses the mechanism of protein reproduction in general and is too broad. Option C is not supported by the passage as research has yet to fully explore the connection between prions and other neurological conditions. Option D is also incorrect as the passage explains that the discovery of prions was initially met with skepticism but subsequent research has supported the conclusion. Option E is a restatement of the main point of the passage and is therefore correct but not the most accurate. So, Option B is the most accurate as it accurately describes both the discovery of prions and their unique ability to reproduce without genetic material.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use
  D: detectable using brain scans enhanced by means of the subtractive method
  E: features of a general mental activity that is spread throughout the brain

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that behavior is caused by the brain, rather than free will, and that this should change the focus of the criminal-justice system from retribution to deterrence.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how neuroscientists view behavior as wholly determined by brain activity and that this should change the way we think about law.
  Passage A suggests that people may not have free choice, but rather their actions are the result of brain activity that they cannot fully control.
  Passage A suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterrence rather than punishment.
  Passage B discusses how concepts of determinism and free will can be reconciled.
  Passage B distinguishes between free actions (caused by internal sources) and constrained actions (caused by external sources).
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses how behavior is determined by the brain, calling into question the idea of free choice.
  Passage B discusses the distinction between free and constrained actions as it relates to determinism and free will.
  Mental disorder is discussed in Passage A as a potential cause of behavior, but in Passage B, the concept of constrained actions explicitly refers to it.

  The concept of causality is discussed in both passages.
  Self-delusion is explicitly discussed in Passage A, but not in Passage B.
  Moral responsibility is not discussed in Passage B, but is central to the discussion in Passage A.
  Therefore, the concept that plays a role in the argument of Passage B but not in that of Passage A is B: free choice.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that behavior is caused by the brain, and that a person's sense of choice and free will may be an illusion.
  As a result, retribution should not be the main goal of punishment in the criminal justice system.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world, and distinguishes between free and constrained actions.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that a person's behavior is caused by the brain, and that free will may be an illusion. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world, and distinguishes between free and constrained actions.

Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that behavior is determined by the operations of the brain.
  Neuroscience findings suggest that people may not be making free and rational choices.
  The criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  Passage B argues that free will can coexist with determinism.
  Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" distinguishes between free and constrained actions.
  Constrained actions are caused by external sources and free actions are caused by internal sources.
Thought:
  Both passages discuss the role of the brain in behavior.
  Passage A suggests that people may not be making free and rational choices.
  Passage B distinguishes between free and constrained actions and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Mental disorder is discussed in passage B as an example of a constraint on actions.
  Free choice is discussed in both passages.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: Passage A argues that the operations of the brain cause behavior and that people may not be making free and rational choices. It suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing bad people. Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism and discusses the distinction between free actions and constrained actions.
Thought: Passage A discusses the idea that people may not be making free and rational choices, and passage B discusses the distinction between free and constrained actions. Mental disorder is mentioned in passage B, but the idea of it being a concept that plays a role in passage B but not in passage A is not immediately apparent. Causality is discussed in both passages, and self-delusion and moral responsibility are discussed in passage A.
Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.
Criticism: The distinction between free and constrained actions is discussed in passage B, but the idea of free choice is not explicitly mentioned. However, the concept of free choice is related to the distinction between free and constrained actions, as free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will, and people can act freely even in a deterministic world. Therefore, it can be argued that free choice does play a role in the argument of passage B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that behavior is caused by the operations of the brain, suggesting that free will and moral responsibility may be illusory.
  Passage B argues that free will can coexist with determinism, distinguishing between free actions and constrained actions.
  A: Mental disorder is mentioned in Passage B as one way that actions can be constrained.

  C: Causality is a key concept in both passages.
  D: Self-delusion is mentioned in Passage A as a possibility, but not discussed in Passage B.
  E: Moral responsibility is discussed in Passage A as a concept that should be abandoned in favor of deterrence, while Passage B does not discuss moral responsibility.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues against the existence of free will and moral responsibility, suggesting that all behavior is caused by the brain.
  Passage B argues that free will can coexist with determinism, distinguishing between free actions and constrained actions.
  Mental disorder is mentioned in Passage B as one way that actions can be constrained, but is not mentioned in Passage A.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: According to the passage, which one of the following was true of the physics community during the 1930s?
Choices:
  A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: It reevaluated caleulations indicating that atoms could be split

  D: The passage does not indicate that uranium atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: The passage mentions the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but does not suggest that the physics community specifically recognized these dangers.
Thought: 
  The passage describes the physics community's gradual discovery of nuclear fission, starting with Italian physicists bombarding uranium with neutrons in 1934.
  Researchers compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission but did not recognize what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner made the crucial theoretical connection that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms, and she coined the term "nuclear fission".
  Therefore, it seems that the physics community did not immediately recognize the significance of the evidence they were observing, and only later made the theoretical connection that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.

  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
  Earlier, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart.
Thought: 
  The physicists involved in the discovery of nuclear fission did not recognize what they were witnessing at first.
  They compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission between 1934 and 1939.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
  Some theoretical physicists produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart before the discovery of nuclear fission.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Which one of the following is most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" (line 62)?
Choices:
  A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939
  B: the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938
  C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium
  D: the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus
  E: the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long

  Therefore, the "relevant evidence" mentioned in line 62 is the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism:
  This is the correct answer based on the passage, as the clear chemical evidence provided the missing link that helped Meitner recognize the significance of the data.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the evidence that led up to it.
  The author discusses "the relevant evidence" in line 62.
Thought: 
  The relevant evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission is what Meitner recognized when she realized that Hahn's results meant that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  This evidence is described earlier in the passage, particularly in the discussion of the substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium is part of this evidence, but it is not the whole story.
  Therefore, the answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. The author does indeed discuss the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission, and this evidence includes the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.

  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, recognizing that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
Thought: 
  The relevant evidence was present for some time but lacked mainly the right conceptual link.
  The author discusses several pieces of evidence, including the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium, the radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, and the clear chemical evidence of barium's production from neutron bombardment of uranium.
  However, the evidence that had been present but lacked the right conceptual link was the fact that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  Therefore, the answer is not any of the specific pieces of evidence mentioned in the choices, but rather the overarching realization that uranium atoms were being split through neutron bombardment.
  The best match for this is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism: 
  The other answer choices mention specific pieces of evidence that were discussed in the passage, but they do not capture the crucial realization that was lacking.
  However, it could also be argued that the evidence that was "present for some time" refers specifically to the radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium and the clear chemical evidence of barium's production from neutron bombardment of uranium, which had gone unrecognized until Meitner made the connection.
  In this case, C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium would be the most equivalent to the relevant evidence.

  Therefore, the most nearly equivalent to "the relevant evidence" would be the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted between 1934 and 1939 that showed nuclear fission had been achieved but not recognized.
  The answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the article that Meitner's specific experiments were the "relevant evidence" or that the fact that barium was produced was the "relevant evidence."
  While the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus was a crucial piece of evidence, it was not the only evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Therefore, options B, C, D, and E are not the most nearly equivalent to "the relevant evidence."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses how scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934, when a group of Italian physicists first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  Meitner recognized that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms, and coined the term "nuclear fission".
Thought:
  The author mentions that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
  This suggests that the relevant evidence was related to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical link and recognized that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence is most likely the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, which provided the evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  The other options do not seem related to the evidence of nuclear fission.
Criticism:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  C: Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
  E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Roy Lichtenstein's contributions to pop art, a movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings by using comic book styles.
  The passage also explains that Lichtenstein's work managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody.
  The passage further describes Lichtenstein's work as part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and as displaying an impulse toward realism.
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as displaying a deliberate naivete intended as a response to the excess of sophistication in some other pop artists.
  The author also indicates that Lichtenstein's work exuded an inner sweetness and a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
  If Lichtenstein attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s or praised contemporary or early abstract expressionists for producing emotional paintings, it may suggest that Lichtenstein was not rebelling against abstract expressionism or that he did not believe in the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion, it may suggest that Lichtenstein did not believe in using popular genres and comic book styles to convey true feeling.
  Therefore, options A, B, and C may challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Option D may not directly challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Option E may also not directly challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein but may suggest that Lichtenstein believed in the importance of emotion in painting.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Roy Lichtenstein helped define pop art by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. 
  Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques.

  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and as possessing an impulse toward realism.
  The author also characterizes Lichtenstein's work as having a kind of deliberate naivete and inner sweetness.
  If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, this would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein or his work.
  If Lichtenstein praised either a contemporary or early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, this would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein or his work.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum
  C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues against insider-trading law and suggests that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible. It argues that someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. 
  Passage B argues for transparency in the stock market and against insider-trading. It suggests that insider-trading unfairly compromises the market, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. 
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible and that someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. 
  Option A prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which might contradict the argument in Passage A. 
  Option B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage A. 
  Option C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which might contradict the argument in passage A. 
  Option D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which might contradict the argument in passage A. 
  Option E legalizes trading based on inside information, which might contradict the argument in passage B. 
  Therefore, the most appropriate answer that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws can impede the functioning of the stock market, and that the market operates best when all relevant information is quickly and widely disseminated. The author suggests that "insider nontrading" is a common practice that provides a useful counterpoint to insider trading.
  Passage B argues that transparency is a fundamental principle of the stock market, and that insider trading undermines the market's fairness and integrity. The author suggests that a loss of investor confidence resulting from insider trading can have serious negative consequences.
Thought:
  The author of Passage A suggests that insider-trading laws can be overly restrictive and prevent the efficient functioning of the stock market. Instead, the author proposes that the market operates best when all relevant information is widely disseminated. 
  Of the answer choices, (B) is most consistent with this view, as it permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws may hurt the stock market by preventing accurate information from spreading quickly.
  It suggests that insider nontrading is more common and not punished, but that it still creates an insider advantage.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the transparency of the stock market.
  It suggests that this harms investor confidence and could ultimately harm the market and companies seeking to grow.
Thought: 
  Passage A seems to argue that using private information to trade on a stock is not always objectionable, as long as it is generally available.
  It suggests that insider nontrading is not punished, but still creates an unfair advantage.
  Passage B seems to argue that insider trading is bad for the stock market because it undermines transparency and investor confidence. 
  It suggests that good investing decisions should be based on skill in analyzing public information, rather than on private information.
  A law that permits trading based on analysis of a stock and prohibits trading based on private information would conform to Passage A's position but not Passage B's.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism: 
  It's possible that neither author would fully agree with any of the laws presented.
  Both passages seem to suggest that transparency and fairness are important to the stock market, but they disagree on whether insider trading helps or harms those values.
  Passage A suggests that insider trading can be beneficial by spreading information quickly, while Passage B suggests that insider trading undermines transparency and fairness.
  Therefore, it's possible that both authors would reject any law that permits insider trading, even if it is based on analysis of the stock, or any law that legalizes trading based on inside information, even if it is generally available.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should permit trading based on information that everyone else does not have.
  The passage suggests that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely and as quickly as possible.
  Passage B argues that insider trading destroys transparency and unfairly compromises the market.
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that trading based on information that everyone else does not have would contribute to the efficient functioning of the stock market.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines transparency and compromises the market.
  Choice B would permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is consistent with the position articulated in Passage A.
  Choice A would prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which is inconsistent with the position articulated in Passage A.
  Choice C would prohibit trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which is not the main point of Passage A.
  Choice D would permit selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibit buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is not consistent with the position articulated in Passage A.
  Choice E would legalize trading based on inside information, which is not consistent with the position articulated in Passage A.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Criticism:
  None. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws are not helpful for a functioning stock market because stock prices represent everyone's information about a company's value and it is useful for the market when accurate information about a company is spread widely and quickly. 
  Passage A also distinguishes between insider-trading and "insider nontrading" and argues that the latter is a widespread practice that should not be criminalized.
  Passage B argues that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market and that insider-trading unfairly compromises the market by allowing some people to make informed trade decisions far before everyone else.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues against insider-trading laws and distinguishes between insider-trading and "insider nontrading". 
  Option A proposes a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which aligns with the argument made in Passage A. 
  Option B proposes a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is not the same as the argument made in Passage A.
  Option C proposes a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which does not conform to the position articulated by the author of Passage A.
  Option D proposes a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is not the same as the argument made in Passage A.
  Option E proposes a law that legalizes trading based on inside information as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means, which does not conform to the position articulated by the author of Passage A.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
Criticism: 
  None.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should permit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, as long as that information is obtained legally and helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines a transparent market and investor confidence, and could ultimately destroy the market. Therefore, it is illegal to trade based on inside information.
Thought:
  The author of Passage A argues that insider trading laws should permit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, as long as that information is obtained legally and helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That means the law should allow trading based on analysis of a stock. 
  The author of Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the market, and it should be illegal to trade based on inside information.
  Therefore, the law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law can sometimes undermine a transparent and efficient market, and that stock markets work best when all the relevant information is spread as widely and quickly as possible.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading situations unfairly compromise the market and cause a loss of investor confidence, which could ultimately destroy the market.
Thought:
  Passage A advocates for a more permissive approach to insider trading, while Passage B argues that insider-trading undermines the market and destroys investor confidence.
  Choice A, which would prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, is more in line with Passage B's argument against insider trading.
  Choice B, which would permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, is close to Passage A's position.
  Choice C, which would prohibit trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, could be seen as a compromise between the two passages.
  Choice D would permit selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is not explicitly argued for in either passage.
  Choice E, which legalizes trading based on inside information as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means, is more in line with Passage A's argument for a permissive approach to insider trading.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
Criticism:
  It is possible to interpret Passage A's argument as advocating for a nuanced approach to insider trading, rather than a completely permissive one. This could involve allowing certain types of insider trading while prohibiting others.
  Passage B's argument against insider trading is based on the idea that it unfairly compromises the market, but some may argue that this argument assumes that a completely transparent market is always desirable or achievable.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading is not always wrong and is sometimes necessary for the stock market to work efficiently.
  Passage B argues that insider trading is always wrong as it undermines the transparency of the market and investor confidence.
Thought: 
  The author of passage A believes that insider trading is not necessarily wrong and that it can be beneficial to the stock market. Therefore, the law that conforms most closely to the author's position would be a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock, but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This law allows people to use their skills and knowledge of the market to make informed decisions, while still maintaining the transparency of the market by prohibiting the use of non-public information to make trades. 
  A law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone (choice A) would be too restrictive and would prevent analysts from making informed decisions based on their research. 
  A law that legalizes trading based on inside information (choice E) would contradict the author's argument that insider trading is not always wrong and would undermine investor confidence in the market. 
  A law that legalizes selling based on inside information that the stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising (choice D) is arbitrary and does not fully capture the author's position. 
  A law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market (choice C) is too broad and does not distinguish between insider trading and other activities that could undermine investor confidence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The author of passage A argues that insider-trading law can be detrimental to the stock market.
  The author of passage A believes that the stock market works best when all relevant information is spread as widely and as quickly as possible.
  The author of passage A believes that someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping.
  The author of passage A argues that insider nontrading is a far more widespread practice and is not punished.
  The author of passage B argues that the basic principle of the stock market is transparency.
  The author of passage B argues that information that influences trading decisions should be available to all participants at the same time.
  The author of passage B argues that insider-trading unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence, which could ultimately destroy the market.
Thought:
  The author of passage A argues that insider-trading law can be detrimental to the stock market.
  The author of passage A believes that the stock market works best when all relevant information is spread as widely and as quickly as possible.
  The author of passage A believes that someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping.
  Therefore, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A would be a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This allows for individuals to make informed trading decisions based on their analysis of publicly available information, while preventing the unfair advantage obtained by those who have access to inside information.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible and insider nontrading is not punished.
  Passage A also argues that insider trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that is available to everyone.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the transparency of the stock market and compromises those who do not have access to inside information.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market.
Thought:
  Passage A supports the idea that all relevant information should be spread as widely as possible and insider nontrading is not punished.
  Passage A also argues that trading based on information that is available to everyone is not insider trading.
  Therefore, the law that conforms most closely to the position in passage A but not passage B would be one that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two theories of how communication between neurons happens in the brain.
  The first theory is that communication happens through electrical impulses, while the second theory is that it happens through chemical neurotransmitters.
  The passage discusses how the second theory has gained acceptance and how receptor molecules play a role in this process.
  The passage concludes by discussing the medical significance of this new understanding of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is to discuss how new evidence has led to a greater understanding of how communication between neurons happens in the brain and how this understanding has medical potential.
  Choice A is partially correct but not as complete or accurate as choice D, as it leaves out the discussion of the classification of these chemicals as a family and focuses only on the selective treatment of brain disorders.
  Choice B is also partially correct but not as complete or accurate as choice D, as it leaves out the discussion of subtle differences among receptor molecules and focuses only on the classification of these chemicals as a family.
  Choice C is incorrect because it only discusses the second theory without discussing the role of receptor molecules or the medical potential of this understanding.
  Choice D accurately summarizes the main point of the passage by stating that new evidence shows that communication between neurons happens through chemical neurotransmitters and how receptor molecules play a role in this process, and how these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the development of a theory about how the brain works and the evidence that has been gathered to support it. 
  The theory is that neurotransmitters, rather than electrical signals, transmit information between neurons through the binding of a chemical to a receptor, which opens an ion channel and creates an electrical impulse.
  This theory has been supported by the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, which are a family of receptors for different neurotransmitters.
  This discovery may lead to the development of drugs that selectively affect specific parts of the brain to treat brain disorders.
Thought:
  The main point of the passage is that the workings of the brain are guided by neurotransmitters, which transmit information between neurons through the binding of a chemical to a receptor, and that the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels may lead to the development of drugs that selectively affect specific parts of the brain to treat brain disorders.

  The alternative theory suggests that neurotransmitters secrete a chemical that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron, rendering the neuron permeable to ions, and generating an electrical impulse that runs through the cell and is transmitted to the receiving neuron.
  Recent research has provided evidence that receptors for neurotransmitters contain a neurotransmitter binding site and a channel for ions. The binding of the neurotransmitter to the receptor causes a change in shape, which opens the channel component.
  Several types of receptors for neurotransmitters have been identified that together constitute a family of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
  The identification and understanding of these receptors may lead to more targeted drug treatments for various brain disorders.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the history of theories about communication between neurons, and how recent research has provided evidence that chemical signals transmitted between neurons are mediated by receptors containing both a neurotransmitter binding site and an ion channel.
  The receptors for neurotransmitters constitute a family of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, which have similar structures but also some differences that may allow for selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that recent research has shown that chemical signals rather than electrical signals mediate communication between neurons, and that the receptors for these signals may offer opportunities for targeted drug treatments for specific brain disorders.
  Choice A is similar but doesn't include the part about the receptors being part of a family, which is important to the main point of the passage.
  Choice B is incorrect because it doesn't emphasize the selective treatment of brain disorders.
  Choice C is incorrect because it doesn't mention that the receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a channel for ions.
  Choice E is similar to choice A but doesn't convey that chemical signals mediate communication between neurons and that the receptors for these signals are part of a family.
Evaluation:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.

Response 0:
Knowledge:
- An organism is considered to have an infection when a pathogen establishes a viable presence in the organism and reproduces within the host organism.
- Pathogens reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA).
- Scientists have identified a pathogen causing CJD, a degenerative form of dementia in humans, which is called a prion and consists mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
- Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues.
- Prions have the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape, and prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way.
Thought:
- Abnormally shaped prions are the pathogenic agents responsible for CJD.
- The prions are composed mainly, if not exclusively, of protein, and lack nucleic acid.
- Prions have the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape, and prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way.
- Therefore, abnormally shaped prions are able to cause CJD because they can reproduce themselves.
- This supports choice C, that if the abnormally shaped prions were unable to reproduce themselves, they would not cause CJD.
Criticism:
- None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism and the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism.
  - Until recently, it was widely assumed that all pathogens contain genetic material in their cellular structure.
  - Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a degenerative form of dementia in humans caused by a protein pathogen called a prion.
  - Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues but they have the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape and reproducing themselves.
  - Prions exhibit infectious properties and reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
Thought: 
  - The passage mentions that prions reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. Therefore, the reproduction of abnormally shaped prions is necessary to cause CJD.
  - The passage does not suggest that most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  - The passage does not mention that Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  - The passage does not provide any information about the transmission of CJD through injection of abnormally shaped prions.
  - The passage states that there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses but it does not suggest that prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans caused by a protein pathogen called a prion.
  Prions normally occur in the body as proteins but are able to convert their structures into an abnormal shape that is infectious and capable of reproducing itself in an unexpected way.
  Prions reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
Thought:
  The passage describes the nature of prions and how they cause CJD.
  It states that prions are able to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way through a chain reaction.
  Therefore, if abnormally shaped prions were unable to reproduce themselves, they would not cause CJD.
  The other answer choices are not supported by the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of prions as a new type of protein pathogen that can cause diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). 
  The passage describes prions as being able to reproduce themselves by converting normally shaped prions into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
Thought: 
  The passage states that prions are able to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. 
  The passage also states that prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, and that the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  The passage does not support the idea that the only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual or that most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions. 
  The passage does not support the idea that Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  The passage does not provide information on whether prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to support the idea that prions would not cause CJD if they were unable to reproduce themselves. The passage describes prions as being able to reproduce themselves by converting normally shaped prions into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation, but it does not provide evidence that this is a necessary condition for prions to cause CJD. Alternatively, it is possible that there are other mechanisms by which prions cause cellular destruction that do not involve reproduction. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The passage discusses the discovery of prions as a new type of pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  - Prions are proteins that can convert into a pathogenic conformation, leading to the formation of plaques and the destruction of nerve cells in the brain.
  - Prions exist naturally in the body as harmless proteins but can transform into a dangerous form.
Thoughts:
  - The passage provides evidence that prions cause CJD and that they are an entirely new type of infectious pathogen.
  - It also indicates that prions can transform into a pathogenic conformation and that this transformation leads to the progression of CJD.
  - The passage does not support the idea that prions are responsible for most infectious diseases or that they are transmitted only through injection.
  - The passage does not mention a link between prions and Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease.
  - The passage does not provide information about the aggression of prion diseases compared to diseases caused by other pathogens.
Evaluation:
  - The passage suggests that prions cause CJD and are a new type of infectious pathogen.
  - It supports the idea that prions cause disease by transforming into a pathogenic conformation and reproducing themselves.
  - None of the other answer choices are supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called prions that can cause diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). 
  Prions are infectious agents lacking nucleic acid and composed mainly or exclusively of protein that can convert normal proteins into abnormal ones.
  Upon contact, normal proteins can transform into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation, initiating a chain reaction that produces plaques of thread-like structures in the brain that destroy nerve cells.
Thought: 
  The passage provides information about prions and how they cause CJD. 
  Prions are infectious agents that lack nucleic acid and consist of protein.
  If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  Prions can cause a chain reaction that produces plaques of thread-like structures in the brain and destroy nerve cells.
  It is suggested that prions may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to support statement A that the only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  The passage does not support statement B that most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  The passage does not support statement D that Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen.
  The passage does not provide information to support statement E that prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  CJD is a degenerative form of dementia in humans that causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge.
  Symptoms of CJD include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia.
  The pathogen responsible for CJD is a protein pathogen called prions.
  Abnormally shaped prions reproduce themselves in an unexpected way by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.
  Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation have infectious properties.
  Because prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
Thought: 
  The passage provides the most support for the idea that abnormally shaped prions must be able to reproduce themselves in order to cause CJD.
  This is because the passage notes that prions reproduce themselves on contact with normally shaped prions and that the cascade of transformations that this initiates ultimately destroys nerve cells.
  The passage does not provide any support for the idea that CJD can only be transmitted through injection, that most infectious diseases are caused by prions, that Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by the same prion pathogen as CJD, or that prion diseases progress more aggressively than those caused by other pathogens.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct.
  The passage clearly states that a chain reaction of prion transformations is what ultimately causes CJD, so it follows that prions must be able to reproduce themselves to have any effect.
  Additionally, the passage does not provide any support for any of the other answer choices.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:

- Prions reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact into the abnormal pathogenic conformation.
Thought:
- The passage discusses how prions cause CJD and reproduce themselves.
- The passage does not mention anything about transmission of CJD through injection or about prions causing most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens.
- The passage does support the idea that abnormally shaped prions cause CJD because they are able to reproduce themselves.
- The passage mentions the possibility of prions being involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, but it does not state that these diseases are caused by the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
- The passage does not provide enough information to determine whether prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand concepts in economic theory and how this contradiction has been addressed by economists over time.
  A: The passage does mention that increasing returns to scale led to a tendency toward monopoly, but it does not state that mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The passage does discuss how the idea of diminishing returns lends itself well to mathematical representation, but it does not state that the functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because of this reason. 
  C: The passage does mention that recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously, but this is not the main point of the passage.
  D: The passage mentions Adam Smith and his recognition of how self-interest can serve the common good, but this is not the main point of the passage. 
  E: The passage discusses how economists failed to account for increasing returns to scale for almost two centuries, and how recent developments in economic thought have allowed for the Pin Factory concept to be better understood.
Thought:

It describes how the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, but that recent developments in economic thought have allowed for the Pin Factory to be better understood. 
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have addressed the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand concepts, and that recent developments in economic thought have allowed for the Pin Factory to be better understood.
  The best answer is E.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand emphasizes the harnessing of self-interest to the common good.
  There is a tension between these two concepts because increasing returns to scale tend to lead to monopoly power, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry.
  Many economists in the past have favored the assumption of diminishing returns to scale because it lends itself more readily to mathematical representation.
  Only recently have increasing returns to scale gained more acceptance in economic thought.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the tension between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory, and how they are opposed to each other.
  It explains that increasing returns to scale tend to lead to monopoly power, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry.
  Because of the emphasis on mathematical rigor in economics, many economists have favored the assumption of diminishing returns to scale over increasing returns, even though the latter better reflects reality.
  Only recently have economists found ways to rigorously describe increasing returns to scale, and incorporate them into economic theory.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have historically struggled to reconcile the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, and that only in recent times have they been able to better incorporate the former into economic theory.
  Answer("E")
Criticism:
  While it is true that the passage discusses the tension between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, and how increasing returns to scale have historically been ignored in economic theory, the passage does not state that economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing.
  Answer choice A is therefore incorrect.
  Additionally, the passage does not state that recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  Answer choice C is therefore incorrect.
  Answer choice D is not the main point of the passage, as it only briefly mentions Adam Smith's contribution to economic theory.
  Answer choice B captures some aspects of the main point, but does not fully capture the emphasis on increasing returns to scale as the key issue.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the contradiction inherent in economic theory between the Pin Factory (increasing returns to scale) and the Invisible Hand (diminishing returns to scale).
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of larger scale and increased specialization.
  The Invisible Hand emphasizes how self-interest can lead to the common good in a competitive marketplace.
Thought:
  The passage argues that the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand are opposed to each other.
  The Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry, while the Pin Factory leads to natural monopoly and fewer players.
  For a long time, economic theory assumed diminishing returns to scale, which supports the Invisible Hand.
  Only recently have economists found ways to describe the Pin Factory mathematically and account for increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economic theory has long ignored the potential benefits of increasing returns to scale, but recent developments have allowed economists to account for these benefits.
  Answer: E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the ideas of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory involves increasing returns to scale, which can lead to natural tendencies toward monopoly.
  The Invisible Hand relies on many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power and promote the common good.
  Economics has scientific aspirations and seeks mathematical rigor.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is that the Pin Factory, which involves increasing returns to scale, has historically been de-emphasized in economic theory due to the difficulty of representing it mathematically, but it has become more prominent in recent years as a result of new developments in economics. The Invisible Hand, while central to economic theory, relies on the assumption of diminishing returns to scale. Therefore, the passage is most accurately expressed by choice E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory exemplifies increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand demonstrates the harnessing of self-interest for the common good.
  The Pin Factory poses a challenge to the functioning of the Invisible Hand because increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power and stifle competition.
  The economics of diminishing returns lend themselves more easily to mathematical representation than those of increasing returns.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the contradictions between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, the two concepts in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory demonstrates increasing returns to scale.
  The Invisible Hand demonstrates harnessing self-interest for the common good.
  These two concepts are opposed to each other because increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power and stifle competition, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors to function properly.
  The passage explains that while diminishing returns lend themselves more easily to mathematical representation, economists have found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
  The main point of the passage is that recent developments have enabled economists to account for the increasing returns to scale in many industries, which was previously ignored due to the difficulty of mathematical representation.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Criticism:
  The passage does discuss the difficulty in accounting for the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor, but it's not the main point.
  The passage also discusses Adam Smith's contribution to economic theory, but it's not the main point.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a contradiction between two concepts in economic theory: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand relies on the assumption of diminishing returns to ensure a competitive market.
  For a market to function properly, there must be many competitors in each industry.
  The economics of diminishing returns are easier to represent mathematically, so they have dominated economic theory for centuries.
  Only recently have economists found ways to more rigorously describe the Pin Factory and account for increasing returns to scale.
Thought:

  The passage does discuss how increasing returns to scale have been historically neglected in economic theory, but it is not the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
The main point of the passage is that there is a contradiction between two concepts in economic theory - the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand - and that for a free market to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power, but this contradicts the idea of increasing returns to scale that characterizes many enterprises. The passage also explains why this contradiction remained unresolved for almost two centuries and how recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
The main point of the passage is that the assumption of diminishing returns in economic theory dominated for almost two centuries, and that this was due to the difficulty of representing increasing returns such as those found in the Pin Factory mathematically. The passage also notes that recent developments have enabled increasing returns to be modeled more rigorously and that this has led to their increased importance in economic thought. Therefore, the most accurate choice is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades
Response 0:
The main point of the passage is that earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, and provided a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants, which led to the acceleration of African American migration to the North even at a time when income differences were narrowing. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the North accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of the African American population from the Southern United States to the Northern industrial cities between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by several factors including increased labor demand in the North during World War I, a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and the efforts of Northern employers to recruit African American labor in the South.
  The difficulties and costs of migration include uncertainty concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination, the physical cost of moving, and the need to adapt to a new culture or language.
  Early migrants helped defray the financial costs of later migrants, and provided temporary housing, food, credit, and cultural and linguistic support.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: indicate why previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided
  B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events
  C: challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915
  D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain
  E: suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial cities of the North between 1915 and 1960. 
  The passage explains that the Great Migration was initiated by World War I, immigration cuts, and a boll weevil infestation that reduced labor demand in the South. 
  The passage argues that the Great Migration accelerated over time due to the development of momentum, as current migration reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration. 
  The passage explains that early migrants provided information and support to later migrants, which reduced the cost of adaptation.
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph is "Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings." 
  This sentence is a continuation of the authors' explanation of why the Great Migration continued and accelerated over time, despite the narrowing of North-South income differences. 
  The sentence provides evidence for the authors' claim that the difficulty and cost of migration were reduced over time by the development of momentum and the provision of information and support by previous migrants.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
  The answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to support answer choices A, B, C, or E.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

  The answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism, but give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Insects play a major role in the development of secondary substances because they favor scents that attract pollinating insects and develop defenses against plant-eating insects.
Thought:
  Primary and secondary substances are both important to plants, but they serve different functions.
  Primary substances are required for a plant's basic functions and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are diverse and give plants their distinct tastes and smells.
  The relationship between primary and secondary substances is analogous to the relationship between essential and non-essential car features.
  Essential car features, such as engines and transmissions, are required for a car's basic function.
  Non-essential car features, such as paint and taillights, are not required for a car to run, but give it its distinctive look and serve other functions.
  Answer choice B describes this relationship most closely.
Criticism: 
  The relationship between plants' primary and secondary substances is not precisely analogous to any of the answer choices and could be open to interpretation.
  One could argue that answer choice E, where word processing programs are necessary for computers to function as word processors, is a closer analogy because secondary substances are necessary for plants to function as plants, just as word processing programs are necessary for computers to function as word processors.
  However, the analogy in answer choice B is still a reasonable representation of the relationship.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning; secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances are a result of genetic mutations and have been conserved by natural selection.
  Insects play a major role in the development of secondary substances; some are biochemical defenses against insects, while others attract pollinating insects to blossoms.
Thought: 
  The relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances can be compared to the relationships between a car's essential mechanical components and its non-essential features such as paint and taillights.
  The mechanical components are required for the car to run and are similar to the primary substances in plants, while the non-essential features are similar to the secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between plants and their primary and secondary substances and automobiles and their mechanical components and non-essential features is not perfect.
  While the non-essential features of a car are not required for it to run, they do serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety.
  On the other hand, some secondary substances in plants do serve important functions such as attracting pollinating insects or serving as biochemical defenses against insects.
  However, the analogy is still the closest of the choices provided.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Insects play a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today.
Thought: 
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances, which give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, don't have a known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  The relationship between primary and secondary substances is analogous to the relationship between the necessary components of a system and the distinctive or nonessential components that give the system its unique qualities.
  Option B, which describes the necessary and distinctive components of a car, is the most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Therefore, option B is the answer.
Criticism: 
  The analogy presented in option B is a good one.
  However, the relation between mechanical components and distinctive components of a car is not the best analogy for the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants.
  A better analogy would be the relationship between the necessary and distinctive components of a food dish.
  In that case, the necessary components would be the ingredients that are required for the dish to exist, while the distinctive components would be spices and other optional ingredients that give the dish its unique flavor.
  Therefore, the answer can be B, but a better analogy would be the one presented above.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
Thought:
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Therefore, the relationship between plants and its primary and secondary substances is analogous to a relationship where there are essential components that are required for the proper functioning of a system (plants in this case), and other components that are not essential but provide additional features or characteristics to the system (secondary substances in this case).
  Option B describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism:
  There is no major flaw in the knowledge and thought process applied to this question. However, one could argue that Option A could also be a valid analogy, as both primary substances in plants and electricity in hospitals are essential for proper functioning, while secondary substances and generators serve as backups in case of temporary unavailability.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the views of sociohistorical critics, who analyze how art reflects the ideology of the political and social elite who commissioned or created it.
  Taruskin is mentioned as an example of a sociohistorical critic who believes that high art is produced by and for political and social elites.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that enduring high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way. 
  This is because Taruskin prefers to deal with art produced in a way that expressed and mirrored the ideals and way of life of the elite.
  The passage also notes that sometimes great art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings, and in such cases, the sociohistorical critic must claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to support the views in the other answer choices.
  A, B, and E are all about the most talented artists throughout history, which is not the main focus of the passage.
  D is partially true, but it is not a view that is specifically attributed to Taruskin in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the ways that art has been produced for and by political and social elites throughout history.
  Taruskin argues that "high art" is produced by and for political and social elites.
  The passage suggests that there are two different ways that art was produced by and for elites historically: commissioning a work for display, or creating a work that expresses an elite's ideals and way of life.
  The sociohistorical critic analyzes how such art embodies the ideology of the elite, and it must be assumed that the elite had a recognizable identity and consensus about the world to make this analysis work.
Thought: 
  Taruskin's position is that "high art" is produced by and for political and social elites.
  The passage discusses how art produced by and for elites can embody the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position commits him to the view that high art produced by and for elites embodies the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  The answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that high art produced by and for elites embodies the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  However, the question is asking for a specific view that Taruskin's position commits him to, and the answer choices do not accurately reflect this view.
  Answer choice A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  Answer choice B is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the most successful artists working today.
  Answer choice D is incorrect because the passage suggests that artists who created art for and by elites were not necessarily members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  Answer choice E is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Taruskin's position on the production of art by and for political and social elites.
  The passage mentions two ways in which art was historically produced by the elite: commissioning a work for display and creating a work that expressed their ideals.
  The passage suggests that the taste of the aristocracy and upper middle class has not always produced enduring art, and that sometimes talented artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment.
  The passage argues that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to analyze art produced the second way, and that this kind of analysis depends on the elite having a recognizable identity and consensus about the world.
Thought:
  Taruskin's position is discussed in the passage, but it is not clear that he holds any of the views presented in the choices.
  A is not supported by the passage, which does not make any claims about the talent of artists throughout history or their ability to embody the ideology of the elite.
  B is not supported by the passage, which does not make any claims about the success of contemporary artists or the extent to which their work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C is suggested by the passage, which argues that enduring high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite may actually support that ideology in hidden ways.
  D is not supported by the passage, which notes that talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment and that art that went against the grain of elite values was sometimes paid for unwillingly and with misgivings.
  E is not supported by the passage, which does not make any claims about the talent of artists throughout history or their ability to subvert the ideology of the elite.
  Of the choices presented, C is the best fit for the passage, but it is not a perfect match. The passage does not explicitly state that Taruskin holds this view, but it is consistent with his focus on analyzing art produced by the elite in terms of its ability to embody their ideology in subtle ways.
Criticism:
  The passage suggests that Taruskin and other sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze art produced by and for political and social elites in terms of how it embodies the ideology of the elite. However, the passage does not provide enough information to determine whether Taruskin holds the view presented in choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Taruskin is a sociohistorical critic and author of the Oxford History of Western Music.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the ways in which art has been produced by and for the political and social elites throughout history.
  The passage distinguishes two ways in which art was produced for the elites.
  One way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display.
  The other way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  The author is critical of the view that art produced for the elites necessarily embodies the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that high art reflects the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  The author is critical of this view because it assumes that art produced for the elites reflects the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
  However, it is possible that art produced for the elites may not reflect the ideology of the elite, or may even subvert it.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Criticism:
  It is true that the author is critical of Taruskin's view that art produced for the elites reflects the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
  However, the passage does not suggest that the author believes that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
  The passage acknowledges that some art produced for the elites may not reflect the ideology of the elite, or may even subvert it, but it does not make a general claim about the most talented artists throughout history.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how art historically was "produced by and for political and social elites" in two different ways.
  The first way was by having a famous artist create something for display, and the second way was by creating a work that expressed and mirrored the ideals and way of life of the elite.
  The passage notes that sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with art produced the second way because it enables them to analyze how such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
Thought: 
  Taruskin and other sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with art produced that mirrors the ideals and way of life of the elite.
  The passage suggests that this kind of art allows critics to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.
  The passage notes that some art that went against the grain of elite values endured and critics must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
  Therefore, the passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  The answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.

  The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  The sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze the second type of art, because it embodied the ideology of the elite.
  Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to a view that high art reflects the ideology of the elite, even if the elite disapprove of the work.
  This is evident from the passage's statement that "The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures" and that "a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings."
  The passage also suggests that Taruskin and other sociohistorical critics analyze art that embodies the ideology of the elite, but that they must be careful to eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of patrons for their own reasons.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not suggest that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied or subverted the ideology of the elite.

Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that if high art appears to undermine the ideology of the elite but endures, it actually supports that ideology in some way.
  This is because sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with art produced by the elite that expresses and mirrors their ideals and way of life.
  Therefore, Taruskin and others would argue that even if the art appears critical or subversive, it ultimately reinforces the elite's values and beliefs.
  The answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Criticism:
  It is important to note that the passage does not explicitly state that Taruskin believes that enduring high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
Choices:
  A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  D: Most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  E: Dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.

  It is possible that the peers mentioned in line 22 may have also agreed with option C, "Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision," given the challenges of studying dance as a cultural phenomenon described in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of a dance technique known as dance-isolation and her success in bringing traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into modern North American dance. 
  The passage also discusses Dunham's training in both anthropological research and choreography, and her approach to research which diverged from the prevailing methodology at the time. 
Thought: 
  The question asks what statement about the study of dance would the "peers" mentioned in line 22 most likely agree with. 
  According to the passage, social scientists had neglected dance as an area of social research, and most colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, subscribing to the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. 
  Therefore, the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would most likely agree with the statement that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  The answer is C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide enough evidence to support the claim that "peers" would most likely agree with the statement that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  While the passage does indicate that dance had been neglected as an area of social research and that Dunham's approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time, it does not necessarily follow that the "peers" would have believed that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of the dance-isolation technique and her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  Dunham conducted research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms with a special interest in their origins in African culture.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
Thought:
  The "peers" mentioned in line 22 are social scientists who were working at the time of Dunham's research in the 1930s.
  According to the passage, most social scientists at the time were gravitating toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry.
  The passage discusses Dunham's approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time, but does not suggest that the peers mentioned in line 22 would have agreed with her approach.
  Therefore, the correct answer is not A, C, D, or E.
  The passage does suggest that experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research at the time, so B is a possible answer.
Criticism:
  While the passage notes that experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research at the time, it does not provide evidence to support the claim that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  Additionally, the passage does not suggest that the peers mentioned in line 22 would have agreed with this statement.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique called dance-isolation to North American and European choreography, which she learned through her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology, which was neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as scientifically rigorous.
Thought: 
  According to the passage, social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as scientifically rigorous. 
  The passage suggests that peers of social scientists would have agreed that dance ethnology was not a scientifically rigorous area of research.
  The passage does not suggest that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it (A), or that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision (C), or that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology (D), or that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection (E).
  The passage also does not suggest that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them (B).
  Therefore, the answer is A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not suggest that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  Instead, it suggests that dance was neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as scientifically rigorous. 
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of a dance technique known as dance-isolation and her success in bringing traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance.
  The passage also discusses Dunham's background as an anthropologist and her approach to research, which involved participating in the dances she was observing and learning the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology.
  Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists were not trained in dance techniques.
  Dunham's approach to research, which involved participating in the dances she was observing, allowed her to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices and learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
  The passage implies that this approach was divergent from the methodology that prevailed at the time, which emphasized complete detachment from the subject of study.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with statement B, which suggests that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of dance-isolation as a technique in modern North American dance.
  Dunham was an anthropologist who conducted research into traditional Caribbean dance forms.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Dunham's approach to research, which involved participating in the dances herself, was at odds with the prevailing view that effective data gathering must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  The "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with this view.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism: 
  While the passage does suggest that the prevailing view at the time was that effective data gathering must be conducted from a position of complete detachment, it does not provide evidence that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have agreed with statement B.
  In fact, the passage implies the opposite, as Dunham's success in bringing traditional dance techniques into the mainstream of modern North American dance was due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  Therefore, the answer is not B.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the history of dance ethnology and Katherine Dunham's contributions to the field.
  The passage notes that dance had been neglected as an area of social research and that most social scientists at that time were not trained in dance.
  The passage explains that Dunham's success in bringing traditional techniques from various cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance was due in part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
Thought:
  The peers mentioned in line 22 are likely other social scientists who would have held a view similar to the prevailing methodology at the time.
  The passage suggests that this prevailing methodology held that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in line 22 would most likely agree with choice B, which suggests that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.

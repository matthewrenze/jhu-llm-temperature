### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains how people's income and relative prosperity affect their happiness.
  Passage B explores the reasons why earning more makes people happier.
  Neither passage explicitly uses any of the terms in the answer choices to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
Thought: 
  Both passages suggest that people's desire to create value and feel successful is a driving force behind their pursuit of material wealth. 
  This motive can be viewed as both self-interested and pro-social, depending on one's perspective.
  It is possible that the authors of the passages would not use any of the provided terms to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors, as none of the terms fully captures the complexity of human motivation.
  However, if forced to choose, "egocentric" might be the closest fit since it suggests a self-centered orientation towards personal gain.
  None of the other terms seem particularly relevant or appropriate.
Criticism: 
  The passages do not provide any direct support for the idea that a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors is egocentric.
  The motives underlying this desire are likely to be multifaceted and may include both self-interested and pro-social elements.
  Describing someone as egocentric based on their desire for higher income may be an oversimplification of their character.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A and passage B discuss the relationship between wealth, success, and happiness.
  They both suggest that relative prosperity plays a role in people's happiness.
  The passages argue that people want to create value, and that earning more money is seen as evidence of success in this regard.
Thought:
  The passages suggest that people who want to make more money than their neighbors are not necessarily egocentric or misguided.
  Rather, this desire could be evidence of a desire to create value and be successful.
  Therefore, neither B (altruistic, egocentric) nor D (misguided, admirable) is a good choice.
  A (insular, cosmopolitan), C (happy, miserable), and E (lucky, primitive) do not seem to fit with the content of the passages.
  None of these pairs of terms would be likely to be used by the authors to describe someone who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  There is not enough information in the passages to suggest that the person is either insular or cosmopolitan, happy or miserable, lucky or primitive.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  The authors suggest that we compare our income with some norm that is rising as income rises, and that people feel happier when they feel successful and have created value.
  In Passage A, the authors describe the phenomenon of rivalry and how people are happy to be poorer as long as their relative position improves.
  In Passage B, the authors argue that wanting to create value benefits society and is evidence of a desire to create value.
Thought: 
  The authors do not use the terms "insular," "cosmopolitan," "altruistic," "egocentric," "happy," "miserable," "misguided," "admirable," "lucky," or "primitive" to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  However, based on the information presented, the authors of Passage A might describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors as being motivated by "rivalry."
  The authors of Passage B might describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors as being motivated by a desire to "create value."
  Neither passage suggests that wanting to make more than one's neighbors is inherently good or bad.
  Therefore, neither passage would use terms like "misguided" or "admirable" to describe this behavior.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss research and theories about the relationship between wealth and happiness. 
  The Solnick and Hemenway study found that people generally prefer to earn less money if it means they can have a higher relative position to their reference group. 
  Passage B argues that people feel happier when they earn more money because they feel successful and have created value, rather than simply because they have more money than others.
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B do not necessarily label the desire to make more money than one's neighbors as a negative or positive trait. 
  Rather, they attempt to explain why people have this desire (i.e. to feel successful and create value). 
  Therefore, neither "misguided" nor "admirable" seem like appropriate terms to describe this desire. 
  Furthermore, "egocentric" seems too negative and "altruistic" seems too positive. 
  The terms "insular," "cosmopolitan," "happy," "miserable," "lucky," and "primitive" do not seem particularly relevant to this question. 
  Therefore, none of the choices seem appropriate to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The first passage discusses how people compare their income with a norm, which pushes up the norm.
  The second passage argues that people want to earn more money to feel successful and create value.
Thought: 
  The authors do not condemn the desire to make more money than one's neighbors, but rather explain the reasons behind it. 
  Neither passage suggests that a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is egocentric or primitive.
  Passage A describes how people want to improve their relative position and be happier than those who make less money.
  Passage B argues that people want to feel successful and create value.
  Therefore, neither A nor B are the correct answer.
  Answer("None of the above").
Criticism: N/A.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the relationship between wealth and happiness and how people compare their wealth to others for a sense of well-being.
  Passage B argues that people value the creation of value more than wealth itself.
Thought: 
  The authors of the passages do not seem to have a negative or positive opinion on the desire to make more money than one's neighbors.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that the authors would use terms such as "misguided" or "admirable".
  Passage B suggests that a desire to make more money than one's neighbors is evidence of a desire to create value, and that this benefits society.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that the authors would use terms such as "primitive".
  The authors of the passages do not suggest that a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is either "insular" or "cosmopolitan".
  Passage B suggests that a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors may be focused on creating value, whereas Passage A may suggest that this desire is driven by a sense of relative prosperity.
  Therefore, the authors of the two passages may use different terminology to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passages discuss research concerning the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  Passage A discusses the role of habituation and rivalry in shaping our perception of the wealth necessary for happiness.
  Passage B challenges the idea that wanting to earn more than others is driven by a primitive urge for one-upmanship, instead positing that this desire stems from a desire to create value.
Thought: 
  Passage A examines the phenomenon that people tend to compare themselves to others and seek to improve their relative position, at times even if it means earning less money overall.
  Passage B argues that the desire to create value, not merely to have more than others, underlies the human desire for wealth.
  Neither passage explicitly characterizes those who desire to earn more than their neighbors with a specific term.
  However, if we had to choose from the given options, "egocentric" seems to come closest to capturing the desire to improve one's relative position by earning more money.
  "Egocentric" suggests that the individual is primarily concerned with their own interests and lacks concern for the welfare of others.
Criticism: 
  It is possible to imagine a person who desires to earn more than their neighbors because they wish to support their family or contribute to their community, rather than purely out of self-interest.
  The term "egocentric" could therefore be too narrow to describe all individuals who seek to earn more than their peers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the paradox of how richer people tend to report higher levels of happiness than poorer people, but advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. People compare their income with some norm, and the norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. It is crucial for people's happiness about how they compare to their "reference group" those most like them. People in East Germany have become unhappy because they compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries.
  Passage B does not support the theory that the urge to have more material wealth comes from our past as a way to demonstrate superiority, but rather from people's desire to create value and feel successful. People who earn more view themselves as successful, but it is the success and not the money per se that provides the happiness. 
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B talk about the relationship between income and happiness. Passage A discusses how people compare themselves with others who are in their reference group, and this comparison is crucial for their happiness. Wanting to have more material wealth is an ignoble tendency. Passage B suggests that people who earn more view themselves as successful. It is the success -not the money per se- that provides the happiness.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A would describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "rivalrous," and the authors of Passage B would describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "wanting to create value."
  The answer is None of the Above.
Criticism: 
  The authors of Passage A do describe people's tendency to compare their income with others and how this affects their happiness. They also describe the phenomenon of rivalry, where people are happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. However, Passage A does not provide specific terminology for people who want to make more money than their neighbors.
  The authors of Passage B suggest that people who earn more view themselves as successful and that it is the success -not the money per se- that provides the happiness. Although Passage B does not use the term "wanting to create value" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors, it does suggest that people use material wealth to show that they are prosperous because they create value.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D: misguided, admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and B talk about the connection between wealth and happiness, and how people compare their income with some norm and with their "reference group".
  Passage A mentions the phenomenon of rivalry, in which people are happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved.
  Passage B suggests that people use material wealth to show not just that they are prosperous, but that they are prosperous because they create value. Wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness.
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that people compare their income with some norm and with their "reference group". People may be happy if they are richer than their "reference group".
  Passage B suggests that people use material wealth to show that they are prosperous because they create value. Wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness.
  From the above information, it is not clear which pair of terms would most likely be used by the authors of Passage A and Passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  None of the choices seem to fit the authors' description.
Criticism:
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B do not provide a specific pair of terms to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the research about happiness and wealth, habituation, rivalry, and how people compare their income with some norm.
  Passage B discusses the theory that people who earn more feel successful and have created value and that wanting to create value benefits society.
Thought: 
  Passage B discusses how wanting to make more money than neighbors is not a negative thing since it is evidence of a desire to create value.
  Passage A shows that how people compare their income with some norm is crucial to happiness, so it is not possible to determine if wanting to make more money than neighbors is good or bad since it depends on how people compare themselves.
  Neither passage uses the terms "insular," "cosmopolitan," "altruistic," "egocentric," "misguided," "admirable," "lucky," or "primitive" to describe people who want to make more money than their neighbors.
  Therefore, we cannot answer the question as presented.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: The information in the passage most helps to answer a which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: What laboratory experiments were conducted by Molina or Rowland in their research on CFCs?
  B: What was the estimated concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere in 1 987?

  C: The passage mentions that Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress, but it does not provide information on the specific year he testified.
  D: The passage mentions that the breakdown of CFCs in the stratosphere results in an increase in the concentration of chlorine, which reacts with and destroys ozone molecules, but it does not provide information on other chemicals that contribute to the destruction of ozone molecules.
  E: The passage mentions that the breakdown of CFCs in the stratosphere increases the concentration of chlorine, which reacts with and destroys ozone molecules, but it does not provide information on which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone.
Thought:
  The passage provides information on the research and advocacy of Molina and Rowland on the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  None of the answer choices directly relates to this information.
  Therefore, the best answer would be an option that is a logical inference or implication of the information given.
  Option B provides information on the estimated concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere, but it is not clear why this information would be important or relevant.
  Option C provides information on the year Molina testified, but this information is not crucial to the main idea of the passage.
  Option D is mentioned in the passage, but it is not the focus of the discussion.
  Option E is not mentioned directly in the passage.
  Thus, none of the answer choices is entirely satisfactory.
  However, option B seems to be the most relevant and specific to the topic of the passage and could be inferred from the passage.
Criticism:
  The passage mainly focuses on the research and advocacy of Molina and Rowland on the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer, which is not directly relevant to any of the answer choices.
  While option B is somewhat related to the discussion, the passage does not provide a clear answer to this question.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
The passage provides information to answer the question in choice E: "Which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone?" Specifically, the passage explains how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer by breaking down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. Chlorine reacts with ozone in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms, and each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. Therefore, the constituent element of CFCs that is most damaging to ozone is chlorine. 

Action: Answer("E")

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.
Response 0:

  Choice A is supported by the passage in stating that some chemicals that do not have a direct role in the growth or metabolism of plants are important to certain kinds of plants.
  Choice B is not supported by the passage, which notes that plant-eating insects have had to evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses in order to survive.
  Choice C is not supported by the passage, which states that insects identify plants by their characteristic flavors or odors.
  Choice D is partially supported by the passage, which states that some secondary substances arose by mutation and were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. However, the passage does not indicate that the toxic substances evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but only in a few species.
  Choice E is not supported by the passage, which distinguishes between primary and secondary substances and does not discuss toxic substances that are not secondary substances.
Criticism: 
  Choice D is partially supported by the passage. It is not clear whether toxic substances evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants or only in a few species. However, the passage provides more information on the role of secondary substances in plant defense systems, which supports choice A more strongly.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, including primary and secondary substances.
  Primary substances are required for the growth and metabolism of plants, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances are diverse and give plants a biochemical defense against insects.
  Insects have played a major role in the evolution of secondary substances in plants.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the role of secondary substances in plants and their biochemical defense against insects.
  These secondary substances have evolved as a result of mutations and natural selection.
  The competition between plants and insects has led to the evolution of specialized feeding patterns among insects.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  The answer is A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and the role of secondary substances in their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances are diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Natural selection conserves defensive secondary substances and scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. 
  The competition between plants and plant-eating insects has caused the evolution of insects that can circumvent defense mechanisms.
Thought: 
  The passage focuses on the roles of primary and secondary substances in plants.
  Secondary substances are not known to be directly involved in plant growth or metabolism but play a vital role in plant survival by attracting pollinators and defending against plant-eating insects.
  Natural selection conserves secondary substances that function as defensive mechanisms against insects that eat plants.
  Insects that feed on plants develop ways to circumvent plant defense mechanisms and can identify suitable plants by their characteristic tastes and smells.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
Criticism: 
  Another answer choice that could be supported by the passage is B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  However, this answer choice is not as strongly supported as A by the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and their secondary substances, which are responsible for the distinctive tastes and smells of plants.
  Secondary substances can arise by mutation and are conserved by natural selection because they are advantageous to the plant by either attracting pollinating insects or defending against plant-eating insects.
  Evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects has led to the diversification of chemical defense systems in plants.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the importance of secondary substances in plants, which have evolved to defend against insects and attract pollinators.
  Secondary substances are not involved in the growth or metabolism of plants.
  Natural selection has favored the development of secondary substances in plants that provide an advantage in the competition with insects.
  Therefore, the most supported inference is that some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about how the chemical composition of plants is responsible for their taste and smell.
  Plants contain primary and secondary substances.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are chemicals with no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms.
  Some secondary substances are biochemical defenses against insects.
  Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both.
Thought:
  Option A is consistent with the information about the role of secondary substances in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  Option B is not supported because the passage mentions that as the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect.
  Option C is not supported because the passage suggests that insects are able to identify their food sources through their characteristic flavors and odors.
  Option D is not supported because the passage suggests that some secondary substances arose by mutation and are conserved by natural selection.
  Option E is not supported because the passage suggests that toxic substances are an aspect of the chemical defenses that plants have evolved, but not all toxic substances are secondary substances.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, and how secondary substances give plants their distinctive smells and tastes.
  The secondary substances in plants include those that attract pollinating insects and those that defend against plant-eating insects.
  Insects have played a major role in the evolution of many plants' secondary substances.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that secondary substances that have evolved by genetic mutation survive and are passed on to subsequent generations if they pass the muster of natural selection.
  Secondary substances that are favored by natural selection are those that are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms, those that are biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects, and those that dissuade insects from feeding by warning them of the presence of harmful substances.
  The competition between plants and insects has resulted in the evolution of narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants that serve as suitable food sources for any one species of insect.
  It is likely that some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
Criticism: 
  The passage actually suggests that plants have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species, and that most plants that have these systems are used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways to circumvent those defenses. This contradicts answer choice B.
  The passage also does not discuss whether most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell, so answer choice C is not supported.
  Answer choice D is partially supported by the passage, but it is not clear whether many secondary substances that are toxic to insects have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but have survived in only a few species.
  Answer choice E is not supported by the passage, as all of the secondary substances discussed are in fact secondary substances.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the chemical composition of plants and explains that the characteristic scents and tastes of plants come from secondary substances. 
  Secondary substances may have various roles in the lives of plants, such as attracting pollinating insects or defending against predators. 
  Insects and plants have been in an evolutionary competition for hundreds of millions of years, resulting in the evolution of various defense mechanisms and adaptations. 
Thought:
  Option A is supported by the passage since it states that secondary substances, which have no known role in plants' internal chemical processes, play a vital role in the lives of various kinds of plants. 
  Option B is not supported by the passage, as it explains that insects have had to evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses, and that fewer and fewer plants have remained suitable food sources for any one species of insect. 
  Option C is not supported by the passage, since it describes insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted plants, but there is no mention of how they identify these plants. 
  Option D is not supported by the passage, since it states that secondary substances arise as a result of genetic mutations but only a few of these secondary substances occur in any one species of plant. 
  Option E is not supported by the passage, since it does not mention any toxic substances that are not secondary substances. 
Criticism: 
  Options B, C, and D are not fully supported by the passage. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the chemical composition of plants, including primary and secondary substances.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and can serve as biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects.
  Insects play a role in the evolution of secondary substances in plants, as they can be attracted to certain scents and may develop ways to circumvent or tolerate plant defenses.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the role of secondary substances in plants and their interactions with insects.
  It suggests that secondary substances can serve as both attractants and defenses against insects and that insects can evolve ways to circumvent plant defenses.
  The passage does not provide any evidence for choice A, which suggests that unknown chemicals play "vital roles" in plants.
  Choice B is partially supported by the passage, which describes how some insects can circumvent plant defenses to use them as food sources. However, the passage does not provide evidence that "most" plants are still vulnerable to insect feeding despite their chemical defense systems.
  Choice C contradicts the passage, which states that insects identify plants with characteristic tastes and smells.
  Choice D is not directly supported by the passage, which does not discuss how toxic substances evolve independently in unrelated plants.
  Choice E is supported by the passage, which describes how some toxic substances evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide support for the majority of the answer choices.
  Some of the choices contradict or misinterpret the information provided in the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains the roles of primary and secondary substances in plants' chemical compositions.
  Secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plant growth or metabolism. 
  Secondary substances are responsible for giving plants distinctive tastes and smells.
  Insects play a major role in many plants having secondary substances due to natural selection.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that secondary substances in plants have roles in the lives of various kinds of plants. 
  The sentences that support this are "The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells." 
  Therefore, A seems to be the best inference.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that secondary substances in plants give them distinctive tastes and smells and these substances have evolved through genetic mutation and natural selection. 
  The passage also discusses how insects have played a major role in the evolution of secondary substances and chemical defense systems of plants.
A: The passage does provide support for this statement. It mentions that the secondary substances in plants have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants and are a diverse array of chemicals that play various roles in plants such as chemical defense systems and attracting pollinating insects.
B: The passage mentions that some chemical substances are defenses against the enemies of plants, and some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. It also says insects come to prefer plants whose defenses they can circumvent and thus, species of insects have tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants. However, the passage does not support that most plants are used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing defense systems.
C: The passage does not provide support for this statement. Instead, it explains that insects have evolved the ability to identify plants by their characteristic flavors or odors or both.
D: The passage mentions that secondary substances arose by mutation and were conserved by natural selection. Some of these substances are biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Therefore, the passage supports that many secondary substances that are toxic to insects have survived in only a few species, but it does not mention that such substances have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants.
E: The passage supports this statement. It mentions that some secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought to have evolved in correlation with other secondary substances, which gives the plants a characteristic taste or smell.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how secondary substances in plants have evolved through genetic mutation and natural selection and play different roles such as chemical defense systems that cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even die.
  The passage also says that some toxic substances have evolved along with secondary substances.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.
Criticism: 
  There does not seem to be any flaw in the facts, logic, or reasoning used to arrive at the answer.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the concept of increasing returns to scale and how it produces more output per worker when factors of production are increased, leading to economies of scale.
Thought: 
  A publishing house using fewer editors, a bee colony, a year-round school district, or the use of improved technology for lobster traps all suggest a way of producing greater output per worker or per unit of capital. However, none of them illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale, in which more factors of production lead to greater output per unit of capital. The example of an ant colony, on the other hand, directly illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale, as more colonies produce more output collectively than they would have individually.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Criticism: 
  You are right in identifying the options that suggest greater output per worker or per unit of capital, but many of the options suggest constant returns to scale, in which additional input leads to equal percentage increases in output. Furthermore, the example of an ant colony does not illustrate increasing returns to scale in the traditional sense, as in a factory or business. It illustrates how division and competition in a colony can lead to greater collective growth and productivity. The passage also clarifies that railroads illustrate increasing returns to scale, which are harder to represent mathematically than diminishing returns to scale, presenting a further challenge to identifying the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which refers to the idea that larger firms can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller firms. This allows them to drive smaller firms out of business and dominate the market. The parable of the pin factory is used to illustrate this concept.
Thought:
  Option A describes a decrease in the number of editors, which is a decrease in scale, and is therefore not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Option B describes a bee colony using some bees as guards to protect nectar sources, which is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Option C describes a school district using year-round operation to increase the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building, which is an example of increasing returns to scale. However, it does not involve businesses or competition among them, which is the focus of the passage.
  Option D describes the lobster industry catching more lobsters with the same number of traps, which is an example of increasing returns to scale. This allows them to increase their output and become more competitive in the market.
  Option E describes an ant colony dividing and producing more colonies, which is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The lobster industry is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains the concept of increasing returns to scale, which refers to the phenomenon that as a company grows larger, its average costs decrease, enabling it to produce goods at a lower cost than smaller competitors.
  A: This option describes a decrease in productivity, rather than an increase, so it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: This option describes an example of division of labor, but not necessarily of increasing returns to scale.
  C: This option describes an increase in the number of students that a school district can accommodate by changing its operations, so it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  D: This option describes an increase in efficiency due to the use of technology, so it could illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  E: This option describes an example of division of labor, but not necessarily of increasing returns to scale.
Thought: 
  The concept of increasing returns to scale refer to the phenomenon that as a company grows larger, its average costs decrease, enabling it to produce goods at a lower cost than smaller competitors.
  Option D describes an increase in efficiency due to the use of technology, which enables the lobster industry to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps.
  This increase in efficiency could translate into lower costs and higher profits, which are characteristic of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, option D could best illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which means that as a firm or industry increases in size, there is a corresponding increase in efficiency or productivity.
Thought: 
  A: This choice is incorrect because it describes a firm decreasing standards, which does not lead to increasing returns to scale.
  B: This choice does not describe an economic concept related to firms or industries, but rather a biological concept related to bee colonies. Therefore, it is incorrect.
  C: This choice describes a situation where the scale is increasing, but it is due to a change in operation rather than an increase in the size of the school district. Therefore, it is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  D: This choice is talking about how an entire industry is able to catch more lobsters, which could indicate increasing returns to scale for the lobster industry as a whole.
  E: This choice is also not related to economics concepts related to firms or industries and is instead talking about biological concepts related to ant colonies.
Criticism: 
  Choice A, B, C, and E do not accurately describe the economic concept of increasing returns to scale. 
  Choice D is not entirely clear if the industry is increasing in size or if the efficiency is increasing through technological advancements.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The passage describes a contradiction between two economic concepts: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
- The Pin Factory emphasizes the increasing returns to scale, which means that larger companies can produce more efficiently and effectively than smaller companies.
- Increasing returns to scale naturally lead to monopoly power and a lack of competition, which goes against the idea of the Invisible Hand.
Thought:
- The question asks for an example that best illustrates increasing returns to scale.
- Option A describes a situation where a publishing house employs fewer editors, which does not illustrate an increase in efficiency due to scale.
- Option B describes a bee colony that is able to collect more nectar and feed a larger colony due to specialized roles, which does illustrate increasing efficiency due to scale.
- Option C describes a school district employing a year-round operation to accommodate more students, which does not necessarily illustrate an increase in efficiency due to scale.
- Option D describes the lobster industry using technology to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps, which does illustrate increasing efficiency due to scale.
- Option E describes an ant colony dividing and producing more colonies, which does illustrate increasing efficiency due to scale.
- However, option B more directly describes the concept of increasing returns to scale in the context of specialized roles that enable higher productivity and efficiency.
- Therefore, the best answer is B: a large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
Criticism:
- Option E is also a valid example of increasing efficiency due to scale in the context of multiple colonies producing more ants than could exist in one colony.
- However, option B is more directly related to the concept of specialized roles and increasing productivity and efficiency.
- Both options B and E could potentially be correct answers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale refer to the idea that larger organizations can produce more efficiently than smaller ones.
  This is illustrated in the passage with the example of the pin factory; the more specialized the workers, the more pins the factory can produce per worker.
Thought:
  To identify the example that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale, we should look for an example that shows how a larger organization can produce more efficiently than a smaller one.
  A: This example refers to a reduction in productivity, so it cannot illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: This example refers to a larger bee colony being able to collect more nectar, which is a form of economies of scale and can illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  C: This example refers to an increase in capacity, but does not address the relative efficiency of larger and smaller organizations. Therefore, it is not a good example of increasing returns to scale.
  D: This example describes advances in technology contributing to greater efficiency, but does not address the relative efficiency of larger and smaller organizations. Therefore, it is not a good example of increasing returns to scale.
  E: This example describes how a larger organization can be more efficient than a smaller one in producing results, in this case, a greater number of ants. This is a good example of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the best answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which means that as a company gets larger, it becomes more efficient, and each worker produces more. 
  A: A publishing house employing fewer editors doesn't illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  B: A bee colony using some bees solely to guard nectar doesn't illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  C: A school district switching to year-round operations doesn't illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  D: This option might illustrate increasing returns to scale, as advances in technology make catching lobsters more efficient. Lobster industry as a whole could catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps.
  E: An ant colony dividing and producing two or more colonies is not related to increasing returns to scale. 
Thought: 
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale as a concept where a company becomes more efficient as it grows larger, thereby producing more per worker. The lobster industry example in option D fits the description of the concept. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale means that as the size of a business increases, the efficiency and output of individual workers also increase.
  The passage suggests that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopolies if they are not balanced with competition.
Thought: 
  A: Relaxing the standards for editors may increase the productivity of individual editors, but it does not necessarily increase the efficiency of the publishing house as a whole. Therefore, it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: The large bee colony is taking advantage of division of labor to increase efficiency and output. This illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  C: Year-round operation may help the school district accommodate more students, but it is not necessarily an example of increasing returns to scale because it doesn't directly address how the size of the district itself affects efficiency and output.
  D: The lobster industry example describes technological advances that increase efficiency, but it does not directly address how the size of the industry affects efficiency and output.
  E: The example describes the increase in efficiency and output that results from dividing a large ant colony into smaller ones. This illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the best answer is either B or E.
Criticism: 
  Both B and E are potentially valid answers because they both illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale. However, B describes a natural process within a bee colony, while E describes a deliberate action by an ant colony. It could be argued that B is a more straightforward example of increasing returns to scale than E, which involves a more complex social dynamic. Therefore, B is the best answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  The example of the pin factory shows how increasing returns to scale can lead to more specialized workers and more productivity.
  The passage also talks about how increasing returns to scale can lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly by larger players.
Thought: 
  Option A describes a decreasing return to scale-the editors are less productive by relaxing the standards. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Option B describes an example of division of labor in a bee colony, which is similar to the pin factory example, and could be an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Option C describes a change in scheduling and does not describe a change in output based on the size of the operation. Therefore, it is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Option D describes a technology change leading to a larger catch with the same number of traps, which is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Option E describes an increase in the number of colonies that are each successful, which is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Options B, D, and E therefore all describe examples of increasing returns to scale.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant criticism of this analysis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the concept of increasing returns to scale and its contradiction with the invisible hand.
  The Pin Factory example illustrates that increasing returns lead to natural tendency toward monopoly and decrease the number of competitors in an industry.
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale refer to a situation where the output of a production process increases at a greater rate than the increase in inputs.
  The Pin Factory example illustrates increasing returns to scale since the productivity of the factory workers increases as the factory size increases. 
  The lobster industry example refers to technological progress, which is a different concept than increasing returns to scale.
  The publishing house example shows decreasing returns to scale since the productivity of the editors decreases as the publisher reduces their standards.
  The bee colony example illustrates how division of labor increases efficiency, but it is not directly related to the concept of scaling.
  The school district example refers to better allocation of resources, but it is not directly related to the concept of scaling. 
  Thus, the best illustration of the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage is option E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Criticism: 
  The example with the ants is a good illustration of the increasing returns to scale concept since the colonies are able to produce more ants by dividing into smaller and more efficient subunits. However, it is arguably not the best illustration, since it is not related to human production processes, the main focus of the passage.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of symbols for writing in ancient Sumeria and how it evolved into the use of marks on clay tablets.
  The sign for "sheep" is not a pictograph but rather an abstract symbol.
Thought: 
  The author of the passage is most likely to agree that the sign for 'sheep' is an example of an abstract symbol used for writing in ancient Sumeria. 
  The sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross.
  The author does not make any claims regarding the potential replacement of this sign with another.
  The author does not make any direct comparisons between the signs for "sheep" and "metal".
  The author does not provide any evidence or reasoning to suggest that the way in which the sign for "sheep" represents its meaning resulted from sheep being an agricultural commodity.
  Denise Schmandt-Besserat is mentioned in the passage, but the author does not suggest that the sign for "sheep" had not been subject to scientific scrutiny prior to her work. 
  The author does not make any claims or suggestions regarding the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.
  The best answer is therefore A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses early writing systems found in the Sumerian city of Uruk.
  The writing on the clay tablets uses abstract symbols.
  The sign for "sheep" is represented by a circled cross, not an image of a sheep.
Thought: 
  The author does not give direct opinions about the sign for "sheep."
  The author explains that the writing system uses abstract symbols, rather than pictographs.
  Therefore, the sign for "sheep" is abstract, represented by a circled cross.
  The author does not suggest that this sign could have been replaced or that its meaning resulted from sheep being an agricultural commodity.
  The author does not discuss any scientific scrutiny of the sign prior to Schmandt-Besserat's work.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of clay tablets in Uruk that use abstract symbols rather than pictographs.
  The sign for "sheep" is described as a circled cross.
Thought: 
  The passage does not provide enough information to definitively choose an answer regarding the sign for "sheep."
  Answer choices A, B, C, D, and E all make claims about the sign that are not supported by the information given in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the origin and evolution of writing in ancient civilizations.
  The sign for "sheep" in Sumerian cuneiform is a circled cross.
Thought:
  The author does not provide a clear opinion on the sign for "sheep", but they do mention that it is an abstract symbol, not a pictograph.
  Choice A is not mentioned in the passage.
  Choice B is also not mentioned in the passage.
  Choice C is not discussed in the passage.
  Choice D is not directly discussed in the passage, but Schmandt-Besserat's work is mentioned as identifying the predecessors to the written word as clay tokens.

  Choice E is not discussed in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the symbols used in cuneiform writing on clay tablets found in Uruk, dating from around 3000 B.C.
  The sign for "sheep" is a circled cross, rather than an image of a sheep.
Thought:
  The author does not provide an explicit statement of their opinion on the issue.
  However, the author may agree with the statement that the way in which the sign for "sheep" represents its meaning is based on the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  This is because the passage notes that the tokens and symbols used in the clay tablets were used to record contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools.
  Furthermore, the abstract symbols used in the writing suggest a rise in industry and the evolution of written language from a system of three-dimensional nouns to marks on clay tablets, indicating a societal shift from a predominantly agricultural to an increasingly industrial and commercial economy.
  Therefore, it is possible that the author would agree with the statement in option C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the development of writing in ancient civilizations.
  The sign for "sheep" in cuneiform isn't a pictograph, but an abstract symbol.

  B: The author doesn't compare the sign for "sheep" to the sign for "metal" and how they get their meaning.
  C: The author doesn't discuss why the sign for "sheep" represents its meaning in a certain way.
  D: The author doesn't discuss whether the sign for "sheep" was the subject of scientific scrutiny prior to Schmandt-Besserat's work.
  E: The author doesn't suggest that the abstract nature of the sign for "sheep" reveals anything about the political life of the people who used the language.
Thought: 
  The author notes that the sign for "sheep" is not a pictograph but an abstract symbol.
  The author doesn't provide an explanation for why the symbol looks the way it does.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with choice D: The way in which it represents its meaning was not the subject of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the early development of written language in ancient cultures.
  The sign for "sheep" in cuneiform writing is not a pictograph, but an abstract symbol.
Thought: 
  The author of the passage is likely to agree that the sign for "sheep" in cuneiform writing is an abstract symbol.
  This is because the passage states that "the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used."
  Therefore, option B, which implies that the sign for "sheep" gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning, is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the presence of abstract symbols on early clay tablets from the Sumerian city of Uruk.
  The sign for "sheep" on these tablets is described as a circled cross rather than an image of a sheep.
Thought: 
  The author does not provide a clear statement about the sign for "sheep", but based on the information provided, it seems likely that the author would agree with statement B: "The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for 'metal' gets its meaning." This is because the passage notes that the signs were abstract and not pictographic, and that the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. This suggests that the sign for "sheep" is also abstract and not directly representational of the animal.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide enough information to definitively support any of the given statements about the sign for "sheep". It is possible that the author would agree with a statement different from the one chosen here.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the cuneiform writing system used on clay tablets found in the Sumerian city of Uruk.
  The tablets date back to roughly 3000 B.C. and use abstract symbols instead of pictographs.
  The sign for "sheep" is a circled cross, not an image of a sheep.
Thought: 
  The author of the passage discusses the sign for "sheep" in the context of the abstract nature of the symbols used in cuneiform writing.
  The author does not make any statements about the interchangeability of the sign for "sheep" with another symbol.
  The author also does not compare the way in which the sign for "sheep" gets its meaning with the way in which the sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  The author does not discuss the cultural or economic significance of sheep in relation to the abstract symbol for "sheep."
  The author briefly mentions Denise Schmandt-Besserat's research on the predecessor to cuneiform writing, but this is not directly related to the sign for "sheep."
  The author does not make any statements about the political life of the people who used cuneiform writing.
  Therefore, it is not possible to determine which statement regarding the sign for "sheep" the author would be most likely to agree with based on the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the writing system used in ancient Sumeria.
  The sign for "sheep" is a circled cross, not an image of a sheep.
Thought: 
  The passage does not explicitly state the author's opinion on the sign for "sheep," but we can infer that the author would agree more with option C than with any other choice. 
  The passage explains that the writing system was used to record contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools, therefore it is more likely that the sign represents a commodity rather than the animal itself.
  Option A is incorrect since the passage implies that the symbols were not interchangeable.
  Option B is not supported or refuted by the passage.
  Option D is incorrect since the article itself is scrutinizing the sign system.
  Option E is incorrect since the passage does not mention any political context.
Criticism: 
  It is possible that the author could agree with another option, but the information provided in the passage best aligns with option C.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the radical change in the way we should think about the law due to the neuroscientific idea that all behavior is caused by the operations of the brain, and that people may be deluding themselves into believing they are making free and rational choices.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to
Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work
  B: put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work
  C: acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works
  D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works
  E: explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  Dostoyevsky was a realist who believed that reality was a crucial source of literature.
  He believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it.
  He believed that the fantastic must be intimately bound up with the real.
  He believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit.
Thought:
  The passage implies that Dostoyevsky was critical of the radical critics' view that literature should only be useful.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit.
  Therefore, if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view would be most softened.
  The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")

  Dostoyevsky believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
  The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory.
  
Thought:
  The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. Dostoyevsky believed that the artistic merit of a work was the most important factor, and that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." Dostoyevsky believed that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms. Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky believed that the full significance of artistic merit must be recognized when evaluating literary works. 
  
Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:

  Dostoyevsky believed that both fantasy and reality were crucial in literature.
  Dostoyevsky believed that artistic merit was the most important aspect of a literary work.
  Therefore, if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view would be most softened.
  The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct based on the information provided in the passage.
  However, it is possible that another option, such as acknowledging the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works, could also result in a softened attitude toward the radical critics' view.
  The passage only hints at Dostoyevsky's disagreement with the radical critics on this point, and it is not clear whether a change in the radical critics' position on this would actually soften Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view rejected their demand that art must serve a particular political view.
  He believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  Dostoyevsky defined artistry as the ability to write well and to express thoughts in a way that the reader fully understands the author's thoughts.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky believed that art must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear was a contradiction in terms.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on literary criticism in Russia during his time.
  Dostoyevsky had a third position that went beyond the other two views.
  The radical critics' view was that literature should be useful and must serve political views.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was more than just the tangible aspects of it and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the real world.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if they recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, as this is a position that Dostoyevsky himself held. 
  Dostoyevsky believed that literature should stand or fall on its artistic merit rather than its usefulness.
  He defines "artistic" as the ability to write well and to express thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts.
  Therefore, if the radical critics were to recognize the significance of artistic merit, their views would be more aligned with Dostoyevsky's.
  The other options do not align with Dostoyevsky's position.
Criticism: 
  There is no clear indication in the passage that Dostoyevsky's attitude towards the radical critics' view would be 'most softened' if they recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. 
  While Dostoyevsky values artistry and artistic merit, the passage does not suggest that this is the only way to soften his attitude towards the radical critics' view.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position in Russian literary criticism.
  There were two opposing directions: one that maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, and another that maintained that literature should be useful to create a new society and to find sources in concrete reality.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality is literature's crucial source and that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
  The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if they recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  Therefore, if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, their view would be less objectionable to Dostoyevsky.
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct. 
  The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky values artistic merit in literature over usefulness or political views.
  Therefore, if the radical critics recognized the significance of artistic merit in literature, their view would be more agreeable to Dostoyevsky.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time. 
  One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position that reality was literature's crucial source, but that his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  For Dostoyevsky, reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."

  Therefore, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  Option D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, seems to be the most likely choice.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position, where he thought that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality was deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics. For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. Dostoyevsky believed that artistry is simply the ability to write well and that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." Therefore, if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, they would align more closely with Dostoevsky's position.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoevsky had a third position in regards to literary criticism.
  He believed reality was crucial for literature's source.
  Dostoevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the radical critics.
  Dostoevsky believed there was no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real.
  Dostoevsky believed that literature should not be useful in a political sense alone.
Thought:
  Dostoevsky's disagreement with radical critics is based on their utilitarian view of literature.
  Dostoevsky believed that artistic merit, the ability to write well, should be the primary measure of literature.
  Therefore, Dostoevsky's view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  The other choices do not express any agreement with Dostoevsky's view.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.
  B: Katherine Dunham's ballets were distinct from others produced in North America in that they incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures.
  C: Katherine Dunham's expertise as an anthropologist allowed her to use Caribbean and African dance traditions to express the aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers.
  D: The innovative research methods of Katherine Dunham made possible her discovery that the dance traditions of the Caribbean were derived from earlier African dance traditions.
  E: Katherine Dunham's anthropological and choreographic expertise enabled her to make contributions that altered the landscape of modern dance in North America.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The author is discussing Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music.
- The author notes that Morrison drew upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for the entire novel, simulating the style of a genius of music and creating the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
Thought:
- The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is related to the unique structure of Toni Morrison's Jazz.
- The author notes that Morrison has found a way to simulate the style of a genius of music while still exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity.
- Therefore, the author's assertion is that Morrison has found a way to create a narrative point of view that is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand.
- This assertion is not related to any of the other answer choices.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author is discussing Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and the way in which the narrative structure of the book is similar to the structure of a jazz composition.
  A: This statement is somewhat true, but it does not capture the full complexity of the author's argument about the relationship between Jazz and jazz music.
  B: The author does not mention any earlier twentieth century African American novelists attempting to base their novels on the structure of music.
  C: The author does not make a claim that all novels about nonliterary arts and artists try to emulate the styles of those arts.
  D: The author does not make a generalization about all novels being somewhat musical in nature.
  E: The author does not make a comparison between African American writers and non-African American writers who have written novels about music.
Thought: 
  The author is making an argument about how the structure of Toni Morrison's Jazz is similar to the structure of a jazz composition.
  None of the other answer choices address this argument.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music and jazz composition and performance.
  The author compares the structure of Morrison's novel to the playing of jazz music, where individual musicians improvise within the overall structure of the composer's composition.
Thought: 
  The author discusses Morrison's use of narrative point of view in Jazz and compares it to the structure of jazz music where musicians improvise within the framework of the composer's composition. 
  The author suggests that Morrison has achieved a similar effect in Jazz by allowing characters to speak in their own sections while still maintaining control over the overall narrative. 
  Therefore, if the author were to believe that no other African American novelists had attempted to structure their novels according to the principles of music, then this would be most relevant to the assertion in lines 11-16.
  The correct answer is B.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz as a literary work that uses the structure of jazz music as a model for narration. 
  A: The author's intention to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story is not directly stated in the passage.
  B: The passage does not mention any African American novelists from earlier in the twentieth century who based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
  C: The passage does not make a claim about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists.
  D: The passage does not suggest that any novel can be found to be somewhat musical.
  E: The passage does not provide a comparison of the number of African American writers who have written novels based on music with the number of non-African American writers who have done so.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how Toni Morrison's novel Jazz uses the structure of jazz music as a model for narration. 
  The author makes a reference to the structure of jazz music as an ensemble performance that includes individual solos within an overarching composition. 
  The author compares this structure to the narration of Jazz, which allows individual characters' voices to be heard while maintaining the narrator's overall control of the story. 
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most challenged if there were evidence that Jazz does not use the structure of jazz music as a model for narration.
  A: This is not directly stated in the passage.
  B: This is not relevant to the discussion of Jazz's structure.
  C: This is not a claim made in the passage.
  D: This is not relevant to the discussion of Jazz's structure.
  E: This is not relevant to the discussion of Jazz's structure.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of music as a structuring principle in Toni Morrison's novel Jazz.
  The passage compares the structure of the novel to the structure of jazz music, in which individual performances are woven into an ensemble sound.
Thought:
  The author is discussing the way in which Toni Morrison structures her novel Jazz.
  The novel has a structure that is similar to the structure of jazz music.
  The author is making a comparison between literature and music.
  The author's assertion is in line 11-16.
  Therefore, the author's assertion is that literature and music can have similar structures.
  The correct answer is D, depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature. 
Criticism: 
  The thought process is somewhat correct, but does not fully capture the author's assertion. 
  The author is not making a broad generalization about all novels, but is specifically discussing Morrison's use of a musical structure in Jazz.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel "Jazz" and its connection to music, particularly jazz.
  A: The author does suggest that Toni Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in narrating the story of Jazz.
  B: The passage does not provide any information to support or refute the assertion that some African American novelists have based their work on the typical structure of blues music.
  C: The passage does not make any claims about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists.
  D: The passage focuses specifically on the connection between "Jazz" and music and does not make any general claims about novels.
  E: The passage does not make any claims about the relative numbers of African American and non-African American writers who have written novels about music.
Thought:
  The passage discusses how Toni Morrison used the structure of jazz in narrating her novel "Jazz."
  The author contrasts the fixed scope of the collective narration in the novel with the individuality of the characters' voices, similar to the relationship between a composer and individual musicians in a jazz ensemble.
  The author seems to suggest that this technique is unique to "Jazz" and has not been attempted by other African American writers.
  Therefore, if option B were true, it would call into question the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
  However, since there is no evidence in the passage to support or refute this assertion, it cannot be chosen as the correct answer.
  Option A, on the other hand, aligns with the author's overall argument and supports the assertion in lines 11-16.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of music in literature, particularly in African American literature.
  The passage focuses primarily on Toni Morrison's novel Jazz.
  The author describes how Morrison uses the structure of jazz music to structure her novel.
  The author argues that Morrison's novel redefines the possibilities of narrative point of view.
Thought: 
  The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is that Toni Morrison in her novel Jazz has found a way to structure the narrative like an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  If A were true, that the author intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story, this would strengthen the author's assertion.
  If B were true, that a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, this would be unrelated to the author's assertion about Jazz.
  If C were true, that all novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question, this would be a generalization that is not supported by evidence in the passage.
  If D were true, that depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature, this would be a generalization that does not address the specific use of jazz music in Jazz.
  If E were true, that a smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music, this would be irrelevant to the author's assertion about Jazz.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Criticism: 
  The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is that Morrison has found a way to structure the narrative like an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  The correct answer, A, supports this assertion, but does not capture the full extent of the author's argument.
  The other answer choices are either irrelevant or do not address the specific use of jazz music in Jazz.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and compares its structure to the structure of jazz music.
  The author asserts that Morrison has found a way to create a sense of characters improvising while within the frame of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  A: This choice describes that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of Jazz, which is in line with what the passage discusses.
  B: This choice discusses that a small number of African American novelists in the past have based their novels on the typical structure of blues music, which is not relevant to the passage. 
  C: This choice claims that all novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question, which is not relevant to the passage.
  D: This choice contends that depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature, which is not entirely relevant to the passage.
  E: This choice describes that fewer African American writers than non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music, which is not relevant to the passage.
Thought: 
  The author discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how its structure mimics the structure of jazz music.
  The author asserts that Morrison has found a way to create a sense of characters improvising within the frame of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  Choice A describes that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of Jazz.
  Based on this, choice A would be the most closely related to the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz.
  The novel is set in Harlem in 1926 and uses the structure of jazz music.
Thought:
  The author discusses how Toni Morrison has used the structure of jazz music in her novel Jazz.
  The author compares the narration of the novel to a jazz ensemble.
  The author emphasizes the balance between individual voices and the collective narration.
  The author does not suggest that this approach is commonly taken by authors writing about nonliterary arts and artists, nor do they suggest that other African American writers have attempted this.
  Therefore, answer choices C, D, and E can be eliminated.
  Answer choice A is close to the author's assertion, but it includes the word "intentionally," which is not stated in the passage.
  Answer choice B is not mentioned in the passage and does not pertain to Toni Morrison's novel.
  Thus, the best answer is B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
Criticism:
  The passage does not discuss African American novelists who based the form of their work on blues music.
  The passage focuses on Toni Morrison's use of jazz music in her novel Jazz.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses Toni Morrison's novel "Jazz".
  The novel is set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926.
  The author analyzes the way in which the story is told.
  The narration shifts between third-person omniscience and first-person lyricism.
  The structure of the novel is analogous to the playing of a jazz hand, with ensemble sound and individuality of embedded solo performances.
Thought:
  The author discusses how the narration shifts between perspectives and how the novel's structure is similar to jazz music.
  The author believes that the novel's structure is similar to that of a jazz composer who constructs compositions with individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind.
  The author asserts that Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  The author believes that Morrison's rendering of jazz is a literary achievement that redefines the possibilities of narrative point of view.
  None of the answer choices aligns perfectly with the author's assertion, but Option A comes closest, as it states that the author intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Criticism:
  The article does not explicitly state that the author intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story, but the author does describe the structure of the novel as being similar to that of jazz music.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage describes two sides of a debate regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. It then introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, that reconciles the two positions. The principle is applied to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice. The passage demonstrates that the two positions are complementary and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 1:
Answer: B
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

The organization of the passage is most accurately described as B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them. The passage presents two opposing views on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, followed by an economic principle of utility maximization that reconciles the two views. The principle is used to analyze the decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice and to show that the two methods of crime deterrence have the same overall effect. The economic principle is applied to decide between the two sides of the debate and to demonstrate that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Response 3:
Answer: B
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

The organization of the passage is best described as "Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them." The passage first describes two opposing views on how to deter deliberate crimes, then introduces an economic principle (utility maximization) to show that these two views are not in conflict and in fact, can work together. The economic principle is used to analyze the rational decision-making process of an individual committing a crime and how it can be influenced by different deterrence methods. Therefore, the economic principle is used to decide between the two sides of the debate.
Response 5:
Answer: B
Response 6:
Answer: B
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

The organization of the passage is as follows:
- The introductory paragraph presents a problem currently being debated in the legal community: how to deter deliberate crimes.
- The second paragraph outlines two opposing positions on the issue: one that emphasizes societal factors and one that emphasizes individual choice and the need for harsher penalties.
- The third paragraph introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, that can reconcile the two opposing positions by showing that they have the same overall effect.
- The fourth paragraph explains how utility maximization can be used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
- The fifth paragraph demonstrates how the two deterrence methods proposed by the opposing positions work within the framework of utility maximization, ultimately showing that they are complementary rather than conflicting.
Therefore, the best answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage describes two sides of a debate regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud.

Therefore, the passage is best described as presenting two sides of a debate and applying an economic principle to decide between them. The correct answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage describes two sides of a debate regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud. One side believes that societal norms and institutions are the primary factors influencing the decision to commit a deliberate crime, while the other side believes that the decision is primarily the result of individual choice. However, the passage introduces an economic principle of utility maximization that reconciles the two positions. The principle demonstrates that both deterrence strategies have the same overall effect because they both affect the expected utility of committing a crime. Therefore, the organization of the passage is best described as presenting two sides of a debate and then applying an economic principle to decide between them. The correct answer is B.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the function of the third paragraph within the passage as a whole?
Choices:
  A: to refute traditional interpretations of certain artifacts

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.

Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes how scientists discovered the planet Neptune.
  Scientists used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict Uranus's orbit. But their predictions failed, and they eventually hypothesized that another planet existed, which they called Neptune, and which was later discovered.
  A: Galileo proposed the theory of tides, but his theory predicted one high tide per day instead of two.
  B: Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right in observing variable stars but his discovery did not result in hypothesizing a new planet.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated about the extinction of the dinosaurs based on the observation of high levels of iridium in rock samples, later evidence confirmed his postulation.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field and concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third undetected particle during the decay of a neutron, its existence was later confirmed.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes how scientists discovered the planet Neptune by hypothesizing its existence to solve the orbital errors of Uranus and then observing it.
  The most analogous scientific episode is where scientists hypothesized the existence of a new planet (Neptune) to solve an observation prediction error.
  The extinction hypothesis of Walter Alvarez was also confirmed with later evidence, but it did not result in hypothesizing a new planet.
  Similarly, other scientific episodes either did not hypothesize a new planet or observe one to solve an error in predictions.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Galileo's theory of tides that predicted one high tide per day instead of two.
Criticism: 
  The discovery of Neptune is analogous to not just hypothesizing a new planet but also observing it through a telescope to solve an observation prediction error. 
  The discovery of the correct orbit of Mercury through Einstein's theory also shares similiarities with this type of discovery.
  But the other options do not share the same similiarities with the discovery of Neptune.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers discovered the planet Neptune based on deviations from predicted orbits for Uranus. 
  A: Galileo's theory of tides is not related to predicting orbits of celestial objects. 
  B: Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy is not related to predicting orbits of celestial objects. 
  C: Walter Alvarez's discovery of an impact crater is not related to predicting orbits of celestial objects. 
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery of magnetized rocks is not related to predicting orbits of celestial objects. 
  E: Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of a third particle is not related to predicting orbits of celestial objects.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes how scientists observed the predicted orbit of Uranus and then hypothesized that there was another planet nearby causing deviations in its orbit. 
  The scientists then used this hypothesis to predict the location of Neptune and found it. 
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is one where scientists hypothesized the existence of an unknown object that accounted for deviations from predicted measurements and then found the object.
  Answer choice C describes an unknown cause for a known effect, which is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Answer choices A, B, D, and E are not related to predicting or finding unknown objects based on deviations from predicted measurements.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, D, or E.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune by astronomers, who predicted its existence based on Newton's laws, but modified their auxiliary assumptions to account for the observed orbit of Uranus. They hypothesized the existence of a new planet, which was later found in the correct location.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides is false because it did not predict two high tides per day.
  B: Edwin Hubble discovered Andromeda is a galaxy in its own right by observing variable stars.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated an asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on high levels of iridium in certain rock samples. An impact crater was later discovered that supported his theory.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to Earth's magnetic field, suggesting that the field must have reversed at some point in the past.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of an undetected particle to explain apparent inconsistencies with the law of conservation of energy during neutron decay.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes the prediction and discovery of Neptune with modified auxiliary assumptions based on Newton's laws. 
  The correct answer is the episode that is most analogous to this process.
  Passage A notes that scientific theories rely on auxiliary premises, and that a failed prediction does not necessarily disprove the main theory.
  The episode that best matches this process is C, where Alvarez postulates that an asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on auxiliary evidence, and later discovers an impact crater that supports his theory. 
  The discovery of Neptune based on revised auxiliary assumptions is a similar process, as the auxiliary premises were modified to account for the observed orbit of Uranus.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Walter Alvarez postulated an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on auxiliary evidence, and later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
Criticism: 
  There is no clear connection between the discovery of Neptune and the extinction of the dinosaurs. 
  While both involved hypotheses that were later supported by evidence, the processes by which they were discovered are not sufficiently similar.
  Alternatively, while Passage A notes the role of auxiliary premises in scientific theories, Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune by modifying assumptions based on Newton's laws, which is more similar to the process described in option A, where Galileo's theory of tides required the modification of its assumptions. 
  Therefore, the answer could also be A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes astronomers attempting to predict the orbit of a planet (Uranus), based on previous knowledge and auxiliary assumptions. 
  The predictions were incorrect, and scientists tried to explain the failure by revising their assumptions. 
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet, which led to the discovery of Neptune in the predicted location.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides incorrectly predicted the number of high tides per day based on Earth's motion around the sun. 
  B: Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda was actually a separate galaxy, not just part of the Milky Way, by observing variable stars. 
  C: Walter Alvarez hypothesized that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered. 
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in the opposite direction of Earth's magnetic field, suggesting that the field had reversed in the past. 
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of an undetected particle to explain an apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes scientists attempting to predict the orbit of Uranus based on auxiliary assumptions and previous knowledge. 
  Their predictions were incorrect and they revised their assumptions to hypothesize the existence of another planet, which led to the discovery of Neptune.
  The most analogous scientific episode is one in which scientists had to revise their assumptions to discover something new.
  Option A is not analogous because Galileo's theory did not lead to a new discovery or hypothesis.
  Option B is not analogous because Hubble's observations did not require revising assumptions to discover something new.
  Option C is not analogous because the discovery of the dinosaur extinction impact crater did not involve revising assumptions to hypothesize a new planet or object.
  Option D is not analogous because Brunhes' discovery did not require revising assumptions to discover something new.
  Option E is not analogous because Pauli's postulated particle was not discovered through the revision of assumptions.
  Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
Criticism: 
  The answer must be the most likely option, even if it is not a perfect analogy. 
  Option A is not about revising assumptions, but it is about incorrect predictions leading to a revised theory. 
  Option B is not about revising assumptions, but it is about new observations leading to a revised theory. 
  Option C is not about revising assumptions to hypothesize a new planet, but it is about revising assumptions to hypothesize a new cause for an event. 
  Option D is not about revising assumptions to hypothesize a new planet, but it is about revising assumptions to explain a new phenomenon.
  Option E is not about revising assumptions to hypothesize a new planet, but it is about postulating a new particle to explain a phenomenon.
  Option C seems to be the most likely because it involves revising assumptions based on new evidence and hypothesizing a new cause for an event. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The question asks which episode is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as described in Passage B.
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, but the prediction was incorrect due to another planet's existence. They later discovered Neptune in the predicted location, which explained the incorrect orbit of Uranus.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted only one high tide per day, while in fact there are two high tides per day. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  B: Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  C: Walter Alvarez's postulation of an asteroid impact causing the extinction of the dinosaurs is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery of magnetized rocks is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of a third undetected particle during neutron decay is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
Thought:
  As described in Passage B, astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus incorrectly, but correctly predicted the location of Neptune, which explained Uranus's orbit.
  Therefore, the discovery of Neptune can be described as correcting an incorrect prediction based on auxiliary assumptions and finding the correct explanation for the incorrect prediction.
  In a similar way, discovering the correct explanation for an incorrect prediction based on auxiliary assumptions occurred in one of the episodes described.
  Walter Alvarez's postulation of an asteroid impact causing the extinction of the dinosaurs is not analogous because it does not involve correcting an incorrect prediction based on auxiliary assumptions.
  Brunhes's discovery of magnetized rocks and Pauli's postulation of a third undetected particle do not involve correcting an incorrect prediction.
  Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy is not analogous because it does not involve correcting an incorrect prediction based on auxiliary assumptions.
  Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted only one high tide per day, but the analogy between Galileo's theory and the discovery of Neptune is not clear.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: Galileo's theory of tides. 
Criticism:
  One might argue that the analogy between Galileo's theory of tides and the discovery of Neptune is not strong enough to be the best answer.
  Passage B involves a specific process of making predictions based on auxiliary assumptions and then discovering new information that corrects the prediction.
  Galileo's theory of tides does not involve making a prediction based on auxiliary assumptions in the same way as Uranus's orbit, and the correction of the prediction is not as clear as the correction involved in the discovery of Neptune.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune.
  Astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, but the orbit did not match their predictions.
  Astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, and Neptune was later discovered in that precise location, bringing the predictions into alignment with observations.
Thought:
  The episode described in Passage B involves incorrect predictions of a planet's orbit based on existing laws and assumptions, followed by the hypothesizing of the existence of another planet, which was later discovered in the right location. 
  Of the given choices, option B involves the discovery of a galaxy that resolves a debate about the universe, but it is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune. 
  Option C involves postulating that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on evidence of high levels of iridium in rock core samples and later discovering evidence of an impact crater. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune. 
  Option D involves discovering rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field and concluding that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune. 
  Option E involves postulating the existence of an undetected particle to explain apparent discrepancies in the law of conservation of energy, and later confirming the particle's existence. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune. 
  Therefore, the answer is A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two. This involves incorrect predictions based on an existing theory and the later discovery of a new phenomenon that resolves the contradiction, which is analogous to discovering Neptune. 
Criticism:
  None. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune based on observations that didn't match predictions based on calculations using Newton's laws.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides did not match observations, but it is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  B: Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  C: Walter Alvarez's postulation of asteroid impact causing dinosaur extinction is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune. 
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery of magnetized rocks with the opposite magnetic field is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of an undetected particle to conserve energy is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes how the discovery of Neptune was made based on observations that didn't match predictions based on calculations using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about other planets. 
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. 
  Later, Neptune was discovered in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune in passage B is the episode where astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets to explain the observations. 
  The best choice is B.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the logic to select choice B as the most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  In the passage B, astronomers used Newton's laws to predict the orbit of Uranus but found that their predictions were incorrect.
  The astronomers eventually hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune. Later, Neptune was discovered in the precise place it would have to be.
Thought:
  The passage B talks about how scientists using Newton's laws hypothesized the existence of a planet in the vicinity of Uranus and then discovered Neptune in the precise place it would have to be.
  The hypothesis was made to explain the deviation in the orbit of Uranus.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as described in the passage B, is the discovery of Vulcan to explain the orbit of Mercury.
  As in the case of Uranus, scientists found that the predictions of the orbit of Mercury were incorrect. They hypothesized the existence of another planet, called Vulcan, in the vicinity of Mercury to explain the deviation.
  However, Vulcan was never found.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")

  C: Walter Alvarez explained dinosaur extinction as the result of an impact by a large asteroid.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of Earth's present magnetic field.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third particle created during neutron decay to resolve the contradiction with the law of conservation of energy.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes scientists' discovery of Neptune as the result of a failed prediction of Uranus's orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The discovery of Vulcan was a failed prediction that there was another planet in the vicinity of Mercury.
  A, B, C, and E do not involve failed predictions of orbits of celestial bodies or the search for an explanation based on auxiliary assumptions.
  D does not involve failed predictions of orbits of celestial bodies.
  Therefore, none of the options is analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis of the question is correct in that none of the options is analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  However, the prompt asks for the option that is most analogous, even if it is not a perfect analogy. It is possible to argue that option C is more analogous than the other options, as it involves a scientific discovery that was based on identifying an anomaly and then searching for an explanation that involves auxiliary assumptions.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the difference between voluntary and involuntary risks, and how laypeople and policy experts view these risks.
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks should not be the basis for determining government intervention.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that the author does not agree with the concept of protecting only against involuntary risks.
  The author argues that the characterizations of voluntariness are often based on selective attention or judgments about the purpose for which risks are taken.
  The author argues that government intervention should focus on saving lives, with departures from this principle requiring specific justifications.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with the statement that the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  This aligns with the author's argument that judgments about voluntariness are often misguided and that the focus should be on saving lives.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
Thought:
  The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "voluntary" or "involuntary" are not very useful in guiding policy decisions. Instead, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. Therefore, the author would be unlikely to agree with any statement that argues that risks should be deemed "voluntary" or "involuntary."
  Choice A argues that people should not be protected against risks incurred through dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose. However, the passage does not take a clear stance on this issue, and the author may not agree.
  Choice B argues that policy experts would typically consider the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety. While the author does not explicitly address this point, the argument that judgments about voluntariness are often based on confusion and selective attention suggests that the author may agree that the fact that victims chose to fly is not the most important factor in making policy decisions.
  Choice C makes a claim about the relative risks of plane crashes compared to other kinds of risks incurred by airline passengers. The passage does not provide any evidence to support or refute this claim, and it is not clear whether the author would agree.
  Choice D argues that a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. However, the passage argues that judgments about voluntariness are often based on confusion and selective attention and that notions of voluntariness are not very useful in guiding policy decisions. Therefore, the author would be unlikely to agree with this statement.
  Choice E argues that the main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster. However, the passage does not provide any evidence to support or refute this claim, and it is not clear whether the author would agree.
  Therefore, the best choice is B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk and how it is viewed by different groups.
  The author believes that the distinction is often based on flawed judgments and is of little use in guiding policy decisions.
Thought: 
  The author's position is that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  The government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  The author is critical of judgments about voluntariness that stem from confusion and selective attention, as well as judgments that are based on disapproval of the purpose for which people run the risks.
  None of the statements provided explicitly matches the author's views, but of the given options, A is the closest.
  The author does not advocate for no protection against risks like skydiving, but does argue that better understanding of judgments about voluntariness should guide regulatory policy.
Criticism: 
  Option A is not a complete match for the author's position.
  While the author argues that better understanding of judgments about voluntariness should guide regulatory policy, the passage does not advocate for complete lack of protection against risks incurred through dangerous activities with no socially useful purpose.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks regarding individual and government responsibility.
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is often based on selective attention, confusion, and antecedent judgments, and is of little use in guiding policy decisions.
Thought: 
  The author argues that regulatory policy should focus on saving as many lives as possible within the limits of public and private resources devoted to risk reduction, rather than relying on the notion of voluntariness.
  A: The passage argues against relying on notions of voluntariness as a proxy for deciding government regulation of risk, rather than advocating for or against the protection of dangerous activities such as skydiving.
  B: The passage suggests that the decision to fly is relevant, but perhaps not decisive, in decisions about government regulation of air safety.
  C: The passage does not provide any statistics or direct comparisons of the risks of different kinds of risks incurred by airline passengers.
  D: The passage suggests that the determination of a risk as voluntary or involuntary is not straightforward, but rather a matter of degree and sometimes influenced by disapproval of the activity.
  E: The passage does not make any claim about the category of risk that is incurred completely involuntarily.
  The statement that is most consistent with the author's argument is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk and how this affects judgments about risk by laypeople and policy experts.
- The author argues that judgments about voluntariness are often based on confusion and selective attention and should not be the main factor in policy decisions about risk regulation.
Thought:
- The author argues that policy decisions should be guided by attempts to save as many lives as possible, subject to limited resources.
- The author also argues that notions of voluntariness should not be the main factor in policy decisions.
- The author does not express a belief that dangerous activities serving no socially useful purpose should not be protected against risks.
- The author acknowledges that voluntariness may be relevant in some cases, such as when people choose to fly, but suggests that this should not be the main factor in policy decisions.
- The author does not discuss the probability of occurrence or injury for plane crashes relative to other risks.
- The author suggests that voluntariness should be based on a person's ability to choose whether to subject themselves to the risk.
- The author does not discuss the risk of natural disasters as being the main category of risk incurred involuntarily.
- Based on the author's arguments and the choices given, the best answer would be D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. 
Criticism:
- It is possible that the author may not agree with this statement, as it is not explicitly stated in the passage. The author does argue that voluntariness should not be the main factor in policy decisions, but also acknowledges that it may be relevant in some cases.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk and how this distinction is often used by laypeople to make judgments about risk.
  The author argues that this distinction is not always useful and that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
Thought:
  The author argues against the notion that risks should be deemed "voluntary" or "involuntary" and instead argues that regulatory policy should focus on saving lives.
  Option A is similar to this argument, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the passage that activities like skydiving "serve no socially useful purpose." Therefore, Option A is not the correct answer.
  Option B is not supported by the passage, which argues that judgments about voluntariness are not always useful and should not be the primary focus of regulatory policy.
  Option C is not discussed in the passage and is therefore not the correct answer.
  Option D accurately describes the author's argument that a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are subject to that risk only as a result of a particular choice.
  Option E is not supported by the passage, which does not make any claims about the main category of risk that is usually incurred involuntarily.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. 
Criticism:
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not always useful in making policy decisions, but it is not entirely clear that the author would agree with Option D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk.
  The author argues that the distinction is not always useful in guiding policy decisions.
Thought: 
  The author argues that regulatory policy should be guided by saving as many lives as possible, subject to limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  The author also argues that notions of voluntariness should not be used as proxies for justifying departures from this principle.
  Therefore, the author would most likely not agree with choice A, which says that people should generally not be protected against risks incurred through dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose.
  The author also argues that judgments about voluntariness are often based on confusion and selective attention, and are of little utility in guiding policy decisions.
  Therefore, the author would most likely not agree with choice B, which says that plane crash victims' choice to fly would usually be deemed irrelevant to decisions about government regulation of air safety by policy experts.
  The passage does not provide information to support choice C, which makes a specific claim about the probability of occurrence and probability of resulting death or injury for plane crashes and other risks incurred by airline passengers.
  The author argues that it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred, and that notions of voluntariness are often used to justify policy decisions based on other considerations.
  Therefore, the author would most likely not agree with choice D, which says that a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  The passage does not provide information to support choice E, which makes a specific claim about the main category of risk that is usually incurred involuntarily.
  Overall, the author argues that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness, and by saving as many lives as possible, subject to limited resources devoted to risk reduction.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk.
  The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention.
Thought:
  The author argues that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. 
  The government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would most likely agree with the statement that people should generally be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purposes.
  The author would likely argue that if the government's resources can be used to save lives, then they should be, regardless of whether the risk was voluntarily incurred.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk.
  The author argues that regulatory policy should be based on saving as many lives as possible.
Thought:
  The author argues against using the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks to guide policy decisions.
  Instead, policy should focus on saving as many lives as possible.
  Therefore, the author would most likely disagree with A because it implies that people should not be protected against voluntarily incurred risks.
  The author does not express a specific opinion about the relevance of the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly, so B cannot be inferred from the passage.
  The passage does not provide evidence to support C.
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not useful for policy decisions, so D is not likely to be the correct answer.
  The passage does not mention natural disasters, so E cannot be inferred from the passage.
  The best answer is D because the author argues against using the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks to guide policy decisions.
Criticism:
  Your answer is incorrect. 
  The correct inference from the passage is that the author would most likely disagree with D because the author argues against using the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks to guide policy decisions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explores the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks.
Thought: 
  The author argues that notions of "voluntary" and "involuntary" risks are not particularly helpful in guiding regulatory policy decisions. Instead, the government should aim to save as many lives as it can, subject to the resources available for risk reduction. The passage does not suggest whether or not the government should regulate specific activities or whether dangerous activities have social usefulness. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect.
Option C is incorrect because the passage does not make any comparisons between plane crashes and other risks incurred by airline passengers. 
Option D is not entirely accurate because the passage discusses the difficulty in determining if a risk is voluntarily incurred and the fact that people's judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention. 
Option E is incorrect because the passage notes that while risks like unforeseeable collisions with asteroids may be involuntary, for most environmental, occupational and other social risks, voluntariness is not an all-or-nothing matter.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: According to the passage, why do university researchers increasingly believe that patents should be granted for commercially promising biotechnology discoveries?
Choices:
  A: Researchers' prospects for academic advancement depend on both the quality and the quantity of their research.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The thin layer of ozone in the stratosphere screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer, reducing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  CFCs chemically attack the ozone layer and deplete it by releasing chlorine.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt public policy response to address the issue of ozone depletion.
Thought: 
  The passage provides information on the depletion of the ozone layer due to CFCs and its impact on the effectiveness of the ozone layer as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. 
  There is no information in the passage that talks about the natural occurrence of ozone destruction in the stratosphere. Therefore, option A is incorrect.
  Excessive absorption of ultraviolet light is one of the causes of skin cancer, but the passage does not suggest that it is the primary cause. Therefore, option B is incorrect.
  The passage does not provide any information on other chemicals besides CFCs that can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere. Therefore, option C is incorrect.
  The passage indicates that the depletion of the ozone layer leads to an increase in ultraviolet radiation, which can be harmful to human health. Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs can indirectly contribute to lowering the incidence of skin cancer. Hence, option D is the best answer.
  There is no information in the passage that suggests that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica. Therefore, option E is incorrect.
Criticism: 
  The thought process is logical and the selected option is well-supported by the information provided in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:

  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
Thought: 
  The passage provides information about how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, releasing chlorine into the stratosphere.
  Chlorine and ozone react in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates chlorine atoms.
  Therefore, the regulation of CFC use contributes directly to protecting the ozone layer, which in turn shields against ultraviolet radiation that contributes to skin cancer.

Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Ultraviolet radiation contributes to skin cancer.
- The ozone layer is a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
- CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
- Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
- The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
Thought:
- The passage supports the idea that CFCs contribute to the destruction of the ozone layer and that this destruction leads to a decrease in the effectiveness of the ozone layer as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
- The passage does not provide evidence to support statement A that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
- The passage mentions that ultraviolet radiation contributes to skin cancer (as opposed to statement B which claims that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light).
- The passage mentions the harmful effects of CFCs on the ozone layer but does not say that few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere. Therefore, statement C is not strongly supported by the information in the passage.
- The passage does not mention a direct link between regulating the use of CFCs and the incidence of skin cancer. However, since CFCs contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, which is a shield against ultraviolet radiation that contributes to skin cancer, it is possible that regulating the use of CFCs indirectly helps to lower the incidence of skin cancer. Therefore, statement D is the most strongly supported by the information in the passage.
- The passage does not mention that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica. Therefore, statement E is not supported by the information in the passage.

  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere (not supported).
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer (possible).
Thought: 
  Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland's research showed how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  By depleting the ozone layer, more ultraviolet radiation reaches the earth's surface, which could lead to more skin cancer.
  Regulating the use of CFCs, which contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, will help protect the ozone layer, which can indirectly lower the incidence of skin cancer.
  Therefore, statement D is most strongly supported by the information in the passage.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide a direct link between the regulation of CFCs and the lowering incidence of skin cancer. 
  Although a reduction in the depletion of the ozone layer could help protect against skin cancer, it is hard to say whether it would directly lower the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")

  Molina and Rowland's advocacy of dramatic policy changes led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer when they diffuse upward into the stratosphere and break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Since CFCs are the main source of chlorine in the stratosphere, their production ban should contribute indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  Therefore, D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer, is most strongly supported by the information in the passage.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  The ozone layer, which is located in the stratosphere, screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  Manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured CFCs can destroy the ozone layer and become a pressing environmental threat.
Thought: 
  The passage states that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  This implies that the depletion of ozone is not natural and happens due to the presence of CFCs.
  The passage does not provide information about the relationship between skin cancers and the regulation of CFCs.
  The passage also does not state that only CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  Antarctica is only mentioned in the passage as the location of the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  This is supported by the passage's discussion of how CFCs chemically react with the ozone layer to create and regenerate chlorine atoms that destroy ozone molecules.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) can chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  This depletion diminishes the effectiveness of the ozone layer as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The depletion of the ozone layer can lead to an increase in skin cancer cases due to the increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
Thought:
  The passage describes the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer and how it leads to an increase in skin cancer cases due to the increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs, which contributes to the stabilization of the ozone layer, may indirectly lower the incidence of skin cancer.
  This is best represented by the statement: D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  The ozone layer in the stratosphere shields the earth from much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  CFCs were used in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants.
  Molina and Rowland were the pioneering researchers who alerted policy makers to the fragility of the ozone layer and the destruction caused by CFCs.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer by releasing chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  It also mentions that chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Therefore, the statement that "Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present" is most strongly supported by the information in the passage.
  Statements B, C, and E are not supported by the passage.
  Statement D could be indirectly supported by the passage, as regulating the use of CFCs contributes to the protection of the ozone layer, which in turn shields the earth from ultraviolet radiation that contributes to skin cancer.
Criticism: 
  The statement "Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present" is not explicitly stated in the passage.
  It is known that natural production and destruction of ozone in the stratosphere should remain in rough equilibrium.
  However, the passage suggests that the presence of chlorine from CFCs leads to an increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere, which is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Therefore, the statement could be interpreted as a reasonable inference based on the information in the passage rather than a directly supported statement.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  The sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone in the stratosphere.
  Manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium.
  Each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
Thought: 
  CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is a pressing environmental threat.
  Regulating the use of CFCs would result in lower depletion of the ozone layer, leading to a reduction in skin cancer caused by excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  The other statements are not supported by the information in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
- Ultraviolet light contributes to skin cancer.
- Ozone is a toxic form of oxygen and it creates a thin layer in the stratosphere that screens out the most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
- Stratospheric ozone concentrations remain stable with natural production and destruction of the ozone in equilibrium.
- Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are highly volatile chemicals that were used in many products including aerosol sprays and refrigerants. 
- CFCs destroy the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
- The release of CFCs into the atmosphere slowly diffuses upward into the stratosphere. 
- CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, and this results in an increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere.
- Chlorine and ozone react to destroy the ozone and regenerate the chlorine atoms. 
- Molina and Rowland alerted public policy makers worldwide to the fragility of the ozone layer through their research and advocacy.
- The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
- Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response.
Thought: 
- The passage provides information that CFCs are the main cause of the destruction of the ozone layer, and that the destruction of the ozone layer reduces its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation, which is known to contribute to skin cancer. 
- Therefore, we can logically conclude that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
- This statement is most strongly supported by the information in the passage.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Therefore, the answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The third paragraph discusses the social classes that were able to commission art in history - the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class.
  The taste of these classes has not always produced art that endured.
Thought:
  The third paragraph begins by stating that historically only two social classes were able to commission art, the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class.
  It then argues that the taste of these classes has not always been able to produce art that endures, with evidence cited in the form of cultural critic Matthew Arnold's characterization of the aristocracy as being interested in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as being obsessed with respectability.
  It is therefore identifying assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph, specifically the assumption that elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  Therefore, the answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.

  It also mentions that some artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment and that some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
Thought:
  The third paragraph mainly discusses the limitations of the sociohistorical critic's analysis of art produced by the elite.
  It points out that the elite had a diverse range of tastes and that some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly.
  The paragraph identifies assumptions relied upon by the sociohistorical critic, namely that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
  The answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Criticism:
  I think your answer is correct. Good job!

Response 5:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to:
Knowledge:
The third paragraph discusses the limitations of analyzing art produced by the aristocratic and upper-middle class. The analysis relies on the assumption that the elite had a recognizable identity and a consensus about the ideal way of life.
Thought:
The author argues that the aristocracy and the upper-middle class often had poor taste in art and thus were not always able to produce enduring works of art. The author also argues that artists who disagreed with the ideals of their patrons sometimes produced art that went against the grain of elite values. The author recognizes that the sociohistorical critic must engage in a Freudian analysis to understand how this art embodied the ideals of the elite that they disapproved of.
The purpose of the third paragraph is to identify the assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph, namely, the sociohistorical interpretation of art produced by and for the political and social elite. Therefore, the answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the ways that historically, art has been produced for and by political and social elites.
  The third paragraph begins with "Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin," indicating that it is addressing a certain type of analysis mentioned in the first paragraph.
Thought:
  The third paragraph is discussing the assumptions that must be made for the type of analysis mentioned in the first paragraph to work.
  Specifically, the analysis must assume that the elite have a recognizable identity and display some kind of consensus about the world and the way life is to be lived.
  Additionally, the analysis must be able to eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.
  The paragraph does not reject a possible response to the argument made in the first paragraph, present an argument that weakens the argument made in the second paragraph, offer additional evidence for the conclusion reached in the second paragraph, or draw a definitive conclusion from the claims made in the second paragraph.
  Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. 

Explanation:
The third paragraph explains the assumptions made by sociohistorical critics, such as Taruskin, about the way art was produced and commissioned by the elite class. It also discusses the limitations of this type of analysis and how it may not always accurately reflect the ideals and tastes of the elite. Therefore, the main function of the paragraph is to provide more information about the assumptions underlying the analysis referred to in the first paragraph. This aligns with choice B.
Response 8:
Knowledge: The third paragraph discusses the two classes that historically commissioned art, the aristocratic and the well-to-do middle class. It also talks about how the taste of these classes was not always apt to produce enduring art and how some talented artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment. Moreover, it discusses how a lot of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. 
Thought: The first sentence of paragraph three introduces the two classes that historically commissioned art and discusses how their taste was not always apt to produce enduring art. The rest of the paragraph discusses the eccentric tastes of rich patrons and how establishments unwillingly paid for art that contradicted elite values. The primary function of this paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")

  B: to illustrate the influence of religion on the historical development of art
  C: to present an example of the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist
  D: to show how an artist can subvert the ideals of the patron
  E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses two ways that art was historically produced for political and social elites: by commissioning a well-known artist to produce something for display, or by creating a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example of the second way.
Thought: 
  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to illustrate the second way that art was historically produced for political and social elites: by creating a work that expresses and mirrors one's ideals and way of life.
  Therefore, the answer is C: to present an example of the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the author mentions Raphael's frescoes to illustrate a type of relationship between a patron and an artist. 
  However, the answer should be more specific to indicate that the frescoes illustrate the second way that art was produced for political and social elites: by creating a work that expresses and mirrors one's ideals and way of life.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The author discusses two different ways that art was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display while the second way was to create a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life. The author then mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments, commissioned by Pope Julius II, to illustrate the second way.
Thought: The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example of art produced the second way, where a work expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life. The frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, so they were produced for a member of the elite. This illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses two ways that art was "produced by and for political and social elites".
  Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments were a work of art commissioned by Pope Julius II, a member of the elite.
Thought: 
  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to provide an example of a work of art that reflects the ideals and way of life of a member of the elite, commissioned by the patron in the second way that art was historically "produced by and for political and social elites". 
  The author discusses this type of art production to contrast it with the first way that art was produced for the elite and to show why sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with the second type.
  Therefore, the answer is A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.
  The frescoes were commissioned by a member of the elite, Pope Julius II, and represent the type of art production that sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze because it reflects the ideology of the patron.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses two ways that art was produced for the elites in history. 
  Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments were created as a way to express and mirror one's ideals and way of life.
Thought:
  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to present an example of the first way that art was produced for the elites, which is not the preferred pattern of sociohistorical critics.
  The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display.
  Raphael's frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, who was a member of the elite.
  The frescoes expressed and mirrored the Pope's ideals and way of life, rather than subverting them.
  Therefore, the frescoes were produced in a way that was typical of the relationship between a patron and an artist, but do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics, who prefer to deal with art produced in the second way.
  The answer is C: to present an example of the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist.
Criticism:
  There is no mention in the passage that Raphael's frescoes are the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist.
  However, it is clear that the frescoes were mentioned as an example to illustrate the first way that art was produced for the elites, which is through a patron commissioning an artist to produce something for display.
  Therefore, the answer C is still the best choice among the given options.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses two ways in which art has been "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The first way is for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display.
  The second way is to create or have created a work that expresses and mirrors one's ideals and way of life.
  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example of the second way.
Thought:
  The author discusses Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example of a work of art that reflects the ideals and way of life of the elite.
  This is an example of the second way in which art has been "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The author is not using this example to illustrate the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics, or the influence of religion on art, or how an artist can subvert the ideals of the patron.
  The author is also not using the example to discuss the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist.
  The example is being used to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
  Therefore, the answer is E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.

  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II, but the purpose of the mention is not immediately clear.
Thought: 
  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to provide an example that illustrates the second way that art was "produced by and for political and social elites," 
  Specifically, the frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II and were intended to express and mirror his ideals and way of life.
  This example fits within the framework preferred by sociohistorical critics, who attempt to analyze the way that art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  Therefore, the answer is A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, who was a member of the political and social elite. 
  However, the purpose of the frescoes was not to illustrate the second way mentioned by the author of art that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, but rather to depict scenes from the Bible and promote the power of the Catholic Church.
  So, while the frescoes might be an example of art produced by and for political and social elites, they do not fit within the framework that the author is discussing.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments.
Thought:
  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments right after describing the second way art was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments were commissioned by Pope Julius II.
  Therefore, the author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to present an example of the second way art was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The answer is E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
Criticism:
  Your answer is not completely incorrect.
  However, the answer A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics is a better fit.
  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example of art that embodied the ideology of the elite.
  This example fits the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics, who analyze the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses two different ways in which art was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The second way involved creating or commissioning a work that expressed the ideals and way of life of the elite.
  Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments were commissioned by Pope Julius II.
Thought:
  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to illustrate an example of the second way in which art was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, a member of the ruling elite.
  The frescoes reflected the ideals and way of life of the Pope and the Catholic Church.
  The author uses this example to support the argument that sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze art that embodies the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.
  Therefore, the answer is A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.
Criticism:
  Your analysis correctly identifies that the author uses Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to illustrate an example of art produced for political and social elites.
  However, the statement "the frescoes reflected the ideals and way of life of the Pope and the Catholic Church" is incorrect. 
  While it is true that the frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, they are not necessarily reflective of his personal ideals or way of life. 
  Rather, the frescoes were intended to reflect the values and teachings of the Catholic Church in general.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements
  B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines
  C: a hypothetical situation supporting a statement reported by the author in the earlier lines
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligations of defense lawyers to their clients, the courts, and society.
  Some legal scholars argue that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, regardless of their personal beliefs about their clients' innocence or guilt.
  Other scholars argue that lawyers have a duty to be truthful and not present assertions they know to be false.
Thought: 
  Lines 28-31 state that when lawyers are certain that their clients are guilty, they should not try to prove their innocence. Instead, they should present any extenuating circumstances and argue for leniency in sentencing.
  This thought relates directly to the earlier discussion about lawyers' obligations to be truthful and not present false assertions.
  The earlier discussion argues that lawyers have an obligation to the court and society, not just to their clients, and should not make false statements to the court.
  The later discussion agrees with this and argues that when lawyers are certain that their clients are guilty, they should not try to make false assertions of innocence.
  The two discussions are in agreement with each other and together present a consistent position about lawyers' obligations to their clients and the court.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that the positions in lines 28-31 and lines 7-11 are arising from different perspectives.
  The positions are not equivalent; they are complementary, with the later position expanding on the earlier position.
  A better answer might be that they are "two positions that are in agreement with each other and together present a consistent position about lawyers' obligations to their clients and the court."
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligations of defense lawyers to their clients and society, and the appropriate level of advocacy for each situation.
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 28–31 states that defense lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their clients' innocence if they are convinced that their clients are guilty. 
  Earlier, legal scholars claim that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of and that the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate.
  These two statements are not in agreement over the level of advocacy required from lawyers in cases where the lawyers believe their clients are guilty.
  The two statements are related to the topic of the obligations of defense lawyers to their clients and society, but they are not equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives. 
  The sentence at lines 28–31 represents a particular opinion on the level of advocacy that lawyers should provide in certain situations, while the earlier statements present a more general perspective.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as disagreement over the particulars. 
  The answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the role of defense lawyers and their obligation to both the defendant and the court/society.
  Lines 7-11 present a view that the defense lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, without judging the defendant's guilt or innocence.
  Lines 28-31 state that defense lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their guilty clients' innocence.
Thought: 
  Lines 28-31 are discussing the duty of defense lawyers in cases where they are convinced that their clients are guilty.
  They contradict the view presented in lines 7-11 that defense lawyers should provide the best defense regardless of their personal beliefs.
  Therefore, the relationship is one of disagreement.
  The answer is B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct, and the answer is B.
  Just to clarify, the opinion presented in lines 7-11 is one view of the role of defense lawyers, but the author ultimately disagrees with it and presents a different view later on. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses whether defense lawyers are required to believe that their clients are innocent. Some scholars argue that lawyers are obligated to provide the best possible defense regardless of their personal opinions about the client's guilt or innocence. Others argue that lawyers have a twofold obligation to their clients and to society, and that they should not present false or insincere information to the court. Instead, they should present the case in their client's favor based on the evidence, and argue for an appropriate degree of leniency in sentencing.
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence, but should instead argue for leniency in sentencing based on any extenuating circumstances. This information is related to the discussion in the earlier lines, because it further explains the twofold obligation that defense lawyers have to their clients and to society. It also reinforces the idea that lawyers should not present false or insincere information to the court, but should instead present the case in their client's favor based on the evidence.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 and the sentence at lines 7-11 can be described as "reinforcement" or "elaboration."
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism: 
  None.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the obligations and responsibilities of defense lawyers.
- The author argues that defense lawyers have a duty to their clients, the court, and society, and that they should not present assertions that they know to be false.
- The author also argues that lawyers should appraise the case in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.
Thought:
- The sentences at lines 28-31 state that defense lawyers should try to prove their clients' innocence if they sincerely believe their clients may well be innocent.
- This is directly relevant to the earlier statement that lawyers' obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of.
- The sentences at lines 28-31 elaborate on how lawyers should go about providing the best defense, depending on whether they believe their clients are guilty or innocent.
- Therefore, the relationship between the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 and the sentence at lines 7-11 is that the former provides additional detail on how lawyers should fulfill their obligation to provide the best defense.
- The author's position on defense lawyers' obligations is consistent throughout the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligations of defense lawyers in representing their clients.
  The passage acknowledges that lawyers have an obligation to their clients, the court, and society.
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that lawyers should not take cases that they cannot provide an earnest defense for.
  The earlier lines state that defense lawyers have an obligation to provide the best defense they are capable of for their clients.
  The two sentences are in agreement that lawyers have an obligation both to their clients and to society, but they disagree over how that obligation should be carried out.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 acknowledges that providing a defense is not the same as presenting a false defense.
  The earlier lines suggest that the obligation to provide the best defense includes putting forth the best arguments possible, whether or not they are based on the truth of the matter.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 to that in the sentence at lines 7-11 is that they are essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the facts, logic, or reasoning of the answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the obligations of defense lawyers to their clients, the court, and society.
  The author argues that defense lawyers should not present assertions that they know to be false, but should advocate for their clients within the bounds of ethical and legal obligations.
  The author suggests that defense lawyers are obligated to provide the best defense they are capable of, but this does not require them to believe their clients are innocent.
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their clients' innocence when they are convinced of their guilt.
  This suggests that the obligation of defense lawyers to provide the best defense they are capable of does not require them to believe their clients are innocent.
  This is in line with the author's earlier discussion about the ethical and legal obligations of defense lawyers.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information in the two sentences at lines 28-31 to that in the sentence at lines 7-11 is that they support and expand on the author's earlier arguments about the obligations of defense lawyers.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligations of defense lawyers.
  Legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of.
  According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate.
  However, the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court and, by extension, to society.
Thought: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 state that guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation and that lawyers who know with certainty that a defendant is guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  The sentences at lines 7-11 state that some legal scholars believe that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, and that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 oppose the scholars' belief that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they can.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 clarify that a lawyer's obligation is not just to the defendant, but also to the court and to society.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 to that in the sentence at lines 7-11 can most accurately be described as: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines.
  The answer is B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines.
Criticism: 
  There is no hypothetical situation in the sentences at lines 28-31, so choice C is not correct.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 do not agree with the earlier position, so choice D is not correct.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 and the sentence at lines 7-11 are not essentially equivalent, so choice E is not correct.
  Therefore, the answer is B as originally determined.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients, the court, and society, and whether they need to believe their clients are innocent.
  Lines 7-11: Some scholars argue that lawyers' obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of and not to judge their clients.
  Lines 28-31: Lawyers should not represent clients they know are guilty and should instead present extenuating circumstances and argue for leniency in sentencing.
Thought: 
  Lines 7-11 argue that lawyers' obligation is to provide the best defense they can without judging their clients.
  Lines 28-31 argue that if lawyers know their clients are guilty, they should not try to prove their innocence but should instead argue for leniency in sentencing.
  The two sentences at lines 28-31 are discussing a specific situation that contradicts the general argument made in lines 7-11.
  Therefore, the relationship can be described as disagreement over the particulars.
  The answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to provide the best defense possible for their clients while also being truthful to the court and society.
  Lines 7-11 explain that while some scholars believe that lawyers have no right to judge defendants, the lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant and the court/society.
  Lines 28-31 explain that every client is entitled to a defense, but defense lawyers should not take every case they are offered. Instead, they should be advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Thought: 
  Lines 7-11 describe the obligation of defense lawyers to provide the best defense possible while being truthful to the court and society. 
  Lines 28-31 describe the obligation of defense lawyers to be advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case. 
  These statements seem to be making similar points about the role of defense lawyers.
  Therefore, the relationship between these two sentences can be described as E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism: 
  There is no disagreement or hypothetical situation mentioned in either of the described sentences. 
  The relationship is not that one sentence is opposing the other or stating agreement with a disagreement over particulars.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: In what other areas besides Europe did Spanish-language proverbs currently used in Mexican American communities originate?
  B: Are any proverbs that are used frequently in the English-language tradition derived from Mexican American proverbs?

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception
  D: questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence
  E: countering a revolutionary hypothesis
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")

The passage discusses the misconception that wine is just like every other alcoholic beverage. The author discusses the research conducted by a small group of researchers that investigates the effects of moderate wine consumption. The research seems to show that moderate wine consumption has a positive effect on the body, specifically the heart. The passage goes on to describe how wine consumption decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, reduce platelet adhesiveness, and increases the activity of natural clot-breaking compounds. The author’s main objective is to correct the scientific misconception that wine is just like every other alcoholic beverage. Therefore, the correct answer is C: correcting a scientific misconception.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")

The author is concerned with correcting a scientific misconception that most scientists had assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol and have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. The author argues that wine has healthful effects, which these scientists have obscured as they study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages. The author goes on to explain that recent research has shown a link between moderate wine consumption and a decrease in deaths due to premature heart disease. Therefore, the correct answer is C: correcting a scientific misconception.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")

The author is primarily concerned with correcting a scientific misconception. The passage discusses how scientists have traditionally assumed that the only active ingredient in alcoholic beverages is alcohol and have not investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. The author argues that moderate wine consumption can have healthful effects that have been obscured by this assumption. The passage then goes on to discuss research that has investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption and has found evidence of the healthful effects of wine, including its effects on lipid processing, endothelial cell reactivity, and platelet adhesiveness. Overall, the passage is focused on correcting a misconception among scientists about the health effects of wine and advocating for more research in this area. Therefore, the correct answer is C: correcting a scientific misconception.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")

The primary concern of the author is to correct a specific scientific misconception about the physiological effects of wine by presenting evidence gathered by researchers who have investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption and questioned the assumption of many scientists that the only active ingredient in wine is alcohol. The author makes clear that other alcoholic beverages have been thoroughly studied, but wine—despite its purported healthful effects—has not been studied to the same extent, leading to an incomplete understanding of the physiological effects of wine. Therefore, the best answer is C: correcting a scientific misconception.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")

The passage discusses how scientists have previously assumed that wine's only active ingredient is alcohol and have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. The primary concern of the author is to correct this scientific misconception and to show how wine has healthful effects that have been obscured by the lack of distinction made by these scientists. Therefore, the correct answer is C: correcting a scientific misconception.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology as a fundamentally different kind of enterprise.
  FMRI stands for functional magnetic resonance imaging and is a research method.
  FMRI is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  What FMRI scans of brain activity typically depict is the differential rate of oxygen use.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are typically interpreted as a map of the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The process of obtaining this map involves taking a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task, and then subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
  Whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The passage asks whether the modular theory of mind is ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method.
  We are asked which of the answer choices is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  The correct answer choice should describe a process of subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during some other condition to obtain information about the effects of that condition.
  A: This answer choice does not involve the subtraction of a baseline measurement from another measurement.
  B: This answer choice describes the effects of an advertising campaign on shoppers during the summer, but it does not involve the subtraction of a baseline measurement from another measurement.
  C: This answer choice does not involve the subtraction of a baseline measurement from another measurement.
  D: This answer choice does not involve the subtraction of a baseline measurement from another measurement.
  E: This answer choice describes the running speed of cheetahs over long distances compared to other land animals, but it does not involve the subtraction of a baseline measurement from another measurement.
  None of the answer choices are a good match for the process of interpreting FMRI scans of brain activity.
Criticism: 
  Although the passage describes the process of subtracting a baseline measurement from another measurement to obtain information about the effects of a condition, none of the answer choices describe a similar process.
  The question may be flawed or incomplete.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The passage explains how FMRI scans are typically interpreted.
- The interpretation involves taking a baseline measurement and then subtracting it from a measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task.
- The resulting image is taken to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
Thought:
- The scan is interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
- This is similar to subtracting one quantity from another to determine the amount attributable to a particular factor.
- Of the choices, the most analogous is (C) Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
- This is because, just as the FMRI interpretation method involves subtracting out a baseline to determine the activity associated with the cognitive task, the impact of droughts on the agricultural sector is determined by subtracting out the amount of water used by the residential sector.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology research and critiques the modular theory of mind, which suggests that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules instantiated in localized brain regions. 
  The passage also explains how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans work. FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity, but actually depict the differential rate of oxygen use. 
Thought: 
  The FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement, so the resulting image represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. 
  Analogously, one can interpret "the store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers." 
  This interpretation is similar to the subtractive method used to interpret FMRI scans because both involve isolating the effect of a specific variable by subtracting a control condition. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Criticism: 
  The analogy is not perfect, as the passage does not discuss the effects of a specific variable. Instead, it critiques the modular theory of mind and explains how FMRI scans work. 
  However, the analogy is still reasonable because both the interpretation of FMRI scans and the increase in shoppers during the summer involve isolating an effect by subtracting a control condition. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology.
  The passage explains that the validity of using brain scans to identify distinct regions of the brain associated with particular mental activities depends on the modular theory of mind, which assumes that mental activity can be decomposed into separable modules.
  The passage argues that the modular theory of mind may not be valid, and that instead of distinct modules, mental processes are likely to be distributed throughout the brain.
  The passage explains that the way FMRI scans are typically interpreted involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task, and then interpreting the resulting image as a map of the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
Thought: 
  The question asks for an analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage.
  According to the passage, the interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting out the baseline metabolic activity from the metabolic activity during a cognitive task, and interpreting the remainder as being associated solely with the cognitive task.
  An analogy to this might be a situation where one wants to determine how much of a particular type of food people are eating at a restaurant, and so one measures the weight of all the food being served during the day, and then subtracts the weight of all the dishes that do not contain the particular type of food in order to estimate the weight of the food being consumed.
  Choice A is not a good analogy because it describes a situation where one electoral district is particularly important, whereas the interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting out a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during a cognitive task in order to estimate the metabolic activity associated solely with the task.
  Choice B is not a good analogy because it describes a situation where an advertising campaign had an effect only during a particular season, whereas the interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting out a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during a cognitive task in order to estimate the metabolic activity associated solely with the task.
  Choice C is not a good analogy because it describes a situation where the agricultural sector is impacted most severely during droughts, whereas the interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting out a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during a cognitive task in order to estimate the metabolic activity associated solely with the task.
  Choice D is not a good analogy because it describes a situation where most Internet traffic during peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings, whereas the interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting out a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during a cognitive task in order to estimate the metabolic activity associated solely with the task.
  Choice E is not a good analogy because it describes a situation where cheetahs are the fastest land animal only for short distances, whereas the interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting out a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during a cognitive task in order to estimate the metabolic activity associated solely with the task.
Conclusion: 
  None of the choices are a good analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage. However, the closest analogy is probably Choice A, since it involves identifying one particular factor that is crucial to a particular outcome. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the use of FMRI scans in psychology research and the modular theory of mind.
  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  What actually appears in the scan is the differential rate of oxygen use: a baseline measurement in the control condition is subtracted from a measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  One potential problem with this method is that it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Thought:
  FMRI scans are interpreted by taking a baseline measurement in the control condition and subtracting it from a measurement while the subject is performing a cognitive task to see what remains.
  This method assumes that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  However, the entire brain is active in both conditions, so this method may obscure more than it reveals.
  The question is asking us to select the option that is most analogous to the way FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Option B is similar in that it makes an assumption based on a correlation between two things (advertisements and summer shoppers), without accounting for other factors that may be affecting the outcome.
  Option A is not very similar since it is discussing a specific district that had a large impact on an election, rather than a method of interpretation.
  Option C is not very similar either since it is discussing a comparison between two different customers of a water supply, rather than a method of interpretation.
  Option D is somewhat similar since it makes an assumption about where Internet traffic originates based on when it is highest, but it does not involve a subtraction or an assumption about what remains after the subtraction.
  Option E is not very similar since it is discussing the limitations of cheetahs in running long distances.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. 
Criticism: 
  Option B is a good analogy because it also involves assuming that one thing (the advertising campaign) caused a change in another thing (the number of shoppers), although other factors may have been involved. However, it is not a perfect analogy since it does not involve a subtraction or an assumption about what remains after the subtraction, as in the case of FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of interpreting FMRI brain scans.
  The scans are a result of a subtraction method that subtracts a baseline measurement from a measurement of a cognitive task.
  The resulting image is interpreted as revealing the area of the brain associated solely with the cognitive task.
Thought: 
  The method of interpreting FMRI scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement of a cognitive task.
  This creates an image that highlights the differential rate of oxygen use and obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, a real impression of neat functional localization is given through differential brain scans that subtract the distributed brain functions.
  This is analogous to choice B where the store's advertisements had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the store's advertisements affected only summer shoppers.
  Just as the advertisements affect only the summer shoppers, the FMRI scan affects only the specific area of the brain associated with the cognitive task.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging to study the brain.
  Specifically, it focuses on the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity.
  FMRI scans show changes in metabolic activity in response to cognitive tasks.
  The scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement, to isolate the activity associated solely with the task.
Thought: 
  The passage states that FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement to isolate activity associated solely with the task. 
  This is similar to subtracting the amount of activity occurring in a control condition from the amount of activity occurring in an experimental condition.
  Therefore, the answer is A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
Criticism: 
  Option A describes a situation where one particular district was critical for determining the outcome of an election.
  This situation is not analogous to the way in which FMRI scans are typically interpreted.
  Options B, C, D, and E all describe situations where a particular factor is believed (or not believed) to have an impact on a larger phenomenon.
  While these options all describe a relationship between two variables, none are directly analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging, specifically the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to examine brain activity in cognitive tasks.
  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  However, what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use between a baseline measurement in the control condition and a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
Thought:
  FMRI scans depict a differential rate of oxygen use between a control condition and a cognitive task.
  The scan is interpreted as showing the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  However, the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The method for interpreting FMRI scans obscures the fact that all brain functions are distributed.
  So, the manner in which FMRI scans are typically interpreted is most analogous to:
    A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
    B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
    C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
    D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
    E: The cheetah is the world's fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
  Choice (B) is the most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans are typically interpreted, as both involve a differential effect being attributed to a specific condition (advertising campaign or cognitive task) while obscuring the fact that there are other contributing factors that have not been subtracted out (other shoppers or other brain functions).
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans of brain activity work.
  FMRI scans are used to reveal areas of the brain that are active during cognitive tasks.
  The FMRI method involves taking a baseline measurement of brain activity and then taking a second measurement while the subject is performing the cognitive task.
  The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement to reveal the areas that are active only during the task.
Thought:
  The FMRI method involves subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to reveal the areas that are active only during the task.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  However, the differential brain scans produced by this method are often used to support the modular theory of mind.
  Therefore, the most analogous situation to this method is one in which a particular measurement is taken in two different conditions and the difference between the two is used to determine something specific to one of the conditions.
  Option A is not analogous because the large margin in one district may not be the only reason the mayor won.
  Option B is not analogous because the advertisements may have had an effect on non-summer shoppers as well.
  Option C is not analogous because even though more water may be used by agricultural customers, both sectors are impacted when there is a drought.
  Option D is not analogous because the fact that most Internet traffic originates in homes during peak hours does not necessarily mean that most traffic overall originates in homes.
  Option E is not analogous because being the fastest land animal for short distances does not necessarily mean that cheetahs cannot outrun other land animals over long distances.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
 FMRI scans are used in psychology research as a way to see which parts of the brain "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks.
 The FMRI scan is typically interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
 The differential rate of oxygen use is used to determine the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
 The subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Thought:
 FMRI scans are interpreted through a subtractive method.
 This method subtracts a baseline measurement from a measurement while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
 The result is interpreted as the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
 The entire brain is active in both conditions, but the subtractive method obscures this fact.
 A similar analogy would be an interpretation that isolates one particular aspect of a larger system and attributes all changes or differences solely to that aspect.
 The analogy that best fits in this description is option B, A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Criticism:
 The choice of analogy may be debated.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education and objections to each of them.
  The second proposal holds that multicultural education should adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and should examine cultures through the methods of Western science.
  Critics of this second proposal argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
Thought:
  Critics of the second proposal argue that the methods of Western science are already value-laden and that adopting them to understand non-scientific cultures is distorting and an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  The objection they raise is that it is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  The answer that best reflects this objection is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education: one that promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures through the perspectives of the majority culture, and another that advocates for a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still relies on Western social-scientific methods. 
  The second version of multicultural education is criticized by some as not being different from the first, as it still relies on a Western scientific perspective that is value-laden and distorts the understanding of non-Western cultures.
Thought: 
  The objection raised by the critics of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first, as it relies on Western social-scientific methods that are value-laden and distorting when applied to non-Western cultures.
  None of the answer choices fully captures this objection.
  Answer choice A suggests a cultural relativist position that would oppose the argument made by the critics of the second version of multicultural education, as it would hold that members of a culture with different values cannot understand the social and historical circumstances that give rise to another culture's values.
  Answer choice B acknowledges that historical and social circumstances can play a role in shaping a culture's values, but does not address the criticism raised by the critics of the second version of multicultural education.
  Answer choice C suggests a multi-perspectival approach to studying other cultures, which is not directly related to the objection raised by the critics of the second version of multicultural education.
  Answer choice D suggests a cultural essentialist position that would oppose the argument made by the critics of the second version of multicultural education, as it would hold that genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  Answer choice E suggests that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood through the methods of Western science, which is somewhat related to the criticism raised by the critics of the second version of multicultural education, but is not a direct or complete response to it.
  None of the answer choices can be selected as the best answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Educators advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding.
  There are different proposals on what multicultural education should consist of.
  The first proposal advocates that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture.
  The second proposal holds multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective.
  The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are viewed by critics of the second proposal as already value-laden.
Thought: 
  The objection discussed in the second paragraph claims that the Western scientific heritage underpinning the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures is already value-laden.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded on an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  Western scientific discourse is different from the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight often used in non-Western cultures.
  To truly understand non-Western cultures, we should use the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  From this, critics would most likely agree with option E that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")

Thought:
  The critics of the second proposal argue that Western scientific methods are value-laden and cannot adequately capture non-Western cultures.
  They believe that to truly understand another culture, we must adopt the non-scientific perspectives and methods of that culture.
  Therefore, they would most likely agree with the idea that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  Option B is the best fit for this perspective.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses different proposals for multicultural education.
  The second version of multicultural education involves adopting a neutral stance towards value differences among cultures and using Western methods to study them.
  Critics of this approach argue that Western scientific methods are value-laden and that it is better to understand other cultures by adopting their own perspectives and methods.
Thought:
  The critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph argue that Western scientific methods are value-laden.
  They believe that trying to understand non-Western cultures using Western methods distorts and Eurocentrically maintains cultural chauvinism.
  So, they would be most likely to agree that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, including primary and secondary substances.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances may have arisen by genetic mutation and natural selection.
  Insects play a major role in the presence of secondary substances in plants.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is that the distinctive tastes and smells of plants are largely due to an evolutionary interaction between the plants and insects.
  This interaction has resulted in a diversity of secondary substances, some of which act as defenses against insect damage.
  Insects have evolved ways to circumvent plant defenses, leading to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and a corresponding narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention in the passage that narrowing of secondary substances range has led to a narrowing of insect species range.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")

The passage discusses how the chemical composition of plants determines their distinctive smells and tastes. It describes how secondary substances in plants, which have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism, give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects have played a major role in the development of secondary substances due to evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects. The passage supports the idea that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. Thus, the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage is choice C: "The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects."
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explores the chemical composition of different types of plants, including primary and secondary substances.
  Secondary substances give plants their taste and smell.
  Insects have played a major role in the evolution of secondary substances in plants.
  Some secondary substances have developed due to genetic mutations and natural selection.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is to explain the relationship between plants and insects in the evolution of secondary substances.
  The passage discusses how secondary substances serve as natural defenses against insects.
  The author also notes that secondary substances have evolved through genetic mutations and natural selection.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")

The passage discusses the formation of the secondary substances in plants, and how the presence of such substances is usually due to genetic mutations in plants. The substances are of two types: those that attract pollinating insects to allow for cross-pollination and those that protect plants from being consumed by plant-eating insects. Some substances can deter insects from feeding by warning them of the presence of something harmful, while others can actually cause unpleasant symptoms or even death to insects. The passage goes on to explain that over time, plants and insects have co-evolved and developed specific tastes and smells. Because of this long-term interaction, the secondary substances in plants tend to be similar among closely related species. So, the best answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The passage discusses secondary substances in plants which give plants distinctive tastes and smells. Insects play a major role in the development of these secondary substances and the evolution of plants. These substances and the evolution of plants happen due to competition between plants and insects. The narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants is also discussed. Hence, the main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. This idea is best expressed in option C. Therefore, the answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, including primary and secondary substances.

B: This statement accurately describes the narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and the narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage.
C: This statement accurately describes the evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects that gives rise to distinctive tastes and smells of plants, and it best captures the main point of the passage.
D: This statement accurately describes the diversity of secondary substances in plants and their similarity among closely related species, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage.
E: This statement accurately describes the process of competition between plants and plant-eating insects, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage.
Thought:
The main point of the passage is to describe the role of secondary substances in plants and their evolutionary relationship with plant-eating insects.
Choice C accurately captures the main point of the passage, as it describes how the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants result from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")

The main point of the passage is about the relationship between plants and insects, particularly regarding secondary substances, which give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. The passage describes how insects have played a major role in the development of these substances, both as scents that attract pollinating insects and as biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects. This has led to an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects, resulting in the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants and their distinctive tastes and smells. Therefore, the most accurate expression of the main point is given in choice C: "The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects."
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about the chemical composition of plants and how it relates to their taste and smell.
  Plants contain primary and secondary substances.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are diverse and have no known role in internal chemical processes, and they give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances arose from genetic mutations in individual plants but must pass natural selection to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations.
  Secondary substances can serve as biochemical defenses against insects or can attract pollinating insects to blossoms.
Thought:
  The passage talks about the chemical composition of plants and how it relates to their taste and smell.
  Secondary substances are key to giving plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances are a result of evolutionary processes and interactions between plants and insects.
  The competition between plants and insects has led to the evolution of secondary substances that can serve as defenses against insects or attract pollinating insects to blossoms.
  Thus, it can be concluded that the main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
  The answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Criticism:
  The answer accurately reflects the main point of the passage. No flaws were identified.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins
  B: endorse a claim simply because it is widely believed
  C: accept a claim for the sake of argument
  D: attempt to resolve an apparent paradox
  E: assert that their positions are supported by data
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The authors of passage A and passage B are arguing for different explanations for the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  A: The author of passage A argues that people compare their income to a norm, which increases with actual income. They also argue that people are pushed by habituation and rivalry to invest in material possessions. 
  B: The author of passage B argues that relative prosperity and a sense of success create happiness, rather than money itself. They also argue that a desire to create value is not ignoble.
Thought: 
  The authors of both passages are presenting their own arguments and evidence to explain the relationship between wealth and happiness. They are not just accepting claims for the sake of argument nor basing their arguments solely on popular belief. Both authors also use data and argue for their explanations to resolve an apparent paradox (that richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people, but over time, advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer).
Therefore, the correct answer is E: assert that their positions are supported by data.
Criticism: None.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials
  C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial
  D: theorize that stealing thunder is best done as early as possible in a case, before the opposition has an opportunity to solidify jurors' opinions
  E: speculate that creating credibility in some cases is probably more effective than positively framing very harmful information
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) and its importance.

Thought:
- The author discusses how early information, through its creation of a cognitive framework, can influence jurors' evaluation of information presented later in the trial.
- This suggests that choice A, which focuses on the influence of early information on jurors, is the correct answer.
- The other choices touch on other aspects of the text, but do not specifically address the cognitive framework and its impact on jurors' evaluation of trial information, as choice A does.
- Therefore, the best answer is A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.

Criticism:
- None.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses stealing thunder as a courtroom strategy for revealing negative information about a client before it can be used against them in court. 
  Psychological research supports the idea that revealing damaging information early can create an image of credibility and can also provide jurors with an impetus for critical assessment, making them more resistant to persuasion. 
Thought: 
  The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create primarily to explain how jurors are likely to filter subsequent information through an early negative impression, making it more difficult to persuade them later in the trial.

Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the strategy of "stealing thunder" in courtrooms. It is a strategy of revealing negative information about a client before the opposition is able to bring it up in a way that is damaging. It is believed to work because it can create credibility and because juries are more resistant to persuasion when they are warned ahead of time. Stealing thunder can only be effective when the negative information can be framed positively, as jurors will use this framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. 
Thought: The question asks about the author's discussion of "cognitive framework" that jurors create. The passage discusses how jurors can form a cognitive framework based on information presented early in the trial, which can then influence how they evaluate information presented later. This indicates that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

It suggests that people may not be making free and rational moral choices because their brains dictate their behavior, and that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution.
  Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will. It argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, and that the brain's role determines whether an action is free.
Thought: 
  Passage A proposes that the law should abandon retribution and focus on deterring future harms, while Passage B argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. These ideas are not directly related, so it is difficult to say if one passage is more engaged, dismissive, detached, ironic, or skeptical than the other.
Criticism: 
  The question asks for the attitude displayed in Passage B, but it does not offer a clear comparison to Passage A. Additionally, neither passage displays a clear attitude towards the ideas presented, so it is difficult to choose an answer here.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss the relationship between neuroscience and the concept of free will.
  A suggests that neuroscience findings show that we should abandon retribution as a justification for punishment in favor of focusing on deterring future harms.
  B presents a theory of soft determinism and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought: 
  The question asks how Passage B differs from Passage A with respect to the attitude it displays.
  Passage A expresses a viewpoint and suggests a change in the law based on recent neuroscience findings.
  Passage B presents a theory of soft determinism and argues that free actions are those that are not constrained.
  While Passage A suggests a change in the law, Passage B does not make specific recommendations.
  Therefore, Passage B is more detached in its attitude than Passage A.
  The answer is C: detached.
Criticism: 
  There is no clear indication in Passage B that it is more detached than Passage A.
  The two passages have different topics and different arguments, so it is difficult to compare their attitudes.
  It's also possible that one could argue that Passage B is more engaged or skeptical than Passage A.
  The question could be considered unclear or ambiguous.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that neuroscience suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution and instead focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the idea of free will and determinism and argues for a theory of "soft determinism".
Thought:
  Passage B differs from passage A in that it discusses a different topic altogether.
  Passage B discusses the idea of free will while passage A discusses the implications of neuroscience on the criminal-justice system.
  There is no indication in passage B that the author is engaged, dismissive, detached, ironic, or skeptical toward the ideas it discusses.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that neuroscientific findings suggest that the law should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing bad people.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and argues that a person can still act freely in a deterministic world.
Thought: 
  Passage A is focused on the implications of neuroscientific findings for the law and makes a specific argument about the need to focus on deterrence rather than retribution. 
  Passage B discusses a philosophical concept (free will) and presents a theory (soft determinism) that seeks to reconcile determinism with the possibility of free action.
  The tone of Passage A is practical and policy-oriented, while the tone of Passage B is philosophical and theoretical.
  Passage B does not engage with the specific arguments made in Passage A.
  Therefore, the attitude displayed toward the ideas discussed in Passage B is more detached, while Passage A is more engaged.
  The answer is A: engaged.
Criticism: 
  The question asks about the attitude displayed toward the ideas discussed in each passage, but the knowledge provided only describes the content of each passage and the main arguments they make. 
  While it is true that Passage A is more focused on practical implications and makes a specific argument about the law, and Passage B is more theoretical and discusses a broader concept (free will), it is not clear that the tone of one passage is more engaged or dismissive than the other.
  Therefore, a different answer could be justified.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the radical changes brought by neuroscience in the way we think about the law, suggesting that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution. 
  Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will and how actions are defined as free or constrained based on internal or external sources of the cause.
Thought: 
  Passage A focuses on the impact of neuroscience on the criminal-justice system, suggesting how the system should change in light of the new findings. The author appears to be more engaged with the topic and advocates for a specific change in the system. 
  Passage B discusses a philosophical idea, and although it does not explicitly discuss neuroscience, it could be seen as a response to the deterministic view of behavior that neuroscience supports. The author appears to be more detached and philosophical. 
  Therefore, Passage A is more engaged, while Passage B is more detached.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A concerns how new findings in neuroscience change the way we view the law. 
  It argues that free will is an illusion and, as a result, the criminal-justice system should focus more on deterrence rather than retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will as it relates to determinism. 
  It argues that free will and determinism can coexist if one defines "free actions" as those caused by internal sources rather than external ones.
Thought:
  Passage A argues for a deterministic view of the law and claims that free will is an illusion.
  Passage B argues that free will and determinism can coexist.
  The tone of passage B is more measured and analytical than that of passage A.
  It does not dismiss the argument in passage A but rather provides an alternative perspective.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how neuroscience changes the way we think about the law, arguing that retribution should be abandoned as a justification for punishment and instead the law should focus on deterring future harms. 
  Passage B discusses free will and determinism, and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought: 
  Passage A focuses on the implications of neuroscience for the law, and takes a specific stance on what those implications should be. The author is engaged with the ideas presented and argues for a particular course of action. 
  Passage B discusses a different topic, the relationship between free will and determinism, and presents a view on the topic that is not necessarily related to the law. The author argues for a particular view of free will, but does not engage with other arguments or ideas in the same way that Passage A does.
  Based on this, Passage B is more detached than Passage A.
Criticism: 
  The question asks about the attitude of the author in Passage B, not about the content of the passage itself. While it is true that Passage B is more detached than Passage A, it is possible that the author of Passage B still has a skeptical or dismissive attitude toward the ideas discussed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses changes in the way the law should think about punishment due to neuroscience findings.
  Passage B discusses the concept of soft determinism and how it allows for the possibility of free will even in a deterministic world.
Thought: 
  Passage A views neuroscience findings as radical changes that should result in a shift away from retribution as the primary justification of punishment. 
  In contrast, Passage B discusses a philosophical concept that allows for free will even in a deterministic world, but it does not dismiss or engage with the neuroscience findings in the same way as Passage A.
  Therefore, Passage B is more detached from the neuroscience findings than Passage A.
  The answer is C: detached.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. 
  However, it's worth noting that while Passage B does not engage or dismiss the neuroscience findings, it does offer a different perspective on free will that could be seen as related to the topic.
  Therefore, there is room to argue that Passage B is also somewhat skeptical of the neuroscience findings.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the law should abandon retribution and focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses how free will can be compatible with determinism.
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B discuss different aspects of the law.
  Passage A focuses on how recent findings in neuroscience should change the way we think about the law.
  Passage B discusses how free will can exist in a deterministic world.
  There is no indication that Passage B displays any attitude toward the ideas it discusses.
  Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: detached.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between neuroscience and free will and their implications for the law.
  A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that free will is an illusion and that the criminal justice system should focus on deterrence rather than retribution.
  B argues that determinism and free will can coexist, and that actions can be considered free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought:
  The question asks how Passage B differs from Passage A in terms of attitude. 
  Passage A appears to take a more skeptical and critical attitude toward the idea of free will, suggesting that it may be an illusion and that the law should focus on deterrence rather than retribution. 
  Passage B takes a more engaged attitude toward the idea of free will, arguing that it can coexist with determinism and providing a theory of "soft determinism" to explain how this is possible.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: engaged.
Criticism:
  The question could be interpreted in different ways, and it is possible that another answer choice could also be correct depending on how the reader interprets the attitudes in each passage.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the attitude of Matthew Arnold toward the aristocratic and middle classes can best be described as one of
Choices:
  A: respect
  B: empathy
  C: indifference
  D: disappointment
  E: scorn

Thought: 
  The passage states that "In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability."
  This suggests that Arnold had a negative view of both classes and their culture.
  The answer is D: disappointment or E: scorn.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state whether Arnold's attitude is one of disappointment or scorn.
  It is possible that Arnold's attitude could be interpreted as indifference rather than negativity.
  However, given the harshness of Arnold's language in describing both classes, it seems more likely that the answer is either D or E.
Action: Answer("E")

  The best answer is E: scorn.
Criticism:
  The passage suggests that Arnold had negative views towards the aristocracy and the middle class, but it does not explicitly state that he had a feeling of contempt or disdain towards them.
  It is possible that Arnold had a different attitude towards them, such as disappointment or disgust.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Matthew Arnold's characterization of the aristocracy and middle class in nineteenth-century England.
Thought:
  According to the passage, Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability.
  The passage does not indicate that Arnold viewed either class with respect or empathy.
  It also does not suggest that Arnold was indifferent to the attitudes of either class.
  Rather, the passage indicates that Arnold's characterization of the two classes was critical and negative.
  The term "Barbarians" suggests scorn or disdain, and the term "Philistines" similarly implies disappointment or disapproval.
  Therefore, the attitude of Matthew Arnold toward the aristocratic and middle classes can best be described as one of Scorn.
  The answer is E: Scorn.
Action: Answer("E")

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education and their criticisms. 
  The first version proposes that students learn about other cultures within the context of the majority culture's values. 
  The second version proposes a neutral stance towards value differences, but still adopts Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it uses Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures, which may not be appropriate. 
  To provide a strong objection to this criticism, we would need to show that it is possible to understand non-Western cultures through Western scientific methods.
  Choice A does not provide a strong objection since it suggests that this is impossible. 
  Choice B is irrelevant to the criticism. 
  Choice C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when examining other cultures, but this does not address the criticism about the use of Western scientific methods. 
  Choice D is also irrelevant since it discusses understanding Western culture, not non-Western cultures. 
  Choice E is also irrelevant since it is a general statement about understanding cultures, but does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. 
  None of the choices provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Criticism: None of the choices provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education: one that examines other cultures through the methods of the majority culture, and one that attempts to be neutral in its approach to value differences among cultures by using social-scientific methods, but is still seen by critics as being influenced by Western cultural values.
Thought: The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that social-scientific methods are inherently value-laden and Western in nature, which prevents genuine understanding of non-Western cultures. Therefore, the strongest objection would provide evidence that these methods are not inherently value-laden, or that a non-Western approach can provide genuine understanding of other cultures.
A: This statement is true, but it does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
B: This statement is also true, but it does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
C: This statement acknowledges that some non-Western societies may use their own value system when studying other cultures, but it does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
D: This statement is not relevant to the discussion of multicultural education.
E: This statement reinforces the idea that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary, but it does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Criticism: There is no option that provides evidence that social-scientific methods are not inherently value-laden or that a non-Western approach can provide genuine understanding of other cultures.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education that have been proposed.
  The first version promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture and its liberal values.
  The second version proposes that each culture should be taken on its own terms, without the Western scientific perspective distorting it.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first, as it still employs Western scientific methods and perspectives.
  To provide a strong objection, we need to find a statement that counters this criticism.
  Option A is not relevant because the passage did not suggest that adopting a culture's perspectives and methods requires becoming a member of that culture.
  Option B is also not relevant, because even if some value systems are similar, the objection is that the Western scientific method is not an appropriate lens to view other cultures.
  Option C does not provide a strong objection because it simply asserts that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures, but it does not address the criticism that Western scientific methods are still used.
  Option D is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of intercultural understanding.
  Option E is a restatement of the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, rather than a counterargument.
  Therefore, none of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposes teaching about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture.
  The second proposes adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and using Western scientific methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures.
  Critics argue that both proposals are flawed. The first is criticized for refracting the study of other cultures through the perspective of the majority culture. The second is criticized for being value-laden and not being essentially different from the first.
Thought: 
  The question asks for the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  The criticism is that Western scientific methods of examination of cultures are value-laden and involve a commitment to certain values, such as objectivity, that are prized in Western cultures. Therefore, using these methods to understand non-Western cultures is distorting and an expression of maintaining a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  The strongest objection to this criticism would be a statement that shows Western scientific methods of examination of cultures are not value-laden or that can be used to understand non-Western cultures without being distorting or evidence of cultural chauvinism.
  Option A is incorrect because it affirms the criticism that a member of a culture is needed to adopt its perspectives and methods. 
  Option B is incorrect because while some non-Western societies may share similar value systems, it doesn't address the criticism of the Western perspective still being imposed in understanding those cultures.
  Option C is incorrect because it is a variation of the first version of multicultural education, which the criticism already addressed.
  Option D is incorrect because it is irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. This option is merely stating that adequate appreciation requires genuine understanding of another culture. It does not address the criticism of the Western perspective being imposed in understanding those cultures.
Criticism: 
  N/A
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The second version seeks to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden because they derive from a Western scientific perspective and heritage.
Thoughts:
  The objection to the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first version.
  The objection is based on the argument that social-scientific methods are already value-laden.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to this criticism would be an argument that the second version of multicultural education is essentially different from the first version.
  Option E seems to provide such an argument by stating that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Criticism:
  Option E suggests that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary, but it does not necessarily follow that the second version of multicultural education is essentially different from the first version.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal claims that students should learn about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's methods, perspectives, and values.
  The second proposal claims that students should adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures adopted in this version are still identifiably Western.
  Critics argue that both proposals are flawed because they involve a commitment to certain values that do not belong to the culture being studied and thus distort its understanding.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures is not enough because the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures adopted in this version are still identifiably Western, and this problem is not solved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied. 
  To object to this criticism, we need to show that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is a solution to this problem.
  A: This choice does not provide a solution to the problem because it claims that adopting the perspectives and methods of a culture is impossible.
  B: This choice is not relevant to the problem.
  C: This choice suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying other cultures, but this does not show that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied solves the problem.
  D: This choice discusses another issue and does not provide a solution to the problem.
  E: This choice does not provide a solution to the problem.
  None of the above choices provides a solution to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. 
Criticism:
  There is no option that provides a strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version promotes multicultural understanding through teaching other cultures within the context of the majority culture's perspectives.
  The second version advocates for adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still applies Western methods for examination, study, and explanation of other cultures.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education argues that trying to understand non-Western cultures through Western scientific methods is not only distorting but also demonstrates an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  The objection is based on the idea that Western scientific methods are value-laden, and therefore, the second version of multicultural education is essentially the same as the first.
  To provide the strongest objection, we need to show that it is possible to study and understand other cultures through Western scientific methods without distorting or imposing Western values.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the objection.
  Choice B does not address the issue of Western scientific methods and value-laden perspectives.
  Choice C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying other cultures. Still, it does not show that it is possible to apply Western scientific methods without distorting the studied cultures.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the objection.
  Choice E does not provide a counter-argument to the criticism but reinforces the need for genuine understanding of other cultures.
  None of the choices provide a strong objection to the criticism.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
- The first version of multicultural education advocates for teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture’s values.
- The second version of multicultural education involves adopting a neutral stance with respect to cultural value differences, but still using Western scientific methods.
- Critics argue that using Western scientific methods to study other cultures is not adequate because Western methods are value-laden.
Thought:
- The second version of multicultural education uses Western scientific methods, which are value-laden and distort other cultures.
- To truly understand another culture, one must adopt that culture’s own perspectives and methods.
- Thus, an objection that would provide the strongest argument against this criticism of the second version would be one that shows that Western scientific methods can still lead to genuine understanding of other cultures.
- Answer choice D seems irrelevant to the argument.
- Answer choice A is not necessarily true, as cultural understanding can be achieved through education and immersion, even if one is not a member of that culture.
- Answer choice B is also not relevant to the argument, as similarity among non-Western cultures does not necessarily relate to the use of Western scientific methods.
- Answer choice C weakly suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system, but it does not provide any evidence that Western scientific methods can still lead to genuine understanding.
- Answer choice E supports the idea that genuine understanding is necessary for appreciating other cultures, but it does not provide any evidence to counter the criticism that Western scientific methods are value-laden and inadequate for understanding other cultures.
- Therefore, none of the answer choices provide a strong objection to the criticism in the passage.
- The answer is None of the Above.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal promotes multicultural understanding through teaching about other cultures, using the values of the majority culture.
  The second proposal promotes a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures, but still uses Western scientific methods.
  Critics argue that both proposals are problematic, and that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second proposal is that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is distorting and an expression of cultural chauvinism.
  To provide an objection to this criticism, we need to show that using Western scientific methods is not distorting or chauvinistic.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of using Western scientific methods.
  Choice B suggests that non-Western societies have value systems that are similar, but does not address the issue of using Western scientific methods.
  Choice C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value systems when studying cultures, but does not address the issue of using Western scientific methods.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it does not address the issue of using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures.
  Choice E is a restatement of the criticism, rather than an objection to it.
  None of the choices provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second proposal.
Criticism:
  None of the choices directly address the criticism of the second proposal.
  A possible objection could be that Western scientific methods are not necessarily value-laden, and that they can be used to study cultures in a neutral way.
  However, this objection would need to be supported by evidence and argumentation.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The first proposal of multicultural education suggests that teaching from the context of the majority culture can help promote multicultural understanding.
  The second proposal of multicultural education argues that adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures can help achieve multicultural understanding.
  The methods used to study cultures in the second proposal are still Western methods, such as anthropology and sociology.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that these methods involve a commitment to certain Western values and that understanding of non-scientific cultures can only be achieved by adopting their perspectives and methods.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second proposal is that understanding of non-scientific cultures can only be achieved by adopting their perspectives and methods.
  To object to this criticism, we need to show that there is another way to achieve understanding of non-scientific cultures without adopting their perspectives and methods.
  Option A suggests that one cannot adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture. This does not provide a strong objection to the criticism because it implies that the only way to understand non-Western cultures is to be a member of that culture.
  Option B suggests that many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another. This does not provide a strong objection to the criticism because it does not address the issue of Western methods being unsuitable for studying non-scientific cultures.
  Option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values. This also does not provide a strong objection to the criticism, as it does not address the issue of Western methods being unsuitable for studying non-scientific cultures.
  Option D suggests that students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations. This does not provide a strong objection to the criticism because it focuses on the achievements of Western societies, not non-Western cultures.
  Option E suggests that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. This also does not provide a strong objection to the criticism, as it does not address the issue of Western methods being unsuitable for studying non-scientific cultures.
  Therefore, there is no option that provides a strong objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the way in which Schoenberg's music is disturbing and essential because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
Thought: 
  Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Criticism: 
  The correct answer depends on the definition and understanding of what is meant by disturbing.
  While B may be a possible answer, it may not be the only option and its suitability is subjective.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the music of Arnold Schoenberg, including its evolution from the late-Romantic style to nontonal music, and the 12-tone technique Schoenberg created to bring order to this nontonal music. The passage also suggests that Schoenberg's music is essential because it expresses emotional states that music had not previously recorded.
Thought: 
  The passage states that some of Schoenberg's music remains disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
  To find an answer choice that is most analogous to this, we need to look for a comedian whose material also unflinchingly faces difficult truths in a way that might disturb people.
  Answer choice B, a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, might fit this description best.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not offer any explicit comparisons between Schoenberg's music and comedy, so it is possible to interpret the question and answer choices in different ways. 
  Answer choice B might seem to fit the passage's description of Schoenberg's music, but it might not be the best analogy for the kind of disturbance that Schoenberg's music produced.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the music of Arnold Schoenberg, which stirred controversy due to its altered language and extended expressive range.
  The passage describes how Schoenberg evolved through three different musical styles.
  The passage concludes that Schoenberg's music is essential because it "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
Thought:
  Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths and delineates previously unrecognized emotional states.
  The most analogous option would be one that deals with difficult truths or previously unrecognized emotions.
  Option A involves vulgar humor, which does not fit this description.
  Option C involves material already made famous by other comedians, which is irrelevant.
  Option D involves an extreme political philosophy, which is also irrelevant.
  Option E involves unfamiliar humor, which is also irrelevant.
  That leaves option B, which involves comedy that shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore. This is similar to Schoenberg's music in that it deals with previously unrecognized emotional states.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Criticism:
  It is possible to interpret the question in multiple ways, which may lead to different answers.
  Additionally, the passage discusses music and not comedy, which makes it difficult to draw a direct analogy.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the controversial and challenging music of Arnold Schoenberg.
  It also discusses how Schoenberg's music expressed emotional states that had not been recorded in music before.
Thought:
  The passage describes the disturbing nature of Schoenberg's music as resulting from its ability to precisely delineate recognizable and sometimes uncomfortable emotional states.
  Therefore, something that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing would be something that also precisely delineates uncomfortable emotional states that are not commonly recorded in its art form.
  Of the choices, only B, a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, seems to fit this description.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about Arnold Schoenberg and his music.
  Schoenberg's music was controversial and considered disturbing.
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Schoenberg's music "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
  Therefore, the answer should be something that also delves into difficult emotional states.
  Out of the choices, B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, is the only one that seems to fit.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Arnold Schoenberg and how his music pushed the boundaries of traditional tonal music, and how his music was sometimes described as disturbing.
Thought: 
  The passage explains that Schoenberg's music could be unsettling because it explored new emotional landscapes in music. Therefore, the most analogous description would be a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Criticism: 
  There is no perfect answer, as the passage does not make a direct analogy to any type of comedian. 
  However, the passage suggests that Schoenberg's music was disturbing because of its emotional intensity and its ability to express difficult truths. 
  In this sense, option B seems to best capture the idea of exploring difficult truths. The other options do not relate as closely to the passage's discussion of Schoenberg's music.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the controversy surrounding the music of Arnold Schoenberg and how his music was characterized as disturbing.
Thought:
  Schoenberg's music was disturbing in the sense that it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  To find something that could be similarly disturbing, we need to look for something that also unflinchingly faces difficult truths or realities.
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore could be similar to this.
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor, C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians, D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy, and E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience do not appear to be analogous to Schoenberg's disturbing music.
  Therefore, the most analogous answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Schoenberg's music as disturbing because it precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
Thought: 
  To be analogous to Schoenberg's music, the disturbing thing would also have to precisely delineate recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states.
  Option A describes a comedian who relies heavily on vulgar humor. While some might find that type of humor disturbing, it is not because it precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states.
  Option B describes a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore. This could be seen as analogous to Schoenberg's music in that it is also concerned with exploring and expressing new emotional states that may be difficult to confront.
  Option C describes a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians. This does not seem to be analogous to Schoenberg's music.
  Option D describes a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy. While this might be disturbing to some, it does not seem to be analogous to Schoenberg's music.
  Option E describes a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience. This does not seem to be analogous to Schoenberg's music either.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the controversial nature of Arnold Schoenberg's music and how it pushed the boundaries of traditional music.
  The author argues that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is how it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
Thought: 
  The question asks us to identify which of the following is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in the passage.
  The passage tells us that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
  This suggests that the answer will be something that similarly "delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states" that are not commonly expressed in the given medium.
  Choice B fits this description, as a comedian who "shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore" could be said to be similarly disturbing in the sense that they are expressing difficult or taboo ideas.
  Choices A, C, and D all describe comedians whose material is either vulgar, unoriginal, or extreme in some political way. While these comedians may be unsettling or controversial, none of them seem to fit the criteria mentioned in the passage for what makes Schoenberg's music essential.
  Choice E describes a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience, but this does not necessarily mean that they are disturbing in the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing.
Criticism: 
  It is possible to argue that there are other possible interpretations of what makes Schoenberg's music "essential" beyond the one provided in the passage, so it is not necessarily clear that choice B is the best answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how Schoenberg altered the language and extended the expressive range of music and how some of his work remains disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Thought:
  The question asks which one of the following is disturbing in a way that is most analogous to Schoenberg's music.
  The passage notes that Schoenberg's music remains disturbing because it faces difficult truths.
  Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be one that also faces difficult truths.
  Answer B is the only option that fits the criteria.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education: one that uses the values of the majority culture to examine other cultures, and another that maintains a neutral stance on value differences among cultures but still uses Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism and that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is necessary for real understanding.
Thought:
  The third version of multicultural education referred to in the passage would likely object to any study that uses Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture because such methods represent an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism and would not lead to real understanding.
  Therefore, the answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct based on the information in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Multicultural education has two main proposals:
  - The first proposal claims that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture.
  - The second proposal differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. 
  Critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
Thought: 
  The third version of multicultural education holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms.
  The second proposal of multicultural education differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second proposal of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
  Using the methods of Western science for examining a nonscientific culture is objectionable according to the critics of the second proposal of multicultural education.
  Therefore, the most objectionable option would be C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.

  The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version are still Western in nature.
  Critics of the second version argue that Western scientific methods are value-laden and do not provide real understanding of other cultures. 
Thought: 
  Proponents of the second version of multicultural education take a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures.
  The methods of the second version are still Western in nature and may have a privileged place in Western cultures.
  Critics argue that adopting Western scientific methods to understand nonscientific cultures is an expression of maintaining a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. 
  Among the given choices, C is most likely considered objectionable by proponents of the second version of multicultural education.
  Therefore, the answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism:

  The second version promotes multicultural understanding by adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures while still utilizing Western scientific methods. 
  The third version, which is not discussed in the passage, is likely to be objectionable to proponents of the second version.
Thought: 
  The third version of multicultural education is not discussed in the passage.
  The second version promotes adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures while still utilizing Western scientific methods. 
  The third version may be objectionable to proponents of the second version because it may involve employing the methods of Western science to understand nonscientific cultures. 
  Choice C describes a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture. 
  Therefore, choice C is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version holds that examination of other cultures should proceed from within the context of the majority culture's methods, perspectives, and values.
  The second version holds that multicultural education should adopt a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures, but still uses Western scientific methods.
  Critics of the second version argue that using Western scientific methods to study non-scientific cultures is distorting and an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. 
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses the objections of critics of the second version of multicultural education.
  They argue that using Western scientific methods to study non-scientific cultures is distorting and an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, proponents of the second version would most likely object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
  The answer is C.
Criticism:
  There is no flaw in the reasoning applied here to answer the question.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version proposes to teach about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values, such as democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons.
  The second proposal argues for a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures, but still employs Western scientific methods.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value laden, and the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
Thought: 
  The third paragraph discusses the objection to the second version of multicultural education, which holds that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective.
  The objection claims that Western scientific methods are already value-laden, and that trying to understand non-scientific cultures by Western scientific methods is an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, proponents of the second version of multicultural education would most likely find objectionable a study of a nonscientific culture that employs the methods of Western science to investigate it.
  Choice C describes this type of study, so the answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism: 
  The answer is correct based on the information in the passage.
  However, the statement in the question stem that "proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph" is somewhat ambiguous, as the third paragraph discusses a criticism of the second version of multicultural education rather than a specific version.
  Nonetheless, based on the argument presented in the third paragraph, it is reasonable to assume that proponents of multicultural education who are concerned with cultural chauvinism would object to a study that employs Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses different perspectives on multicultural education.
  The first version of multicultural education advocates for teaching about other cultures using the methods and values of the majority culture.
  Critics argue that this approach is not sufficient for genuine understanding of other cultures.
  The second version of multicultural education emphasizes cultural neutrality but still relies on Western methods of examination.
  Critics argue that this is not truly different from the first version of multicultural education, as the examination methods are still value-laden and derived from Western scientific heritage.
Thought:
  The third version of multicultural education is not explicitly discussed in the passage.
  However, proponents of this version would likely be opposed to using Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture, as this would be seen as distorting and Eurocentric.
  Choice C describes this type of study.
  Therefore, the most objectionable study to proponents of the third version of multicultural education is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures from the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture (liberal values).
  The second version promotes multicultural understanding by adopting a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures but still using Western scientific methods of examination, study, and explanation.
  Critics argue that both versions are problematic because they impose Western values and methods on other cultures.
Thought:
  The question asks which study would be objectionable to proponents of the third version of multicultural education.
  The third version advocates for adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied to achieve genuine understanding.
  A study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would be objectionable to proponents of the third version because it is still imposing Western values and methods on the culture.
  Therefore, the answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism:
  There are no flaws in this analysis.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.
  D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  E: "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed someone not from the Border region.

Thought: 
  The passage states that corridos are composed of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another, particularly the formal closing verse, or despedida.
  The fourth line of the despedida varies according to the subject of the corrido, and the second line varies according to rhyme.
  Although the specific details of each corrido may vary, all complete corridos have some lines and subject matter in common.
  Therefore, C: All complete corridos have some lines in common, is the most appropriate inference based on the passage.
Criticism:
  None.

Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses corridos, a type of narrative folk song that originated in the Lower Rio Grande Border region and has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. The narratives of corridos are specific to the Border region and are usually about a single important event. Corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings and affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow. They are composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. In the despedida, or the formal closing verse of the corrido, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Thought: 
  The passage describes the characteristics and conventions of corridos. It states that corridos served to commemorate local happenings and affirm community cohesion, so it is unlikely that "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings. The passage mentions that "El Corrido de Kiansis" is the oldest complete corrido and that different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements, which suggests that most surviving corridos exist in complete form and have some lines in common. The passage also states that corridos are composed of certain ready-made lines, including a set convention for the despedida, which suggests that most corrido variants have the same despedida. There is no evidence in the passage to support the claim that "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed by someone not from the Border region. 
  Therefore, the best answer is C: All complete corridos have some lines in common. 
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state that all complete corridos have some lines in common, but it strongly implies it, particularly in the discussion of the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. It states that the despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" includes a set convention for the first and third line and that the second and fourth lines are variable, with the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. The passage further states that the despedida is perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity. Because the corrido's maker uses the despedida to assert that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished, it is likely that most complete corridos have some lines in common.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions as a new type of infectious pathogen responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  Prions are protein-based pathogens that reproduce themselves by inducing normally-shaped prions to take on the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prion infections are inevitably fatal and the body does not produce an immune response.
Thought:
  The author emphasizes the destructive nature of prions and how they lead to the brain becoming riddled with tiny holes, which is characteristic of CJD.
  The author explains that prions reproduce in a different way and do not require genetic material like other pathogens.
  The author also indicates that there is no effective therapy to halt the reproduction of affected prions.
  Thus, the author would be least likely to agree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease, as the passage consistently describes CJD as inevitably fatal and does not mention any known cures or treatments.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - A disease-causing agent is a pathogen, that establishes a viable presence in the organism.
  - Infectious agents are viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, which reproduce and regulate life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA).
  - Scientists discovered a new type of protein pathogen called prions, which do not contain nucleic acids and are able to reproduce and cause cell destruction via a chain reaction.
  - CJD is an incurable, degenerative form of dementia caused by prions.
Thought: 
  The author holds significant concerns about the prion-based pathogen responsible for CJD, as it is unique compared to traditional pathogens and currently incurable and fatal. 
  A: The presence of abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease and is central to the diagnosis of CJD. This statement is supported by the passage, so the author would likely agree with it.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease. This statement contradicts the passage which highlights that CJD is inevitably fatal.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction. The passage specifically mentions that prions are a new type of pathogen that lacks nucleic acid and reproduces itself via a chain reaction, so the author would agree with this statement. 
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD. This statement is supported by the passage as CJD is incurable, and the body doesn't produce an immune response against prions. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce. This statement is true as the passage mentions that the exact mechanism by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction has yet to be completely understood. Therefore the author would likely agree with this statement.
Criticism: 
  There is no factually inaccurate statement among the answer choices. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a degenerative form of dementia in humans.

  Prions are infectious and can cause cellular destruction.
Thought: 
  The author describes prions as a new type of pathogen that is distinct from viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites.
  The author notes that prions occur naturally in the body and do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  The author also notes that CJD is inevitably fatal and that there are no known effective therapies to prevent the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
  Therefore, the author is likely to disagree with choice B, which states that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that any patients with CJD will recover from the disease.
  In fact, the passage specifically notes that CJD is inevitably fatal.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  CJD is a degenerative form of dementia that causes nerve cell death in the brain.
  Prions are unique in that they lack nucleic acid and reproduce by converting other normal proteins into the abnormal pathogenic conformation.
  Because prions are proteins and occur naturally in the body, the body does not produce an immune response against them.
Thought: 
  The author is least likely to agree with a statement that contradicts the information presented in the passage.
  A: The passage describes how prions cause brain tissue destruction, so the author would likely agree that the presence of abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal and there are no treatments to prevent the reproduction of prions, so the author would not agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: The passage describes how prions do not contain nucleic acid and reproduce by converting other normal proteins into the abnormal pathogenic conformation, so the author would agree that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The passage describes how prions occur naturally in the body and the body does not produce an immune response against them, so the author would agree that the body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: The passage describes how scientists have yet to fully understand the mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction, so the author would agree that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
  Therefore, the author is least likely to agree with B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a degenerative form of dementia in humans characterized by tiny holes in the brain and nerve cell death.
  Prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens and can cause CJD by converting harmless cellular proteins into an abnormal shape.
  Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins and the immune system doesn't respond to them.
Thought: 
  The author discusses at length the dangers posed by prions and the lack of natural defense against them. 
  The author also notes that CJD is inevitably fatal, although there are some variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and how aggressively the disease progresses. 
  Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the author discusses at length the dangers posed by prions and the lack of natural defense against them, as well as the fatal nature of CJD with limited variations in the disease progression for every individual. 
  However, the author does not mention any possibility of patients recovering from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen.
  Prions reproduce by converting normally shaped prions into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Unlike other pathogens, prions occur naturally in the body as proteins so the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
Thought:
  The author seems to agree with most of the statements made in the passage.
  A: The passage describes how prions can cause the destruction of nerve cells in the brain, leading to symptoms of neurological disease like CJD. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement.
  B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Therefore, the author is least likely to agree with this statement.
  C: The passage describes how the pathogen responsible for CJD is a protein pathogen that lacks nucleic acids. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement.
  D: The passage discusses how prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, so the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement.
  E: The passage states that the exact mechanism by which prions reproduce themselves has yet to be completely understood. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  CJD is a degenerative form of dementia in humans that causes brain damage and is often fatal.
  Prions are a type of protein pathogen that are infectious and capable of reproducing themselves.
  Unlike other pathogens, prions occur naturally in the body as proteins and do not elicit an immune response.
  Prions convert normally shaped proteins into abnormal, pathogenic conformation, which leads to the formation of plaques in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.
  There is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, and CJD is inevitably fatal.
Thought:
  The author would be LEAST likely to agree with which of the following statements?
  A: The passage discusses the correlation of abnormal prions to certain types of neurological diseases, such as CJD. Thus, the author is likely to agree with this statement.
  B: The passage states that there are no effective therapies for preventing the reproduction of prions, and CJD is inevitably fatal. Hence, the author would be unlikely to agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: The passage discusses how scientists discovered that the prion disease agent lacks nucleic acid and consists mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Thus, the author would agree that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The passage discusses how the body does not produce an immune response when prions are present and that there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves. Hence, the author would agree that the body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: The passage concludes that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood. Hence, the author would likely agree that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
  B is the statement the author would be LEAST likely to agree with since it directly contradicts the information presented in the passage that CJD is inevitably fatal and there are no effective therapies for preventing its reproduction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  Prions are infectious and can reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  The body does not produce an immune response to prions, and there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves. CJD is inevitably fatal.
Thought: 
  The passage describes CJD as inevitably fatal, with wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and how aggressively the disease progresses.
  Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with choice B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not mention anything about patients recovering from CJD.
  However, the author would disagree with this statement, not be least likely to agree with it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions as a new type of protein pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  CJD is a degenerative form of dementia that causes impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia.
  Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, but upon further study, scientists discovered that they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape and reproducing themselves by initiating a chain reaction.
Thought: 
  The author seems to believe that prions are a new type of infectious pathogen.
  The author provides evidence that shows prions can cause CJD and that prions can reproduce themselves without nucleic acid.
  The author also discusses the lack of natural defense against CJD by the body and the incomplete understanding of prion reproduction mechanisms.
  The author does not suggest that any patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  Therefore, the author would be LEAST likely to agree with choice B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that any patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  Therefore, the author would not agree with choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a degenerative form of dementia caused by a pathogen called prion.
  Prions are a type of protein pathogen that lack nucleic acid and can reproduce themselves by converting normally shaped prions into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions can occur naturally in the body as proteins and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  CJD is inevitably fatal and there are no effective therapies to prevent the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
Thought: 
  The author discusses the characteristics of prions and the disease they cause (CJD).
  The author provides evidence to support the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens.
  The author also indicates that CJD is inevitably fatal and there are no current therapies to prevent it.
  The author would be least likely to agree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism: 
  Your inference is correct that the author discusses the characteristics of prions and the disease they cause (CJD) and provides evidence to support the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The economic principle of utility maximization holds that a rational person will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. In other words, the expected utility of an action is the sum of the utilities of each possible outcome of the action, each multiplied by the probability that it will occur.
Thought: The rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is the one that maximizes the individual's expected utility. Therefore, the least appropriate example would be the one where the individual does not choose the action that maximizes their expected utility.
A: The waiter's action maximizes his expected utility by reducing his taxes, and he believes that the likelihood of being caught is small. This is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
B: The motorist's action maximizes her expected utility by avoiding a speeding ticket and the loss of her driver's license. This is also a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
C: The industrialist's action does not maximize his expected utility, as the cost of treatment exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant. This is a rational response, but not the most appropriate one.
D: The government official's action maximizes her expected utility by soliciting bribes to support her family. This is also a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
E: The worker's action does not maximize his expected utility, as it is likely to result in legal trouble and other negative consequences. This is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Criticism: The worker's action is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, but it is not an economic action either. The passage states that the utility maximization principle applies to economic actions, and physical assault is not an economic action. Therefore, the least appropriate example in the choices is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The utility maximization principle explains that rational individuals will choose the option that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
Thought:
  A: The waiter expects to receive higher overall satisfaction by concealing his tip income from the government, even if he is caught and penalized because he believes that the chance of being caught is very low.
  B: The motorist decides not to speed on a heavily patrolled road to avoid the loss of her driver's license, which would lead to a decrease in overall satisfaction.
  C: The industrialist decides to illegally discharge pollutants into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegal discharge, thus maximizing overall satisfaction.
  D: The government official decides to risk prosecution for soliciting bribes because her government salary is inadequate to support her and her family, thus maximizing overall satisfaction.
  E: The worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair, but the assault is unlikely to maximize his overall satisfaction.
  Therefore, choice E would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle, which asserts that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  A: The waiter's decision to conceal a large part of his tip income is a response to the economic incentive of reducing taxes, which, according to the utility maximization principle, could be considered a rational response.
  B: The motorist's decision to avoid speeding on a certain stretch of road is a response to the economic disincentive of losing her driver's license, which is also a rational response.
  C: The industrialist's decision to continue discharging an untreated pollutant into a river could be considered a rational response to the economic disincentive of the high cost of treatment and the low cost of the fine.
  D: The government official's decision to solicit bribes as a response to financial hardship could also be considered a rational response to a strong economic incentive.
  E: The worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor is not a rational response to an economic incentive or disincentive, but rather an impulsive response to a perceived injustice.
Thought:
  The question is asking which of the options would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, according to the utility maximization principle.
  Options A through D all describe situations where an individual's behavior is influenced by some form of economic incentive or disincentive, which is in line with the utility maximization principle.
  Option E, on the other hand, describes a situation where an individual's behavior is not influenced by an economic incentive or disincentive but rather an emotional response to perceived injustice.
  Therefore, option E would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the utility maximization principle, which posits that individuals make rational decisions based on anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility, which is determined by the likelihood and utility of possible outcomes. The passage also defines deterrence and discusses strategies for deterring crime.
Thought: A rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is one that maximizes an individual's anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The passage provides examples of the application of the utility maximization principle to various scenarios involving economic incentives and disincentives, and it suggests that the principle applies to deliberate crime. The scenario that is least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is one in which the individual does not act to maximize anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
A: This option describes a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the waiter is acting to minimize his taxes, which would increase his expected utility, by concealing his tip income, which he believes is unlikely to be detected, and thus, unlikely to result in penalties. 
B: This option describes a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the motorist is avoiding speeding, which would increase the likelihood and cost of a speeding ticket and loss of her driver's license, through rational consideration of the consequences of her actions.
C: This option describes a response to economic incentives and disincentives that could be rational if the cost of treatment for the pollutant was greater than the fine for illegal discharge. However, it assumes that the industrialist only considers the cost of treatment and not the risk of detection and penalties, which may also be relevant to the expected utility calculation.
D: This option describes a response to economic incentives and disincentives that could be rational if the risk of prosecution and penalties for soliciting bribes was deemed to be less costly than the economic hardship faced by the government official and her family. However, it assumes that the official does not consider the ethical and legal implications of soliciting bribes, which may also be relevant to the expected utility calculation.
E: This option describes a response to economic incentives and disincentives that is unlikely to be rational because the worker is acting impulsively and based on emotions rather than anticipated overall satisfaction. The worker is not considering the likelihood and utility of possible outcomes but instead reacting to a perceived injustice. 
Therefore, the least appropriately described rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
Thought: 
  The question asks for the least appropriate example of a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives based on the utility maximization principle.
  A is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the waiter is trying to maximize his expected utility by reducing his taxes, even though he is breaking the law.
  B is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the motorist is trying to avoid losing her driver's license by avoiding speeding, which will lead to a fine.
  C is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the industrialist is trying to minimize costs by illegally discharging the untreated pollutant into the river, even though it is against the law.
  D is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the government official is trying to maximize her expected utility by soliciting bribes, which will help support her and her family in the face of inflation.
  E is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, because the worker is responding impulsively to his perceived injustice, rather than maximizing his expected utility.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle, which says that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  Rational response to economic incentives or disincentives will depend on the expected utility from a particular action.
Thought:
  The question asks about which option would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives.
  Option A describes a waiter who conceals his tip income to reduce his taxes. The waiter believes it is unlikely that he will be detected and punished. This can be seen as a rational response to reduce his tax burden.
  Option B describes a motorist who avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road, knowing that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to a loss of her driver's license. This response can be seen as a rational response to avoid losing her driving privileges and the costly consequences that follow from such a loss.
  Option C describes an industrialist who continues to discharge untreated pollutants into a river despite the illegality of the act because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for the illegal activity. This also can be seen as a rational response to minimize the financial costs of compliance.
  Option D describes a government official who risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because her government salary is inadequate to support her and her family. This can also be seen as a rational response to meet basic needs and obligations.
  However, option E describes a worker who physically assaults his former supervisor, a crime of passion. This response is impulsive and not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives.
Criticism: 
  The options A, B, C, and D are rational responses to economic incentives or disincentives, but option E is an impulsive crime that does not reflect a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The utility maximization principle holds that a rational person will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility, based on weighing the utilities of possible outcomes of an action and the likelihood of each outcome coming to pass.
Thought:
  Option A describes a waiter who hides his tips to reduce his taxes since he believes it is unlikely that it will be detected and penalized.
  Option B describes a motorist who avoids speeding on a particular road because it may lead to the loss of her driver's license.
  Option C describes an industrialist who continues to discharge untreated pollutants into a river since the cost of treatment exceeds the fines imposed for illegal discharge.
  Option D describes a government official in an impoverished country who solicits bribes to supplement her inadequate government salary.
  Option E describes a worker who physically assaults his former supervisor because he was dismissed from his job.
  All options describe a rational choice in response to actual or perceived economic incentives or disincentives, except for option E, which describes an impulsive crime of passion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains the utility maximization principle, which predicts that people respond rationally to economic incentives and disincentives by choosing the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
Thought: 
  A: The waiter's decision to conceal his tip income from the government in order to reduce his taxes is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because, in his calculation, the expected utility from doing so exceeds the utility of reporting his full tip income.
  B: The motorist's decision to avoid speeding on a heavily patrolled road because she knows that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license is a rational response to economic disincentives because the expected utility from obeying the law exceeds the utility of violating the law and getting caught.
  C: The industrialist's decision to continue to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because, in his calculus, the expected utility from continuing to discharge the pollutant exceeds the utility of stopping the discharge.
  D: The government official's decision to solicit bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because, in her calculation, the expected utility from soliciting bribes exceeds the utility of not soliciting bribes.
  E: The worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the expected utility from physically assaulting his supervisor does not exceed the utility of not assaulting his supervisor. Rather, his action is an impulsive crime of passion.
  Therefore, E is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
Thought: 
  A: The waiter's action of concealing a large part of his tip income from the government is a rational response to economic incentives since he is trying to reduce his tax bill. Therefore, it is a rational response to incentives.
  B: The motorist's action of avoiding speeding on a heavily patrolled road due to the fear of losing her driver's license is a rational response to disincentives since she is trying to avoid the negative consequence of losing her license. Therefore, it is a rational response to disincentives.
  C: The industrialist's decision to continue to illegally discharge untreated pollutants into the river is a rational response to economic incentives since it is less expensive to pay the fine than to engage in proper treatment of the pollutant. Therefore, it is a rational response to incentives.
  D: The government official's decision to risk prosecution for soliciting bribes due to inflation rendering her salary inadequate is a rational response to economic incentives since she is trying to provide for herself and her family. Therefore, it is a rational response to incentives.
  E: The worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor is not a rational response to economic incentives. It is an impulsive act of violence and not a calculated decision based on anticipated satisfaction or utility. Therefore, it is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
Thought: 
  Within the economic framework of the utility maximization principle, all of the actions described could be considered rational responses to economic incentives and disincentives because they involve weighing the expected costs and benefits of different courses of action and choosing the one that maximizes expected utility. 
  Answer choices A, B, and C all involve an individual weighing the expected costs and benefits of committing an illegal act against the probability of being caught and punished to decide whether or not to engage in the illegal act. 
  Answer choice D involves an individual weighing the expected benefits of accepting bribes against the potential costs of being caught and punished to decide whether or not to engage in the bribery. 
  Answer choice E does not involve a rational economic calculation of expected costs and benefits, but rather an impulsive response to a perceived injustice. 
  Thus, answer choice E is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.
  D: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
  E: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style was a late-Romantic manner with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style pushed those unstable harmonies further and eliminated tonality.
  The third style developed the 12-tone technique as a means of stabilizing nontonal music.
Thought:
  The passage mentions that each of the three styles, at the time, was seen as a departure from the previous style.
  However, the passage also notes that Schoenberg believed that his musical development was a natural progression.
  The author of the passage notes that Schoenberg's music became more condensed and violent in contrasts as the styles progressed, which implies a connection and progression.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would be most likely to agree with statement D: The second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Schoenberg wrote in three different musical styles during his career.
  The first style was the late-Romantic manner.
  The second style was marked by the absence of tonality.
  The third style was the 12-tone technique.
  The author of the passage admires Schoenberg's mastery of all three styles.
Thought: 
  Each successive style represents a departure from the previous one.
  The second style, characterized by the absence of tonality, is especially distinct from the previous style.
  However, the third style is a natural progression from the second, as it uses a new system to bring stability to nontonal music.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with statement D: "The second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second."
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism of the thought process.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. 
  Schoenberg began in the late-Romantic manner, then pushed unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis, and finally developed the 12-tone technique.
  As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow.
Thought:
  The author suggests that each of Schoenberg's three musical styles had its own unique purpose and evolution.
  The author notes that Schoenberg's first style was rooted in the late-Romantic tradition and was pervasive during his youth.
  The author contends that Schoenberg's second style was a natural progression from the first in that he pushed the unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  The author suggests that the 12-tone technique was developed as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it, marking a natural progression from the second style.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would most likely agree with the statement that "The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second."
  The answer is D: The second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
Criticism:
  The passage does not suggest that any of Schoenberg's styles were inexplicable departures from the previous one.
  Instead, the author contends that each style represented a natural progression from the previous style, albeit with new techniques and ways of expression.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the correct answer would be that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  The answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Schoenberg worked in three different musical styles: late-Romantic, atonal, and 12-tone.
  Schoenberg evolved his music with time, but he never departed entirely from tradition.
  Schoenberg's music is difficult to follow, but his technical mastery was awe-inspiring.
Thought:
  The author describes how Schoenberg's music evolved through three different styles.
  The first style is described as "late-Romantic," and the second style as "atonal," which implies a departure.
  However, the author notes that Schoenberg never departed entirely from tradition, and evolved his music with time.
  The author describes the third style as involving the 12-tone technique and stabilizing nontonal music.
  The passage suggests that each style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with statement A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Criticism:
  There is no significant flaw in the author's thought process.
Action: Answer("A")

  The passage discusses the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The author notes that Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory.
  Schoenberg began in the late-Romantic manner, pushing unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  He later developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
Thought:
  Schoenberg's three styles represent a progression from one to the other, with each successive style building on the previous one.
  The author notes that Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory, suggesting that each style was a response to the previous one.
  The author notes that Schoenberg pushed unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis, and later developed the 12-tone technique as a means of stabilizing nontonal music.
  This suggests a progression from the first style to the second, and from the second style to the third.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:

Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style was late-Romantic music with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style pushed unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  The third style was developed around the 12-tone technique as a means of stabilizing nontonal music.
Thought:
  The author notes that Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory.
  The first style was a natural progression from the late-Romantic manner of Schoenberg's youth.
  The second style pushed unstable harmonies to a new level, which could be perceived as an inexplicable departure from the first, but it was necessary for Schoenberg to express himself as he was compelled to.
  The third style was developed as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it, and it drew heavily on the techniques developed in the second style. This suggests that the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement D: The second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Schoenberg worked in three different musical styles: late-Romantic manner, atonal music, and the 12-tone technique.
  The author believes that Schoenberg's music is about expressing emotional states and difficult truths.
Thought: 
  The author describes Schoenberg's development through three distinct styles.
  The author also talks about how Schoenberg pushed unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis and developed 12-tone technique. 
  However, the author also states that "What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
  Therefore, it can be inferred that each of the styles represents a natural progression from the previous one since each new style allowed him to express his emotional states and difficult truths.
  The answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:

  The passage discusses the historical production of art by and for members of the elite classes, with a focus on the two ways art was commissioned.
  The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display, which reflected well on their taste.
  The second way was for a work to be created expressing and mirroring the ideals and way of life of the elite.
  An analysis of the latter type of art can be complex, as it must consider the possibility of artists subverting the ideals of the patron and the fact that some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that there have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them, and that analyzing how art reflects the ideals of the elite can be a complex task.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two different ways that art historically was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  Sociocultural critics prefer to deal with the second way and claim that such art embodied the ideology of the elite.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: The author refers. to the early days of biotechnology (line 38) primarily in order to
Choices:
  A: furnish a brief account of the evolution of academic biotechnology research

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)
  B: "highly diverse" (line 10)

  The author is critical of the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies, suggesting that scholars have "overlooked" traditional modes of communication and cultural constructs of Native Americans.
  Choices A, B, C, and D all describe the deficiencies of earlier scholarship that the author points out, but none of them specifically convey the author's attitude.
  Choice E, however, uses more emotive language to suggest that the author finds the intercultural collaboration employed by Native Americans in their autobiographical expressions to be quite different from the European style of autobiography, which could indicate a negative attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  Therefore, the best choice is E: "alien to the European style" (line 51).
Criticism:
  It is possible for the author to describe the intercultural collaboration of Native Americans in their autobiographical expressions as "alien to the European style" without necessarily having a negative attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  The passage suggests that scholars were limited by their own cultural assumptions and biases, not that they were intentionally dismissive or negligent.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism
  D: admiration for its subtle critique of contemporary culture
  E: appreciation for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes a contradiction between the concepts of the Pin Factory and the Invisible hand. 
  Smith argued that as a company increased in size, it would become more efficient.
  However, as a company became larger, it could achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business, leading toward monopoly.
Thought: 
  The connection the author draws between increased size and monopoly power is based on the idea that as a company becomes larger it can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business, leading towards monopoly.
  If it is possible for a larger business to not have the power to dominate the market, then the connection between increased size and monopoly power may be undermined.
  Option A suggests that larger businesses are unable to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even if they have an overwhelming advantage in other regions due to varying local factors.
  Therefore, A may undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The author argues that increasing returns to scale leads to a natural tendency towards monopoly because larger businesses can achieve lower costs than smaller businesses. The author also argues that the free market requires many competitors in each industry to prevent anyone from exerting monopoly power.
A: The statement suggests that some businesses can exert monopoly power despite the presence of larger businesses in other regions, but it does not undermine the author's argument overall.
B: This statement addresses the impact of specialization on salaries and does not relate to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
C: This statement supports the author's point that a few players in an industry can exert monopoly power, which would undermine the idea of a competitive market.
D: This statement does not directly undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power but rather highlights that the size at which increasing returns occur can vary.
E: The statement suggests that further specialization may not result in increased productivity, which could undermine the argument that specialization leads to increasing returns. 

Thought:
Option A, B, and C are not relevant and do not undermine the argument.
Option D highlights that the size at which increasing returns occurs can vary, but does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Option E undermines the argument by suggesting that specialization may not always lead to increased productivity.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that the Pin Factory, where workers specialize in narrow tasks, leads to increasing returns to scale, which can lead to monopoly power.
Thought:
  The question asks which option will most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option A talks about businesses that have monopoly power in one region even though there are larger businesses in other regions. This does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it only states that larger businesses may exist elsewhere.
  Option B talks about workers being unable to command a high salary when their tasks become too narrow. This may have an impact on the Pin Factory but does not directly relate to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option C talks about collusion between businesses that have attained monopoly power. This reinforces the idea that increased size can lead to monopoly power.
  Option D talks about the varying size of businesses needed to achieve increasing returns to scale. This does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option E talks about offsetting factors to specialization that may hinder productivity gains, but this does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Therefore, Option A, B, D, and E can be eliminated.
  Option C reinforces the idea of monopoly power, which undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Criticism:
  There is no flaw in the logical process used to arrive at this answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the inherent contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  Smith's Pin Factory example emphasizes the efficiency that can be achieved through increased size and specialization.
  Increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, while the Invisible Hand works best with many competitors in each industry.
Thought: 
  The author connects increased size and specialization to increasing returns, which tend to create a natural tendency toward monopoly. 
  If there is a reason why the connection between increased size and monopoly power is weakened, then the author's argument is undermined.
  Options A, C, and E do not seem to weaken the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
  Option B does not address monopoly power.  
  Option D suggests that the size required to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, which could make it more difficult for a dominant player to achieve monopoly power.
  This does not necessarily contradict the idea that increasing returns tend to create a natural tendency toward monopoly, but it does suggest that it may be more difficult to achieve a monopoly in some industries than in others.
  Therefore, option D weakens the author's argument the most.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the tension between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory represents the idea that bigger firms can achieve larger scale and lower costs than smaller firms, leading to natural monopolies.
  The Invisible Hand represents the idea that self-interest in a competitive marketplace can lead to the common good.
  The assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, which is why increasing returns were not emphasized.
Thought:
  The Pin Factory shows that there are increasing returns to scale, which can lead to natural monopolies.
  The Invisible Hand relies on the assumption of many competitors in each industry, preventing any one player from exerting monopoly power.
  If there are businesses able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions, then the connection between increased size and monopoly power would be undermined.
  Therefore, the answer is A.
Criticism:
  The passage does not mention anything about geographical regions and their impact on monopoly power. However, it is still possible for an industry to have a dominant player in one region even if there are larger players in other regions.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The author of the passage discusses the contradiction between increasing returns to scale and the idea that free markets always get it right. 
  Increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, while many competitors in each industry are necessary for the invisible hand to work properly and prevent monopoly power.
Thought:
  The author's argument is that increasing returns to scale associated with bigger firms lead to monopoly power and undermine the idea that free markets always get it right.
  Thus, evidence suggesting that bigger firms do not necessarily lead to monopoly power would undermine the author's argument.
  Choice (A) stating that businesses can exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions would undermine the connection the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
  Therefore, the answer is A.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  Pin Factory describes the increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale can create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The Invisible Hand describes how the market economy can harness self-interest to the common good.
  The Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The Pin Factory can create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry to work properly.
  Therefore, the Pin Factory undermines the connection between increased size and the Invisible Hand.
  C is incorrect because it reinforces the idea that the Pin Factory leads to monopoly power.
  D, E are irrelevant to the relationship between increased size and monopoly power.
  A is not strongly related to the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  B is important to the Pin Factory because it suggests that there is a limit to how specialized workers can be before they cannot command higher salaries.
  Therefore, B weakens the idea that increased size leads to monopoly power.
  The answer is B.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. 
  B is the only choice that addresses the relationship between increased size and monopoly power.
  Good job!
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the tension between increasing returns to scale (represented by the Pin Factory) and the need for competition to prevent monopoly power (represented by the Invisible Hand).
  The author argues that if returns to scale are increasing, then larger firms may have an advantage over smaller firms, leading to monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The author argues that if returns to scale are increasing, then bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, leading to a monopoly.
  Therefore, any statement that suggests larger firms do not necessarily have an advantage over smaller firms will undermine the author's argument.
  Choice D suggests that increasing returns to scale vary across industries, making it harder for firms to achieve a monopoly.
  Therefore, Choice D will most undermine the author's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, two concepts introduced by Adam Smith.
  Smith emphasized the efficiency gained by increased size and specialization in the Pin Factory, which leads to increasing returns to scale.
  However, increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which is opposed to the idea of many competitors in each industry needed for the Invisible Hand to work.
Thought:
  The author argues that the connection between increased size and monopoly power is based on the natural tendency toward monopoly created by increasing returns to scale.
  To undermine this connection, we need to provide evidence that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopoly power.
  Choice A does not undermine the connection because it still describes situations where there is monopoly power.
  Choice B is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice C actually supports the connection because it describes collusion, which is a form of monopoly power.
  Choice D, if true, would suggest that the natural tendency toward monopoly power may not always be present, as the size needed for increasing returns to scale varies.
  Choice E does not affect the tendency toward monopoly power created by increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, only choice D could potentially undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes the tension between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. 
  The Pin Factory represents the concept of increasing returns to scale, which can lead to monopoly power. 
  The Invisible Hand relies on free markets with many competitors so that no one can exert monopoly power. 
Thought: 
  The author argues that the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand can be in conflict because of the tendency of increasing returns to lead to monopoly power. 
  However, if there were other factors that could prevent monopoly power from taking hold, this would weaken the author's argument. 
  Option A suggests that some businesses are able to exert monopoly power in one region even though there are larger businesses in other regions. This implies that other factors besides size play a role in preventing monopoly power. 
  Thus, if Option A were true, it would undermine the author's argument. 
  Therefore, A is the correct answer. 
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the reasoning process in this answer.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society
  E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature

  Dostoyevsky believed that "the fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it."
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit, not on its usefulness or political aims.
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' views of realism in literature.
  According to Dostoyevsky, reality was not independent of the experiences of individuals.
  Therefore, the "realism" demanded by the radical critics, which depicted reality "as it is," was meaningless because reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  Dostoyevsky believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Dostoyevsky also believed that a work of art should stand or fall on its artistic merit, not on its usefulness or political aims.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view that art must serve a particular political view or be "useful" to people and society.
  The correct answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism
  The radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky's view of realism in literature differed from the radical critics' view.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the views and political diversity of Mexican American activists in the United States between 1930 and 1960.
  The passage raises questions about the representativeness of these views and the extent to which they were shared by the broader Mexican American population.
Thought:
  One cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  Ethnic consciousness is not directly linked to the rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization or the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States.
  The passage does not provide support for the claim that ethnic consciousness increases or decreases with assimilation into the culture of the United States or with the influence of Mexican American leaders over the broader population.
  The passage only raises questions about the representativeness of the views of Mexican American activists and the broader Mexican American population.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Mexican American Generation, a group of political activists in the United States between 1930 and 1960 who were more radical and diverse than previously recognized.
  The author argues that there were significant differences among various Mexican American organizations regarding political strategy, assimilation, and cultural maintenance.
  The author questions whether the views of these activists were representative of the Mexican American population at large.
Thought: 
  The passage does not support option A. Although the passage notes an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States during the period under discussion, it does not state that this increase led to an increase in ethnic consciousness.
  The passage does not support option C. There is no evidence in the passage that ethnic consciousness decreases as a result of assimilation.
  The passage does not support option D. Although the author questions whether the views of the Mexican American Generation were representative of the population at large, there is no evidence that the influence of Mexican American leaders directly affects ethnic consciousness.
  Option B is supported by the passage. The author notes that by 1930, the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, and that this new generation of Mexican Americans was more acculturated and politically active than its predecessor. However, the author also emphasizes that a better understanding of important variables such as patterns of Mexican immigration and naturalization is needed to fully understand the relationship between the increase in the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States and ethnic consciousness.
  Option E is also supported by the passage. The author suggests that a better understanding of patterns of Mexican immigration and naturalization is necessary to fully understand variations in ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the political activism of Mexican Americans in the United States between 1930 and 1960, and raises questions about the diversity of their views and the representativeness of the leaders studied.

  The passage notes that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States may have resulted in greater political activism, but also suggests that this trend may not have been representative of the Mexican American population as a whole.
  The passage does not support statements A, C, or D.
  The passage provides some evidence to support statement B.
  The passage explicitly supports statement E, which suggests that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization may have influenced ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans during the period studied.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Criticism: None
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Mexican American Generation and their political diversity and activism in the United States between 1930 and 1960. 
  Mario Garcia argues that this group was more radical and politically diverse than previously recognized and that they anticipated many of the reforms proposed by later Chicanos.
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Garcia argues that a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared between 1930 and 1960, one that was more acculturated and more politically active than its predecessors, influenced by their experiences of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans and determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. 
  However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists.
  The passage also mentions that variations in ethnic consciousness may be influenced by variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization.
  But, it does not support any particular statement about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
Criticism: 
  None.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound
  C: the royalties paid to authors by their publisbers
  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
  E: the total sales ofa book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller
Response 0:

Thought:
The phrase "whole categories of expense" is used to describe the costs that are eliminated with digital publishing. 
Choice A is not correct because the phrase does not relate to the fees collected by literary agents. 
Choice B is also incorrect because the phrase is not referring specifically to the cost of printing and binding a book. 
Choice C is not correct because the phrase is not referring to the royalties paid to authors by their publishers. 
Choice D is also not correct because the phrase is not referring specifically to the costs of retail trade in traditional printed books. 
Choice E is not correct because the phrase is not referring to the total sales of a book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that the digital publishing model is more efficient and less expensive than traditional publishing.
Thought:
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" is used to refer to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
  This includes the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers.
  The author is arguing that these costs are irrelevant to digital publication.
  Therefore, the author is suggesting that digital publishing will eliminate these expenses, making it more efficient and less expensive.
  The answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Criticism:
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" could also refer to other expenses associated with traditional publishing.
  While the costs specific to the retail trade are mentioned as an example of such expenses, they may not be the only expenses being referred to.
  Additionally, the phrase may be interpreted differently by different readers, so the answer may be subject to interpretation.

Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that digital publishing will be more efficient and less expensive than traditional publishing because it eliminates the costs of printing, shipping, and displaying physical books.
Thought:
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) refers to multiple costs that are being eliminated by digital publishing.
  Option A, the fees collected by literary agents, is not mentioned as a category of expense that is eliminated by digital publishing. So, it is not the correct answer.
  Option B, the price paid to have books printed and bound, is mentioned in the context to illustrate how digital publishing will be more efficient and less expensive than traditional publishing. However, it is a cost that is being eliminated rather than a category of expense. So, it is also not the correct answer.
  Option C, the royalties paid to authors by their publishers, is not a category of expense that is being eliminated. Even if most books are published digitally, authors will still receive royalties from their publishers for the sales of their books. So, it is not the correct answer.
  Option D, the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books, is mentioned in the context to illustrate how digital publishing will eliminate the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. These are all costs that are specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books. So, option D is the correct answer.
  Option E, the total sales of a book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller, is not referred to as a category of expense. So, it is not the correct answer.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")

  B: Printing and binding is discussed as a cost that is eliminated, which could be considered a "category of expense."
  C: Royalties paid to authors are discussed as something that will need to be adjusted due to changes in the industry.
  D: The costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books are discussed as being eliminated in the digital publishing model.
  E: This is not discussed as a "category of expense."
Thought: 
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) is being used to describe costs that are eliminated in the digital publishing model.
  The author has already discussed some specific costs that are eliminated, such as printing and shipping.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is B: the price paid to have books printed and bound.
Criticism:
  The answer could also potentially be D, as the costs specific to the retail trade (such as warehousing and displaying physical books) are also discussed as being eliminated in the digital publishing model.
  However, the specific language used in the phrase "whole categories of expense" seems to more closely align with the costs associated with printing and binding.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that most digital files of books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines.
  The digital publication of a book online involves no physical inventory, thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers.
Thought: 
  The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" to refer to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
  These costs include warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers.
  Therefore, the answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The author describes the benefits of digital publishing compared to traditional publishing. 
The author mentions the reduced costs of warehousing, shipping, displaying physical books, and returning unsold books to publishers. 
The author suggests that these costs are "irrelevant to digital publication."
Thought:
The phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) is referring to the costs associated with traditional publishing that do not apply to digital publishing.
The author specifically mentioned the reduced costs of warehousing, shipping, displaying physical books, and returning unsold books to publishers.
Therefore, the answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Criticism:
There is no mention of the literal agents' fees or the royalties paid to the authors in the context of "whole categories of expense." 
The phrase cannot refer to the price paid to have books printed and bound because this cost is specifically mentioned by the author as being replaced by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies.
The phrase cannot refer to the total sales of a book minus the value of books returned unsold because the author specifically mentions the elimination of costs associated with returning unsold books to publishers.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The author of the passage discusses digital publishing and its advantages over traditional print publishing.
  The author mentions that digital publishing eliminates certain categories of expenses.
Thought:
  The author says that certain categories of expenses are eliminated by digital publishing.
  The author then goes on to say that these expenses are not relevant to digital publication.
  Therefore, "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) must refer to costs that are not associated with digital publishing.
  Among the choices, only B: the price paid to have books printed and bound refers to costs that are not associated with digital publishing.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The authors of the passages are discussing the topic of jury nullification.
  Passage A examines the problems created by jury nullification, while Passage B argues that jury nullification can serve useful functions in certain circumstances.
  A: Passage A argues that juries are not required to explain their verdicts, making it impossible to know how often jury nullification occurs or whether it is being used for good or bad purposes.
  B: Both passages suggest that laws are subject to debate and scrutiny, with Passage B arguing that jury nullification can function as a way of indicating to the legislature that a law may be unjust.
  C: Neither passage makes a direct comparison between jurors and elected officials in terms of bias.
  D: Passage A argues that juries are not legislators and that their role is simply to apply the law, not interpret it. Passage B, however, suggests that in some cases, jury nullification can serve the purpose of indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with a particular law.
  E: Passage B suggests that jury nullification can serve as a way of indicating to police and prosecutors that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for a conviction to be appropriate, but neither passage takes a definitive stance on the issue of discretion for police and prosecutors.
Thought:
  The authors seem to be in agreement about the subject of jury nullification, but they differ in their views on whether juries can interpret the law or simply apply it.
  Passage A argues that juries are not legislators and have no obligation to think through the potential effects of an acquittal on others, suggesting that they should simply apply the law as it is.
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that jury nullification can serve as a way of indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with a particular law, suggesting that juries can interpret the law in certain circumstances.
  Therefore, the authors would likely disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  The answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that the power of jury nullification creates problems because we don't know how it is used and jurors are not legislators. The passage suggests that juries may use nullification for evil ends, may lack sufficient evidence to make a reasoned decision, and may not think through the effect an acquittal will have on others.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous or when a law is unjust. The passage suggests that nullification can assist the legislature by indicating that there may be a problem with a law. The passage also claims that instances of nullification based on factors that should be ignored are likely to be uncommon.
Thought:
  The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether the power of juries to nullify is problematic or not.
  Passage A is critical of jury nullification and argues that it creates problems, including using nullification for evil ends, lacking sufficient evidence, and having no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. 
  Passage B is more positive about jury nullification and argues that it can be a useful safety valve when law enforcement is overzealous or when a law is unjust. The passage also suggests that nullification can assist the legislature by indicating problems with a law and that nullification based on factors that should be ignored is uncommon.
  The passages do not directly address whether juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts, whether laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people, whether elected officials are more biased than jurors, or whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion in deciding which violations of the law to pursue.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses jury nullification and the problems created by it.
  Passage B defends jury nullification and suggests that it can be a useful tool for the legislature.
  A: relates to the disclosure of reasoning behind jury verdicts.
  B: relates to the scrutiny and debate of laws by reasonable people.
  C: relates to the potential for bias in decision making.
  D: relates to the scope of the jury's power, including interpretation of the law.
  E: relates to the role of police and prosecutors in selecting which laws to pursue.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that jury nullification creates problems because it is not transparent, can be based on limited information or biases, and usurps the role of legislators and judges.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful tool for indicating to legislators that there may be a problem with a law and can serve as a safety valve for overzealous police and prosecutors.
  The authors of these passages would be most likely to disagree over whether jury nullification creates more problems than it solves or whether it can be a useful tool for improving the legal system.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D, it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism: 
  Although the authors of the passages may disagree about the utility of jury nullification, neither passage suggests that juries have the power to interpret the law. 
  This makes choice D an unlikely candidate for the correct answer.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  In Passage A, the author is critical of jury nullification and argues that it creates problems because juries are not required to explain their verdicts and may not have sufficient evidence to make a reasoned decision, juries are not legislators, and the use of nullification is unknown.
  In Passage B, the author is more sympathetic to jury nullification and argues that it can be a useful safety valve to address cases where prosecutors or laws may be overzealous, and can also be a way to signal to legislators that there may be problems with the law in question. 
Thought: 
  The authors of the two passages disagree about the extent to which jury nullification is a useful or problematic phenomenon.
  Passage A is critical of jury nullification and argues that it creates problems because juries are not required to explain their verdicts and may use their power for evil rather than good, and because juries are not elected and have no obligation to think through the effect of their verdicts on others. 
  Passage B is more sympathetic to jury nullification and argues that it can be a useful safety valve to address cases where prosecutors or laws may be overzealous, and can be a way to signal to legislators that there may be problems with the law in question because legislators cannot foresee every variation that may arise.
  The authors do not disagree about whether juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts (A), or whether laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people (B), or whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue (E).
  The authors do not directly address the question of whether elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are (C).
  The authors do disagree about whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it (D).
   While Passage A argues that juries are not legislators and should not have this power, Passage B argues that when juries nullify because they believe a law is unjust, they can also perform a useful function by indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question. 
Conclusion: 
  The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over the statement that "it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it." Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Passage A describes the problems with jury nullification, highlighting issues with the jury's power being unelected, unaccountable and making decisions without public scrutiny.
  - Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful function in indicating problems with the law, and implies that it is not uncommon for juries to nullify when they believe the law is unjust.
Thought: 
  The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether the problems with jury nullification outweigh any benefits it may have in helping to scrutinize and revise the law. 
  Specifically, Passage A argues against the use of jury nullification, pointing out how juries have the power to nullify without transparency or accountability, and may not have the necessary information or qualifications to make a reasoned decision about whether to nullify. 
  In contrast, Passage B argues that jury nullification can be useful if it indicates a problem with the law itself. 
  While both passages raise concerns about the use of nullification in some circumstances, they differ in their assessment of whether nullification can have positive effects, such as increasing scrutiny of the law.
  None of the options directly addresses this disagreement.
Criticism: 
  None of the options presented directly addresses the disagreement between the two passages. 
  Options A and D are both addressed by Passage A, but these do not necessarily represent points of disagreement between the passages. 
  Option E is mentioned in Passage B, but again, this does not represent a disagreement.
  Option B may seem related to the disagreement over the usefulness of jury nullification in scrutinizing the law, but neither passage takes issue with the idea that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people.
  Option C seems closest to the disagreement between the passages, since Passage A argues that elected officials are better equipped to interpret the law than jurors are, while Passage B implies that juries may be less biased in their decision making than elected officials.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The authors of Passage A and Passage B discuss the concept of jury nullification. 
  Passage A argues that jury nullification can create problems because of the power that jurors have to disregard the judge's instructions and the jury's findings of fact. The jury also lacks the necessary information and expertise to interpret the law, which is the responsibility of lawmakers and judges.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a way for juries to correct for overzealousness in law enforcement or flawed laws created by legislators. The jury's ability to nullify can provide feedback to the legislature and assist in refining laws.
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss jury nullification.
  Passage A argues that jury nullification can create problems because juries have insufficient evidence and lack legislative expertise.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be useful because it can assist the legislature and correct for overzealousness or flawed laws.
  The authors would most likely disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  Passage A argues that this is not within the purview of juries and is the responsibility of lawmakers and judges, while Passage B argues that juries can provide useful feedback to the legislature about the application of laws and can sometimes interpret the law in a way that makes sense to them.
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses jury nullification and its problems, including the lack of information on how it is used, insufficient evidence for a reasoned decision, and the idea that jurors are not legislators. 
  Passage B discusses the usefulness of jury nullification in certain situations, including when the law is too broad or unjust.
Thought: 
  The passages seem to agree that jury nullification has both positives (such as providing a safety valve and indicating potential problems with the law) and negatives (such as lack of information and insufficient evidence). 
  However, they have different focuses - Passage A is more critical of jury nullification and its problems, while Passage B is more positive and highlights its usefulness. 
  Looking at the choices, none of them directly address the different focuses of the passages. 
  A is mentioned briefly in Passage A but not really discussed in depth in either. 
  B is discussed in both, but again not in a way that the authors would necessarily disagree. 
  C is not really discussed in either. 
  D is mentioned in Passage A as something that juries should not be doing, but is not discussed in Passage B. 
  E is discussed in Passage B, but again not in a way that would necessarily indicate disagreement between the authors. 
  Therefore, I don't believe any of the choices are the correct answer. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems with jury nullification, including the lack of knowledge about how often it is used, jurors often lacking sufficient evidence to make an informed decision, and the fact that jurors are not legislators. 
  Passage B argues that nullification can serve as a safety valve when officials are overzealous, and also provides feedback to the legislature about the effectiveness and justness of laws. 
Thought:
  There is no clear disagreement between the two passages about (A) whether juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts.
  Passage B supports (B) the idea that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people, while Passage A does not necessarily disagree with this point.
  There is no clear disagreement between the two passages about (C) whether it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors.
  Passage A argues against (D) the idea that juries should interpret the law, instead arguing that their role is to apply the law.
  Passage B does not necessarily disagree with (E) the idea that police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the problems created by jury nullification, including the unknown frequency of its use and the lack of information about how juries exercise their power.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can play a useful role as a safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous and when jurors believe a law is unjust or inapplicable to a particular defendant.
Thought:
  The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether jury nullification is a problem or a useful tool.
  Passage A argues that jury nullification is problematic because of the unknown frequency of its use and the potential for jurors to use their power for evil ends rather than for good ones.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful tool when police and prosecutors are overzealous and when jurors believe a law is unjust or inapplicable to a particular defendant.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree over the usefulness of jury nullification.
  Answer("D")
Criticism:
  While it is true that the authors would likely disagree over the usefulness of jury nullification, none of the answer choices correspond to this option.
  Answer choices A and B both touch on points made in Passage A and do not relate to the disagreement between the passages.
  Answer choice C is not discussed in either passage and does not relate to the disagreement between the passages.
  Answer choice E is discussed in Passage B but does not relate to the disagreement between the passages.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes the problems created by the jury's power to nullify and argues that juries are unelected, unaccountable, and have no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. 
  Passage B argues that the power of jury nullification can be used as a safety valve and that when jurors nullify because they believe a law is unjust or the case is too trivial, they perform a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature.
Thought: 
  While both passages discuss the use of jury nullification, they have different perspectives regarding the use of this power. 
  Passage A argues that jury nullification can create problems because jurors are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision, and jurors are not legislators. 
  Passage B argues that when a jury nullifies because they believe a law is unjust or the case is too trivial, they perform a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature and can assist in guiding the lawmakers to make positive changes.
  The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it. Passage A seems to argue that jurors are not legislators and have no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others, while Passage B argues that when a jury nullifies because they believe a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature the problem with the law in question. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism: 
  There is no clear disagreement on whether juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts, laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people, or police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue. The passages do not address these issues directly, and the attitudes of the authors towards these issues are not in conflict with each other. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration
  D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
  E: Some of the refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today contain chemicals known to be environmentally damaging.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the harmful effects of CFCs on the ozone layer and the advocacy of Molina and Rowland to ban their production and use.
  A: The passage does not discuss whether other refrigerant chemicals were discovered or in use when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: The passage mentions the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals after the ban on CFCs, but it does not provide information on the number of chlorine atoms they release.
  C: The passage does not discuss the energy efficiency of CFCs.
  D: The passage states that CFCs were banned in North America in the late 1970s, not as a result of the Montreal Protocol.
  E: The passage does not provide information on the content of refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the ban on CFCs, but it does not mention any specific refrigerant chemicals or their characteristics.
  The Montreal Protocol is mentioned, but the passage does not say whether it led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
  Therefore, none of the choices are strongly supported by the information in the passage.
  If I had to choose the most likely answer, it would be B because it mentions the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals after the ban on CFCs, which is mentioned in the passage.
Criticism: 
  Based on the information in the passage, none of the choices are strongly supported, and it is unclear whether any of them are even plausible.
  Choice B is the closest to being supported, but the passage does not provide information on the number of chlorine atoms released by substitute refrigerant chemicals.
  Therefore, it would be inappropriate to select any of the choices as the answer.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the history of CFCs and their impact on the ozone layer. 
  A: The passage does not discuss the discovery of other refrigerant chemicals.
  B: The passage discusses the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals, but it does not provide a comparison of their chlorine atom emissions to those of CFCs.
  C: The passage does not discuss the energy efficiency of CFCs in comparison to other refrigeration methods.
  D: The passage indicates that CFCs were banned in North America in the late 1970s, before the Montreal Protocol was signed in 1987.
  E: The passage does not make any specific statements about refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today.
Thought:
  The passage primarily discusses the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer and the advocacy work of Molina and Rowland to address this issue.
  The passage briefly mentions the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals in response to these concerns.
  From this information, we can infer that the Montreal Protocol was likely created to address the issue of ozone depletion caused by CFCs.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the impact of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone layer, and how this was discovered by scientists Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland in the 1970s. 
  CFCs are highly volatile chemicals used in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants. 
  CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. 
  The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. 
  Molina and Rowland became advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response, which led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. 
  CFCs were banned in North America in the late 1970s, leading to the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Thought: 
  A: The passage doesn't mention any other refrigerant chemicals, so it's unclear whether others had been discovered or not. This statement is not supported by the passage. 
  B: The passage doesn't provide information about specific refrigerant chemicals developed after 1987 or the amount of chlorine atoms they release, so we cannot conclude whether this statement is true or false. 
  C: The passage does not mention anything about the energy efficiency of CFCs in refrigeration. This statement is not supported by the passage.
  D: The passage states that CFCs were banned in North America in the late 1970s, before the Montreal Protocol was developed. The Montreal Protocol was an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases, not just in North America. Therefore, this statement is not accurate. 
  E: The passage does not mention any other refrigerant chemicals in use today or whether they contain environmentally damaging chemicals. This statement is not supported by the passage. 
Criticism: 
  The options A, B, and C are all incorrect because they are not supported by the information in the passage. 
  Option D is partially incorrect because the passage states that CFCs were banned in North America in the late 1970s, but the Montreal Protocol was an international agreement to ban ozone-depleting gases. 
  Option E is also incorrect because it is not supported by the information in the passage. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  - Ozone in the stratosphere screens out the most damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
  - Molina and Rowland showed that manufactured CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  - CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  - The depletion of the ozone layer was recognized as a pressing environmental threat, leading to the Montreal Protocol of 1987 to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought: 
  From the passage, it is clear that CFCs were considered responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer as they chemically react and deplete ozone molecules. The passage indicates that CFC production should cease, to reduce the amount of CFCs in the atmosphere and ultimately halt the depletion of the ozone layer. There is no information in the passage to support that refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do. The passage does not provide any information on why CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components. The passage states that the Montreal Protocol of 1987 led to the international agreement to ban ozone-depleting gases, but it does not mention if this cessation was in North America or globally. Similarly, the paragraph referred to the transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and development of more environmentally-friendly refrigerant chemicals, but there is no information given on whether these refrigerant chemicals contain known environmentally-damaging chemicals. 
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that the Montreal Protocol led to an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone
  B: testing to see whether the chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there
  C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine
  D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine
  E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to CFCs.
  The scientists discovered that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would yield information on whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Chlorine is the chemical responsible for depleting the ozone layer.
  Therefore, an experiment that tests whether the new chemical would react with chlorine would be the most useful.
  Choice C would yield this information.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the negative impact of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  CFCs react with UV radiation and lead to the release of chlorine in the stratosphere, which attacks and depletes the ozone layer.
  This depletion of the ozone layer can lead to an increase in skin cancer rates among humans.
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  We know that CFCs react with UV radiation and lead to the release of chlorine in the stratosphere.
  Therefore, it would be useful to test whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine or not.
  If the chemical does react with chlorine, it could potentially be harmful to the ozone layer.
  If the chemical does not react with chlorine, it could potentially be a safe replacement for CFCs.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to the release of CFCs into the atmosphere.
  CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, in the stratosphere, and how the resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage explains how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, and how the breakdown of CFCs into their constituent elements, including chlorine, in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Therefore, an experiment testing whether a particular chemical would chemically react with chlorine, as CFCs do, would be most useful in determining whether that chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: 
  It is possible that there are other ways in which a chemical could damage the ozone layer besides reacting with chlorine, so testing whether a chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone, as in option A, could also be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Additionally, testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine, as in option D, could also be useful in determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. 
  However, while options A and D could be useful, option C is still the best answer, as it is the most directly related to CFCs and their chemical reaction with chlorine, which is the main cause of ozone depletion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage concerns the depletion of the ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
  Two scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, showed how CFCs cause ozone depletion.
  As a result, an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) was established to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The experiment must determine whether the chemical would be safe and not cause ozone depletion.
  Options A, B, D, and E do not directly test whether a chemical would cause ozone depletion.
  Option C would be useful because it would determine whether the new chemical would react with chlorine, which was shown to cause ozone depletion.
  Therefore, the most useful experiment would be testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
  The answer is C.
Criticism: 
  The reasoning is logical, and option C is a good choice for determining whether a chemical would be safe to replace CFCs.
  However, it is possible that other experiments could also be helpful in determining the safety of a replacement chemical.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Ultraviolet radiation from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  A thin layer of ozone screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere, 10 to 25 miles above the earth's surface.
  Exposure to manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) can chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, reducing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  CFCs are volatile chemicals that were used in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants.
  Two freon gases were studied by Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, and when released into the lower atmosphere, these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere, break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine.
  The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
Thoughts:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Option A, testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone, is not relevant to the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  Option B, testing to see whether the chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there, is also not relevant to the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  Option C, testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine, is important because CFCs break down into chlorine in the stratosphere, which leads to the depletion of the ozone layer. Therefore, it is important to ensure that a replacement chemical would not have the same effect.
  Option D, testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine, is not as important as testing whether the replacement chemical would chemically react with chlorine.
  Option E, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, is also important because CFCs break down into their constituent elements when subjected to ultraviolet radiation. It is important to ensure that a replacement chemical would not have the same effect.
Criticism:
  Options C and E both address important characteristics that a replacement chemical should have, but it is unclear which one would be more useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. 
  CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. 
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
Thought:
  To determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, we need to test the chemical's properties.
  The chemical needs to be able to achieve its intended purposes without depleting the ozone layer.
  Based on the passage, the most useful experiment to test the chemical would be to see whether it would chemically react with chlorine, as CFCs break down into constituent elements, including chlorine, and the resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the harmful effects of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone layer and how they lead to ozone depletion.
  Molina and Rowland's research showed how CFCs deplete the ozone layer by releasing chlorine atoms, which then react with ozone to destroy it.
  Any replacement for CFCs should not have a similar chemical reaction with ozone.
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  CFCs damage the ozone layer by releasing chlorine atoms that react with ozone to destroy it.
  A useful experiment would be one that determines if a replacement chemical would have a similar chemical reaction as CFCs.
  Choice C suggests testing whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine, which would be a useful experiment to determine if a chemical has a similar chemical reaction as CFCs.
  Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
  CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone in the stratosphere.
  CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which reacts with ozone to destroy it.
  Molina and Rowland were advocates for a public policy response to protect the ozone layer.
Thought: 
  The question is asking about which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  CFCs deplete the ozone layer by releasing chlorine, which reacts with ozone to destroy it.
  In order to determine if a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, we would need to test if the chemical would react with chlorine.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the harmful effects of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone layer in the stratosphere. 
  Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland were the two Nobel Prize-winning scientists who provided evidence for this damage. 
  CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which chemically react with ozone and damage the ozone layer. 
  An international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) was reached to ban the production of CFCs to prevent further damage to the ozone layer. 
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. 
  Since CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which is harmful to the ozone layer, it would be useful to test whether the new chemical would also react chemically with chlorine. 
  If the chemical does not react with chlorine, it may be a suitable replacement for CFCs. 
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: 
  Although testing the chemical to see if it reacts with chlorine could be useful, it is not the only factor to consider when determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. 
  It is important to consider other chemical properties of the new chemical and its constituent elements as well. 
  Additionally, testing to see whether the chemical would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation could also be a useful experiment to determine its potential impact on the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the damage to the ozone layer caused by the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
  Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage discusses how CFCs attack and deplete the ozone layer by chemically reacting with chlorine atoms.
  Therefore, testing to determine whether a chemical would chemically react with chlorine would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage discusses how CFCs attack and deplete the ozone layer by chemically reacting with chlorine atoms, thereby suggesting that testing to see whether a chemical would chemically react with chlorine would be useful.
  However, other factors could be relevant in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  For example, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation (answer choice E) could also be useful, as this would help determine whether the chemical would contribute to ozone depletion.
  Therefore, C is a possible answer, but E could also be considered a valid answer.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science.
  Popper maintained that negative evidence has more power than positive evidence.
  Popper claimed that a single black swan can disprove the hypothesis that all swans are white.
  Popper also claimed that scientific research involves searching for evidence that would disprove bold theories.
  Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. 
  
  Passage B discusses the discovery of the planet Uranus.
  Astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that there were no planets in the vicinity of Uranus.
  The predictions were incorrect, and the astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets.
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they later discovered and called Neptune.
  Later, astronomers predicted the orbit of Mercury, and the predictions were not borne out.
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet called Vulcan, but it was never found.
Thought: 
  Passage A describes disturbing forces as one of the "auxiliary" premises used to derive a theory's predictions.
  Passage B describes how astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that there were no planets in the vicinity of Uranus.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, hypothesizing the existence of another planet called Neptune.
  The discovery of Neptune helped bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, Neptune was not a disturbing force.
  None of the other answer choices fit the criteria of a disturbing force.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that none of the answer choices fit the criteria of a disturbing force.
  However, there is no need to use the information from passage A to answer the question.
  The answer can be found purely within passage B.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A focuses on Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science.
  According to Popper, negative evidence is more powerful than positive evidence in scientific research.
  Scientists derive a theory's predictions based on auxiliary assumptions and other theories.
  When a prediction fails, there is usually more than one possible explanation.
  Positive evidence is never conclusive.
  Negative evidence rarely is either.
  Passage B describes the attempts of astronomers to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions in the prediction of Uranus's orbit was that no planets existed in its vicinity.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions when their predictions were found to be incorrect.
  The discovery of Neptune fit with their revised assumptions.
  The hypothesis of the existence of another planet in the prediction of Mercury's orbit was never confirmed.
Thought: 
  The question asks about which choice in Passage B clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in Passage A.
  The passage does not give a clear definition of a disturbing force.
  Based on the context of Passage A, a disturbing force could be considered an additional premise that affects the outcome of a scientific prediction.
  The auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets could be considered disturbing forces in the prediction of Uranus's orbit.
  In the prediction of Mercury's orbit, the disturbing force could be an error in Newton's laws or an unknown planet that was never confirmed.
  Therefore, the answer is either B: the sun, C: Neptune, or D: Mercury because each one of them could be related to additional premises that affect the outcome of their predictions.
Criticism: 
  The answer cannot be A: Uranus because it is the planet being predicted, not an additional premise that affects the outcome of the prediction.
  The answer cannot be E: the moon because it is not mentioned in either passage and is not related to the predictions of Uranus or Mercury.
  Based on the context of Passage A, the definition of a disturbing force could be broadened to include any additional premise, not just the ones related to the mass and orbits of other planets.
  Therefore, the answer could be any planet or celestial body mentioned in Passage B, as well as any unknown force affecting the predictions.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the power of negative evidence in the scientific research.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus, predictions based on Newton's laws, and the discovery of Neptune and Mercury.
  The passage B also mentions auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets.
Thought:
  Passage A talks about auxiliary or other premises that are essential assumptions in deriving a theory's predictions.
  In passage B, one of the auxiliary assumptions that astronomers made while predicting the orbit of Uranus was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  However, the observation showed that the predicted orbit was incorrect.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets and concluded that another planet must be close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  The planet, later on, was discovered and named Neptune.
  This change in auxiliary assumption about the existence of another planet which changed the prediction of Uranus's orbit can be considered as a kind of disturbing force.
  Therefore, Neptune could be the answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's philosophy of science and the power of negative evidence.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and later predictions of the orbit of Mercury based on Newton's laws and auxiliary premises.
  Disturbing forces are mentioned in Passage A as one of the possible auxiliary premises that may affect predictions.
Thought: 
  The question asks which one of the options in Passage B most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in Passage A.
  To answer this question, we need to understand what is meant by the term "disturbing force", which is defined in Passage A as an auxiliary premise that may affect predictions along with other theories, instrumentation, etc.
  Uranus, the sun, Neptune, Mercury, and the moon are all mentioned in Passage B, but none of them are explicitly mentioned as a disturbing force.
  However, the discovery of Neptune is given as an example of how modifying an auxiliary premise (i.e., the assumption that no planets existed near Uranus) can lead to correct predictions.
  Thus, similar to a disturbing force, Uranus's presumed lack of nearby planets affected predictions about its orbit.
  The discovery of a new planet (Neptune) changed the original auxiliary premise and improved the accuracy of the predictions.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism: 
  There is a flaw in the thought process used to answer the question, as it conflates the concept of a disturbing force with that of an "auxiliary premise."
  In Passage A, disturbing forces are described as factors that can affect predictions along with other auxiliary premises and theories, but they are not synonymous with a modifier of auxiliary premises such as those employed by the astronomers trying to predict the orbit of Uranus.
  Therefore, while the reasoning used to arrive at the answer is not completely incorrect (the discovery of Neptune is related to the modification of an auxiliary premise), it is not the strongest evidence to support the conclusion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, concerning the power of negative evidence and his belief that negative evidence is at the heart of scientific research.
  Passage B discusses astronomers' attempts to predict the orbit of Uranus and later Mercury, based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and other planets, and how the predictions were not borne out, leading to new assumptions and discoveries.
Thought: 
  Passage A describes how disturbing forces are a type of additional "auxiliary" premise that scientists need to take into account when deriving a theory's predictions.
  Passage B discusses astronomers' attempts to predict Uranus and Mercury's orbit using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and other planets. When the predictions were not borne out, they hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which could be a disturbing force affecting the orbit of the planet, and later discovered Neptune in the precise position it would have to be to account for the discrepancy in their calculations.
  Therefore, Neptune is the answer that most clearly illustrates a disturbing force as described in passage A.
  The answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant flaw in the answer provided.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's philosophical contribution to the power of negative evidence.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and the subsequent discovery of Neptune, and how astronomers used auxiliary assumptions to predict orbits.
  Disturbing forces are mentioned in Passage A as one of the possible additional "auxiliary" premises scientists need to consider when deriving a theory's predictions.
Thought: 
  The question asks which of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in Passage A.
  In Passage B, astronomers made predictions about Uranus' orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and other planets.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  This assumption turned out to be false, as they discovered the planet Neptune in the precise location their calculations predicted.
  This discovery of an unknown planet in the vicinity of Uranus is most likely a disturbing force, as it disrupted their calculations and predictions.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism: 
  The answer is a plausible interpretation, but there are other premises in Passage B that could also be considered disturbing forces, such as the discovery of Mercury's anomalous orbit, which led some scientists to question Newton's laws.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's philosophy of science.
  The use of negative evidence is central to Popper's philosophy.
  Passage B gives examples of the use of auxiliary premises to determine the validity of scientific theories.
  Theories rarely entail predictions on their own; auxiliary premises are used to derive predictions.
  When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation.
Thought: 
  Passage A uses the example of disturbing forces, which are auxiliary premises that can lead to failed predictions despite the validity of a theory.
  Passage B describes how astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of planets using auxiliary premises and Newton's laws.
  The astronomers found that their predictions were incorrect, and one possible explanation was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions.
  This is a situation where a disturbing force might be present.
  The question asks which of the options illustrates a disturbing force.
  None of the options refer to an auxiliary assumption, so none of them directly illustrate a disturbing force.
  However, given the context of the passage, the most likely answer is D: Mercury, since the incorrect prediction of its orbit led scientists to hypothesize the existence of Vulcan, an auxiliary premise.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not identify any of the options as a disturbing force, since none of them are auxiliary premises.
  While the incorrect prediction of Mercury's orbit is related to the use of auxiliary premises, the option itself does not illustrate a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science and the power of negative evidence.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and attempts to predict its orbit using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  Astronomers found that their predicted orbit was incorrect due to the existence of another planet, Neptune, that they had not accounted for.
  Similar attempts to predict the orbit of Mercury also failed until Einstein's theory of relativity was used instead of Newton's laws.
Thought: 
  Passage A describes "disturbing forces" (line 26) as one of the possible "auxiliary" premises that can cause a theory's predictions to fail. 
  In Passage B, the attempts to predict the orbit of Uranus were based on auxiliary assumptions about other planets in the vicinity. 
  The discovery of Neptune revealed that this auxiliary assumption was incorrect and that there was, in fact, another planet present that was disturbing Uranus's orbit.
  Therefore, Neptune best illustrates a "disturbing force" in this context.
  The answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in Passage B that Neptune's presence was considered a "disturbing force" by the astronomers. 
  It is possible that the astronomers were uncertain about the existence of another planet and simply made an incorrect assumption. 
  Therefore, while the discovery of Neptune may have been unexpected and caused their predictions to fail, it may not necessarily fit the definition of a "disturbing force" as described in Passage A.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Popper's views on negative and positive evidence, as well as the need for auxiliary premises in scientific predictions.
  Passage B provides examples of the use of Newton's laws for scientific predictions, as well as the role of auxiliary premises and the discovery of new phenomena.
  The term "disturbing forces" refers to external factors that may affect the accuracy of scientific predictions.
Thought: 
  The question asks for an example of a disturbing force, which is described in passage A.
  According to passage A, auxiliary premises can affect the accuracy of scientific predictions.
  In passage B, the astronomers made predictions about the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Therefore, the presence of another planet near Uranus is the example of a disturbing force in this scenario.
  The correct answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in passage B that the presence of Neptune was a "disturbing force."
  The astronomers' observations of Uranus were not affected by the presence of Neptune; rather, the discovery of Neptune led to a revision of the auxiliary assumptions used in the prediction of Uranus's orbit.
  A more accurate answer to the question might be "None of the above," since the term "disturbing force" is not used in passage B.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's theory of negative evidence and how scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them.
  Passage B discusses the attempts by astronomers to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The passage mentions that when predictions failed, one possible explanation was an error in the auxiliary assumptions involving disturbing forces.
Thought: 
  The question is asking which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force.
  A, B, C, and D are all astronomical bodies mentioned in Passage B, but none of them are specifically described as a disturbing force.
  The moon is not mentioned in the passage at all.
  Therefore, none of the options in the question match the definition of a disturbing force provided in Passage A.
  None of the above is the most likely answer.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct that none of the options in the question match the definition of a disturbing force provided in Passage A.
  However, the question is asking for the option that most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, not matches the definition of one.
  Therefore, it is possible that one of the options could be the correct answer if it is described as a disturbing force in Passage B but not referred to as such.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred that the aulbor would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?
Choices:
  A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model ofpub1ishing will be uuiikely to remain economically competitive.
  B: The primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers aud haudheld devices for reading text.
  C: The growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business.
  D: Any book will sell more copies ifit is published digitally thau if it is published traditionally.
  E: Digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The author argues that the digital model of publishing is likely to eventually replace or rival traditional publishing due to its economic efficiency and convenience. This model would involve the printing and binding of books on demand at point of sale by machines and the elimination of physical book inventory and related costs. The author also suggests that literary agents may demand a larger share of revenue for their authors under this model.
A: The author does not explicitly state this, although it is possible based on the argument presented.
B: The author does not suggest this. In fact, the author argues that the capacity for instantaneous transmission and retrieval of digital text is a key benefit of digital publishing.
C: The author does not address this possibility.
D: The author does not make this claim. The argument is focused on the economic efficiency and convenience of digital publishing, rather than its potential to increase book sales.
E: The author does not address this possibility.
Thought: 
The author is advocating for the advantages of the new digital model of publishing and arguing that traditional publishers may be reluctant to embrace it due to their heavy investment in the infrastructure of traditional publishing. The author also suggests that literary agents may be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds under this model and that traditional publishers may need to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors.
Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that the author would agree with statement A: "Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive."
Criticism: 
There is no explicit statement in the passage to confirm that the author would agree with statement A. While the author does argue that the digital model of publishing is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing, it is unclear whether the author believes that traditional publishers who fail to embrace the new model will necessarily become economically uncompetitive.

  The author argues that digital publishing will likely replace or at least rival traditional publishing due to its economic efficiency and convenience for customers. 
  At the same time, the established publishing houses that are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing will be reluctant to accede initially. 
  Therefore, upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure will be the first to bid for new manuscripts. 
  Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. 
  Therefore, it can most reasonably be inferred that the author would agree with the statement that "Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive."
  The other statements are not supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The author believes that most digitized files of books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines, and this will make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. 
  Digital publication involves no physical inventory and eliminates the costs of warehousing, shipping, displaying and returning unsold books, rendering digital publishing more efficient than traditional publishing. 
  Literary agents believe that under the digital publishing model, authors would be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds, as many costs of traditional publishing are eliminated.
Thought:
  The author favors the new digital model of publishing over traditional publishing, as digital publishing is more efficient and cost-effective. The author also states that upstart digital-publishing firms would be more likely to embrace this model earlier on, compared to established publishing houses that are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing. Any publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model may be at risk of being left behind and may lose authors. 
  Therefore, the author would most reasonably agree with the statement that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive. 
  The other statements are not supported by the information provided.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the advantages of digital publishing over traditional printing methods.
  The author predicts that digital publishing will eventually supplant or rival traditional publishing.
Thought:

  Therefore, it can be inferred that those publishers who fail to transition to digital publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
  The answer is A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:

  The author also thinks that the efficiency and convenience of digital publishing will likely lead to its eventual dominance over traditional publishing.
Thought: 
  The author argues that traditional publishers will initially be reluctant to embrace digital publishing, and may lose out in the long term if they do not adapt to the new model. Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that the author would agree with the statement that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
  The other options are not supported by the passage. The author does not suggest that the use of computers and handheld devices will impede the growth of digital publishing (B), that digital publishing will revitalize the book retail business (C), that any book will sell more if published digitally (D), or that digital publishing will allow publishers to decrease advertisement spending (E).
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the economic efficiency and convenience of the new digital model of publishing versus the traditional model. 
  The author argues that once most books have been digitized, anyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practically limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been designated "out of print."
  The author suggests that digital publishing will eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing, although it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to justify investment in book printing machines at numerous regional sites.
Thought: 
  The author argues that the new digital model of publishing will be more economically efficient and convenient for customers than the traditional model.
  The author suggests that publishers who do not embrace the new digital model are unlikely to remain economically competitive. 
  The author does not suggest that the primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers and handheld devices for reading text. 
  The author does not suggest that digital publishing will revitalize the book retail business.
  The author does not argue that any book will sell more copies if it is published digitally than if it is published traditionally.
  The author does not suggest that digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.
  Therefore, the author would most reasonably agree with statement A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive. 
Criticism: 
  The author does not explicitly state that publishers who fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing are "unlikely" to remain economically competitive, but instead suggests that traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. 
  Therefore, while the author may agree with the general sentiment of statement A, the wording of the statement may be too strong.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that digital publishing is likely to become more popular and eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing due to the economic efficiency and convenience of the digital model.
  Additionally, the author suggests that once most books have been digitized, anyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practically limitless digital catalog.
  Literary agents may demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors under the digital publishing model, due to the elimination of whole categories of expense.
Thought:
  It can most reasonably be inferred that the author would agree with the statement that suggests those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
  The author provides evidence that the digital model is more economically efficient and convenient, and that anyone with access to the internet will be able to purchase printed books. Thus, publishers who fail to embrace this new model may struggle to compete with those who do.
  Therefore, the most reasonable answer is A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that the growth of digital publishing will make traditional publishing less competitive.
  The author notes that digital files of books will likely be printed on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in factories.

  Therefore, those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing are unlikely to remain economically competitive.
  The answer is A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
Criticism:
  The author argues that the growth of digital publishing will make traditional publishing less competitive, but the argument does not necessarily suggest that digital publishing will lead to the revitalization of the book retail business or that any book will sell more copies if it is published digitally than if it is published traditionally. Additionally, the argument does not address the amount of money publishers will allocate for advertising their books under digital publishing.
Action: Answer("A")

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

Choices:
  A: illustrate the relation between proverb use and education about peer-group relationships in Mexican American communities

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position in Russian literary criticism, which went deeper than the radical view that literature must find its sources in concrete reality and contribute to building a new society. Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality and that reality was far more than the merely tangible. He believed that literature's crucial source was reality but that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. He thought that art must stand or fall on its artistic merit, not its utility.

Thought: 
  The question asks what can be inferred from the passage about Dostoyevsky's view of the position that art should stand high above the present and the everyday. The passage states that Dostoyevsky took a third position in literary criticism. The passage further notes that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was far more than the merely tangible and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. This suggests that he would not have agreed with the position that art should stand high above the present and the everyday because he believed that reality was more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.

Criticism: 
  None.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Dostoyevsky had a unique understanding of reality and literature.
  He believed that reality was not just the tangible but also included the fantastic.
  The radical critics believed that art should only depict reality and serve a particular political view.
Thought:
  The statement that some Russian critics held that "art should stand high above the present and everyday" means that art should be divorced from reality.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source of literature but that it went beyond the tangible.
  Therefore, he would disagree with the idea that art should be divorced from reality.
  The answer is not A or D because Dostoyevsky believed that reality included the fantastic, but not that it was the only or most important element of art.
  The answer is not B because Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source of literature, but that it was more than just a list of mundane details.
  Dostoyevsky believed that art should not be useful in a utilitarian sense, so he would disagree with the idea that art should further some societal end.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's views on literature and art.
  Dostoyevsky took a realist approach to literature, but believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it.
  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was not acceptable for Dostoyevsky.
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear was a contradiction in terms for Dostoyevsky.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it and that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  He believed that the task of a writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Therefore, he would most likely disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  This is because such a view prioritizes the fantastic and abstract over the real and tangible, which is not in line with Dostoevsky's belief that reality is literature's crucial source.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
Criticism: 
  Your interpretation is correct, as Dostoyevsky's emphasis on the importance of reality in literature would logically lead him to disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's view on two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position and believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, and for him, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky might disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  The answer is D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Criticism: 
  The passage mentions that Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  However, there is no clear indication that Dostoyevsky would disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  Therefore, the answer may not be D.
Action: Answer("D") 
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is discussing Dostoyevsky's position on the role of art in society and literature.
  Dostoyevsky rejected the idea that art should serve a particular political view or be "useful" to society.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but he understood reality to be deeper than the merely tangible and to include the fantastic.
  Dostoyevsky defined "artistic merit" as the ability to write well and to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader fully understands the author's thoughts.
Thought:
  The passage does not provide a direct answer to the question.
  However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky may have agreed with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday, because he believed that reality was not limited to the tangible and that the fantastic was intimately bound up with the real.
  Therefore, it is possible that Dostoevsky would have agreed with statement A or statement B.
Criticism: 
  While it is possible that Dostoevsky would have agreed with statement A or statement B, the passage does not provide a clear answer to the question.
  The passage suggests that Dostoevsky rejected the idea that art should be "useful" to society or serve a particular political view, which would contradict statement E.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on literary criticism in Russia during his time.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was a crucial source of literature, but that it could be deeper than the tangible reality. 
  He believed that the distinction between fantasy and reality was not important.
  Dostoyevsky rejected the idea that literature should serve a particular political view or be "useful" to society.
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's position on reality and literature is that reality is a crucial source of literature, but that it can be deeper than the tangible reality.
  The view that art should stand high above the present and everyday is not rejected by Dostoyevsky.
  Dostoyevsky believes that the distinction between fantasy and reality is not important, so the view that art should have a strong element of the fantastic is not rejected by Dostoyevsky.
  Dostoyevsky rejects the idea that literature should serve a particular political view or be "useful" to society, so the view that art should further some societal end is incorrect according to Dostoyevsky.
  The statement that reality must be the foundation of all literature conflicts with Dostoyevsky's understanding of literature as being deeper than tangible reality. 
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would most likely agree with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday because of its recognition that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Dostoyevsky considered reality to be literature's crucial source.
  He believed that reality was far more than the tangible and was shaped by the person who experienced it.
  He rejected the idea that reality should be depicted "as it is," believing that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the real world.
  He rejected the radical critics' insistence that literature should be useful to society or have a particular political view.
  Dostoyevsky defined artistry as "the ability to write well" and the talent to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader fully understands the author's thoughts.
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky rejected the radical critics' belief that art should stand high above the present and everyday, or be useful to society.
  He believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it, and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that he would consider this view incorrect because it fails to understand the deeper meaning of reality.
  Choice B that the view recognizes that reality is more than just mundane details of life aligns with Dostoyevsky's belief about reality.
  The other choices do not align with Dostoyevsky's views on literature, reality, and artistry.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position regarding the two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during his time.
  One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that literature should be useful.
  Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source.
  For Dostoyevsky, reality was far more than the merely tangible, and there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky's view is a middle ground and not aligned with either of the two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  Reality was far more than the merely tangible, and there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  A work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
  Therefore, Dostoevsky would most likely disagree with the statement that art should stand high above the present and the everyday because he believed that reality should be at the foundation of literature.
  So, the answer is C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct. 
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality should be at the foundation of all literature and had no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. 
  Therefore, he would most likely disagree with the position that art should stand high above the present and the everyday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a realist position in Russian literary criticism.
  One position maintained that art stood high above present and everyday reality, while another position maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality.
  The radical view maintained that literature should be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but he also believed that reality went beyond the tangibles.
  Dostoevsky believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it, and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Dostoevsky believed that artistry was the ability to write well and that literary works must stand on their own artistic merit.
  Dostoevsky disagreed with the radical critics' requirement that art must be useful to people and society.
Thought:
  The passage states that Dostoevsky took a third position in Russian literary criticism, and that he saw reality as literature's crucial source.
  He believed that a writer's task was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world and that artistry was the ability to write well.
  He disagreed with the radical critics' requirement that art must be useful to people and society.
  Therefore, Dostoevsky would most likely have disagreed with the statement that art should stand high above present and everyday reality.
  This eliminates choices A and B.
  Dostoevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, so choice C is also eliminated.
  Dostoevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, which eliminates choice D.
  This leaves only choice E, which is consistent with Dostoevsky's belief that art should not be required to serve a particular political view or be useful to society.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky's position on Russian literary criticism was different from the positions of the two opposing directions of the time.
  One of the opposing positions maintained that art should be high above the present and the everyday.
  Dostoyevsky was a realist, who believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but that reality was more than just the tangible.
  For Dostoyevsky, the fantastic was not superfluous to a writer's concerns.
Thought: 
  The passage presents Dostoyevsky's thoughts on the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was more than just the tangible and that the fantastic was not superfluous to a writer's concerns.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky might have disagreed with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday, as it might not allow for the exploration of the fantastic and the deeper aspects of reality.
  Choice A is incorrect as it emphasizes only one aspect of Dostoyevsky's position and doesn't address the issue at hand.
  Choice B is a more accurate statement of Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality but doesn't address the issue at hand.
  Choice C is incorrect as it contradicts Dostoyevsky's belief that reality was literature's crucial source.
  Choice D is a more accurate statement of Dostoyevsky's position, but it doesn't address the issue at hand.
  Choice E is a more accurate statement of Dostoyevsky's position as he disagrees with the utilitarian claim that art must serve a particular political view or be useful to society.
Criticism: 
  Choice B is more accurate than Choice E in describing Dostoyevsky's position on reality, but neither of these choices address the issue at hand, which is Dostoyevsky's view of the idea that art should stand high above the present and everyday.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: The author most likely lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings (lines 38–43) primarily to

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the strategy of "stealing thunder" in the courtroom.
  Stealing thunder involves revealing negative information about one's own client before it can be revealed by opposing counsel.
  The effectiveness of stealing thunder has not been directly studied in actual trials, but studies in simulated trial situations suggest that it can be effective.
  Several psychological explanations are offered for why stealing thunder might be effective, such as creating an image of credibility and alerting jurors to upcoming testimony.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the effectiveness and potential limitations of the strategy of stealing thunder in the courtroom.
  The author suggests that stealing thunder can be effective in certain situations, and that there are psychological explanations for why this might be.
  The author also notes that there are limitations to the strategy, particularly when the information being revealed is too negative or readily available.
  The main point of the passage is that: "Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors."
  Therefore, the answer is C.
Criticism:
  The other answer choices all contain some element of the main ideas discussed in the passage, but they do not accurately capture the main point.
  Answer A discusses the effectiveness of stealing thunder, but does not emphasize the psychological explanations for its effectiveness or the limitations of the strategy.
  Answer B discusses the potential unintended consequences of stealing thunder, but does not emphasize the underlying psychological mechanisms that make the strategy effective.
  Answer D discusses the risks and benefits of stealing thunder in general terms, but does not accurately capture the nuanced discussion presented in the passage.
  Answer E suggests that research has directly confirmed the usefulness of stealing thunder and identified its limitations, but the passage notes that no direct research into the effectiveness of the strategy in actual trials has been conducted.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the courtroom strategy of "stealing thunder," which involves a lawyer revealing negative information about their own client before the opposing lawyer has a chance to bring it up. The author discusses why lawyers may use this technique and how it may affect jurors. The author notes that research has suggested the technique is effective to a certain extent.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is to explain the courtroom strategy of "stealing thunder," provide reasons why lawyers may use it, and discuss the potential benefits and limitations of the technique based on psychological research. 
  Answer A is incorrect because the passage does not state that the effectiveness of stealing thunder has been demonstrated in actual trials; it only discusses research conducted in simulated trial situations. 
  Answer B is too specific in its focus on unintended consequences and does not fully capture the breadth of the passage's discussion of the technique. 
  Answer D is too absolute in its statement that the risks always outweigh the benefits when the information is too negative or readily available. The passage notes that the weight of the evidence should be considered before deciding to use the technique. 
  Answer E is incorrect because it suggests that the research confirms the usefulness of stealing thunder. While the passage notes that the technique is effective to some extent, it does not provide a definitive conclusion about its overall usefulness.
Criticism:
  While answer C captures the key points made in the passage, it may be overly broad in its assertion that the belief in the value of stealing thunder is "commonly held" by lawyers. The passage notes that "many lawyers" believe it can be beneficial, but it does not establish how widespread this belief is.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that discretionary nonenforcement can be a technique used to reduce the costs of overinclusion in law enforcement. 
  The passage also suggests that capricious enforcement is not a central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Capricious enforcement is defined in the passage as enforcement that is arbitrary or unpredictable.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement is enforcement that is arbitrary or unpredictable.
  The passage argues that capricious enforcement is not the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, if capricious enforcement occurs, it most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  Your logic is correct. Capricious enforcement is defined in the passage as enforcement that is arbitrary or unpredictable. 
  The passage also suggests that capricious enforcement is not the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, if capricious enforcement occurs, it most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  There does not seem to be any criticism of your answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that discretionary nonenforcement is a technique used to reduce the costs of overinclusion of the rules of laws, which are almost always overinclusive. 
  The agency's use of discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases.
  Capricious enforcement is not unknown or rare, but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement is enforcement that is done arbitrarily or impulsively. 
  Passage A suggests that capricious enforcement is not unknown but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is most likely the result of not prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes or understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Criticism: 
  It is not entirely accurate to say that capricious enforcement is the result of not prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes or not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law.
  Capriciousness implies that enforcement is arbitrary or impulsive regardless of the damage caused or the intent of the law.
  Therefore, the correct answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the technique of discretionary nonenforcement that can be used by law enforcement agencies to reduce the costs of overinclusion in laws without increasing underinclusion.
  Passage A suggests that discretionary nonenforcement does not necessarily mean capricious enforcement.
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement (line 32) is the enforcement of the law without a clear principle of selection. 
  According to Passage A, discretionary nonenforcement reduces the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion.
  Capricious enforcement would not have a principle of selection, so it is unlikely that it would be focused on areas of conduct brought within the scope of the law by accident.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is most likely not prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes.
  Capricious enforcement may or may not understand the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law, but this is not explicitly suggested in Passage A.
  Capricious enforcement is more likely to involve not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  Therefore, the answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains why law enforcement agencies often decline to prosecute some violators of particular laws, which is discretionary nonenforcement. This technique reduces the costs of overinclusion of overinclusive rules without increasing underinclusion. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. Capricious enforcement is not unknown but does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  The passage does not explain other methods of law enforcement, such as enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible, prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes, not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement, as defined in Passage A, is enforcing the law in a way that is unpredictable, impulsive, or arbitrary. 
  Capricious enforcement is not the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced. 
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is most likely the result of not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that capricious enforcement involves enforcing the law in a way that is unpredictable, impulsive, or arbitrary. 
  However, the passage does not specifically state that capricious enforcement is the result of not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law. 
  The passage suggests that capricious enforcement is not the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced. 
  Therefore, it may be difficult to determine the exact cause of capricious enforcement from the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the technique of discretionary nonenforcement; which means that law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws or particular applications of law by declining to prosecute violators. 
  Capricious enforcement could occur, but legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced.
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement refers to a situation where there is arbitrary or inconsistent enforcement of the law without any legitimate reason. 
  Passage A suggests that legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is unlikely to occur as a central tendency.
  Therefore, none of the choices accurately describes capricious enforcement.
Criticism:
  Your answer does not match the question. 
  Option E says that capricious enforcement means that the law is not being enforced according to the intent of the legislature. 
  However, Passage A suggests that legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is unlikely to occur as a central tendency.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that law enforcement agencies can nullify particular laws by declining to prosecute violators.
  This is because rules of law are almost always overinclusive, meaning they forbid conduct the legislature did not intend to forbid.
  Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs, like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one.
  Discretionary nonenforcement is a technique by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced, without increasing underinclusion.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement is described as being "not unknown (or even rare)" (line 32).
  Capricious enforcement involves taking random or arbitrary actions that lack any consistent principle, which does not sound like prioritizing enforcement according to the amount of damage caused or enforcing according to the legislature's intent.
  From the context of the passage, it seems more likely that capricious enforcement involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law, or not understanding the difference between the letter and intent of the law.
  The passage also states that legislative oversight ensures that the law enforcement agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is likely to involve an agency straying from legislative oversight and acting arbitrarily or inconsistently in its enforcement.
  So, the answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A describes how law enforcement agencies can nullify particular laws or applications of the law by declining to prosecute violators.
  Passage A explains how allowing discretionary nonenforcement of certain laws can help reduce the social costs associated with overinclusive rules.
  Passage A notes that capricious enforcement of the law is not unknown, but it is not the central tendency, as legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement is enforcement of the law that is unpredictable and subject to whim rather than based on established policy or standards.
  Passage A notes that capricious enforcement is not the central tendency and legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is most likely when there is no legislative oversight, and enforcement of the law is unpredictable and subject to the agency's whim rather than based on established policy or standards.
  The answer is not A, B, C, or D.
  E is a possible answer because capricious enforcement could involve not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism:
  Capricious enforcement is not necessarily the result of not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  Capricious enforcement could be the result of not having established policy or standards for enforcing the law, or having unpredictable enforcement of the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses discretionary nonenforcement as a technique for reducing the costs of overinclusion in laws.
  The danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of discretionary nonenforcement since the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it.
  Capricious enforcement is not unknown but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the law enforcement agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement is mentioned as an instance of discretionary nonenforcement that does not follow the intended regulation being enforced.
  Capricious enforcement appears to deviate from the intended regulation without justification or reason.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  There is no reference in the passage that capricious enforcement involves not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law, so D is incorrect.
  A is incorrect because capricious enforcement does not appear to be a matter of limited resources.
  C is incorrect because the passage does not discuss prioritizing enforcement according to the amount of damage caused by crimes.
  B is too specific, as discretionary nonenforcement can be exercised for reasons other than following the legislature's intent.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that law enforcement agencies can selectively nullify particular laws or applications of law by declining to prosecute violators.
  Passing a law almost always entails creating a rule that is overinclusive, i.e., which forbids conduct that the legislature did not mean to forbid. Precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language.
  Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs.
  The technique of discretionary non-enforcement can be used to reduce the costs of overinclusion while keeping the amount of loopholes to a minimum.
  Capricious enforcement is not unknown, but it is not likely to be the central tendency of a law enforcement agency.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement (line 32) means enforcing the law according to arbitrary whims or personal biases unrelated to the intent of the legislature in passing the law.
  Passage A suggests that discretionary non-enforcement is the technique that law enforcement agencies use to reduce the costs of overinclusion while keeping the amount of loopholes to a minimum.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement would represent the opposite of discretionary non-enforcement, which means that capricious enforcement implies not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. Capricious enforcement would imply that the law enforcement agency is not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law. 
  None of the other answer choices is consistent with the definition of capricious enforcement presented in Passage A.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how law enforcement agencies can nullify particular laws by declining to prosecute violators, and how rules of law are almost always overinclusive, creating the danger of punishing the innocent if the rule is enforced literally.
  It suggests that discretionary nonenforcement can reduce the cost of overinclusion without increasing the risk of underinclusion.
  Capricious enforcement is not unknown but is less likely to be a central tendency, and legislative oversight assures that law enforcement agencies do not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement can be understood as arbitrary or unpredictable enforcement of the law.
  Passage A suggests that discretionary nonenforcement can reduce the costs of overinclusion, without increasing the risk of underinclusion.
  It also suggests that legislative oversight assures that law enforcement agencies do not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement would most likely involve not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism:
  Your answer is correct. 
  There is no indication in the passage that capricious enforcement would involve only enforcing the law to the degree that municipal resources make possible (A), prioritizing enforcement according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes (C), or not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law (D).

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of the economic principle of utility maximization in the crime deterrence debate.
  The principle of utility maximization is the idea that rational individuals choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
Thought:
  The question is asking which scenario is most similar to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  Legal scholars are using an economic principle to analyze the decision to commit a deliberate crime as a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, we are looking for an answer choice where an individual in a particular field uses a principle from another field to analyze a phenomenon.
  Option A refers to an astronomer using a paradox; this is not relevant to the passage.
  Option B refers to a drawing instructor using a law of optics from physics; this is not relevant to the passage.
  Option C refers to a botanist using a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete; this is not relevant to the passage.
  Option D refers to a judge using evidence from anthropology; this is not relevant to the passage.
  Option E refers to a mediator using a short quotation from a well-known novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct; this is not relevant to the passage.
  None of the answer choices are similar to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  As a result, the most likely answer would be Option E, as it appears to be the most unrelated.
Criticism:
  While none of the answer choices provided are a perfect match to the description of legal scholars using the utility maximization principle to analyze the crime deterrence debate, Option E is not the most likely answer because it is not relevant.
  Even though the answer choices are not a perfect match, the question is asking for the closest similarity.
  The passage gives a clear description of legal scholars using an economic principle to analyze the choice to commit a deliberate crime as a rational economic choice, and the answer should be related to this.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of the economic principle of utility maximization to analyze the decision-making process of individuals when it comes to committing crimes.
  A: This choice describes an astronomer's use of a metaphor from ancient cosmology to describe a recently observed phenomenon.
  B: This choice describes a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other.
  C: This choice describes a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest.
  D: This choice describes a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a legal case.
  E: This choice describes a mediator's use of a short quotation from a novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the use of the economic principle of utility maximization to analyze the decision-making process of individuals when it comes to committing crimes.
  To help reconcile two opposing views on the most effective crime deterrence methods, some legal scholars have used the utility maximization principle to suggest that both views are complementary.
  This implies that the use of the utility maximization principle is a way to bridge a gap between two opposing theories.
  None of the choices seem to relate to the use of a specific principle to reconcile two opposing views.
  Therefore, none of these choices match the scenario described in the passage.
  None of the above is the most likely answer.
Criticism: 
  The question does not ask for a scenario that matches the passage word for word.
  It asks for a scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle.
  While the passage describes how the utility maximization principle can be used to reconcile two opposing views, it does not describe the use of a principle to bridge a gap between two opposing theories.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the utility maximization principle as a means of analyzing individual decision-making related to committing a crime.
  The principle involves determining the expected utilities of the possible outcomes of an action and weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's occurrence.
Thought:
  The question is asking which scenario is most similar to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  The principle involves taking a concept from one field (economics) and applying it to another (criminal law).
  Therefore, the answer will involve a scenario in which a principle from one field is used to explain or support a concept in another field.
  A, B, C, and E all involve the use of a concept from one field to explain or illustrate a concept in another, but none of them involve the use of a principle from one field to support or justify a concept in another field.
  D involves the use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a legal case, which is similar to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle to support their position in the crime deterrence debate.
Conclusion:
  The correct answer is D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how legal scholars are using the economic principle of utility maximization to reconcile two positions on the deterrence of deliberate crimes.
  A: This choice involves an astronomer using a paradox as a metaphor and is not related to the passage's discussion of crime deterrence.
  B: This choice involves a drawing instructor using a law of optics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other and is not related to the passage's discussion of crime deterrence.
  C: This choice involves a botanist using a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest and is not related to the passage's discussion of crime deterrence.
  D: This choice involves a judge using evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case, which is an example of using outside knowledge to inform legal decisions.
  E: This choice involves a mediator using a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session.
Thought:
  The passage discusses how legal scholars are using the economic principle of utility maximization to reconcile two positions on the deterrence of deliberate crimes.
  None of the other choices involve the use of an outside principle to inform legal discourse.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of the economic principle of utility maximization in the debate over crime deterrence.
  A: This answer choice describes the use of a paradox to explain a phenomenon.
  B: This answer choice describes the use of a law of optics to demonstrate a concept.
  C: This answer choice describes the use of a quotation to make a point about competition.
  D: This answer choice describes the use of evidence from anthropology to support a legal decision.
  E: This answer choice describes the use of a quotation to set a tone of collegiality at the start of a bargaining session.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the use of utility maximization to analyze the decision to commit a crime.
  The utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The use of the utility maximization principle is similar to the use of a legal principle or framework to support a legal argument.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, or E.
  While D involves the use of another field (anthropology) to support a legal decision, it is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a debate in the legal community over how to deter deliberate crimes.
  One side believes that societal norms and institutions influence individuals to commit crimes, while the other side believes it is an individual's choice.
  The passage introduces an economic principle of utility maximization, which analyzes an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
Thought:
  Some legal scholars use the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  The economic principle of utility maximization analyzes an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, legal scholars who use the utility maximization principle believe that crime is a choice made by rational individuals.
  This is similar to legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice.
  The scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle is legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice.
  Answer: D
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of the economic principle of utility maximization to reconcile two opposing views on how to deter deliberate crimes. 
  A: The use of a paradox by ancient cosmologists is not related to the use of utility maximization to reconcile differing views on crime deterrence.
  B: The use of a law of optics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other is not related to the use of utility maximization to reconcile differing views on crime deterrence.
  C: The use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest is not related to the use of utility maximization to reconcile differing views on crime deterrence.
  D: The use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case is not related to the use of utility maximization to reconcile differing views on crime deterrence.
  E: The use of a short quotation from a well-known novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session is not related to the use of utility maximization to reconcile differing views on crime deterrence.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the use of utility maximization to reconcile two differing views on how to deter deliberate crimes. 
  None of the answer choices relate to the use of utility maximization in this context.
  Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above". 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two positions on the crime deterrence debate.
  The passage introduces an economic principle of utility maximization.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the utility maximization principle helps to reconcile the two positions on the crime deterrence debate, demonstrating that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  Based on the passage, the use of the economic principle is to demonstrate how both positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  Therefore, the scenario most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate is most similar to a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other, as it illustrates how two seemingly different things can actually complement each other. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle to analyze the deterrent effect of different crime prevention methods.
  A: The use of an ancient metaphor by an astronomer to explain a new phenomenon is not related to the use of economic principle.
  B: The use of a law of physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other is not related to the use of economic principle.
  C: The use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete by a botanist to make a point about the competitive nature of plants is not related to the use of economic principle.
  D: The use of evidence from anthropology by a judge to support a decision in a controversial legal case is not related to the use of economic principle.
  E: The use of a short quotation from a well-known novel by a mediator to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session is not related to the use of economic principle.
Thought:
  The question asks for a scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  The passage explains how the utility maximization principle can be used to analyze the deterrence effect of different crime prevention methods.
  Therefore, the answer should be a scenario in which an economic principle is used to analyze a problem.
  Only option A is related to a metaphor, but it is not related to economic principle.
  Option B, C, D, and E are not related to the use of economic principle.
  None of the options is a good fit.
Criticism:
  This question seems to be a bit unclear as to what it is asking. The passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle to analyze the deterrence effect of different crime prevention methods, but the question asks for a scenario that is most similar to this use. However, the options provided are not related to economics or the use of economic principle. As such, no option seems to be a good fit for the question.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that some legal scholars are using the utility maximization principle to show that the two positions on crime deterrence are complementary.
  A: The scenario involves an astronomer's use of a paradox from ancient cosmologists to describe a recently observed phenomenon.
  B: The scenario involves a drawing instructor's use of an optical law from physics to explain that two lines that appear to diverge are actually parallel.
  C: The scenario involves a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympian to make a point about the competitive nature of plants.
  D: The scenario involves a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a legal case.
  E: The scenario involves a mediator's use of a quotation from a well-known novel to set a tone of collegiality in a bargaining session.
Thought: 
  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle is being used by some legal scholars to show that the two positions on crime deterrence are complementary.
  None of the scenarios presented in the choices are related to law or the crime deterrence debate.
  Therefore, none of the choices are similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the passage.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists conducted experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The experiment led to the production of puzzling radioactive substances.
  The researchers did not recognize that they were splitting atoms.
  In 1939, Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection and recognized that the researchers were splitting uranium atoms.
Thought: 
  The researchers did not recognize that they were splitting atoms because they had strong expectations that the products would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  If the researchers did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, then they might have more easily recognized that they were splitting atoms.
  Therefore, choice B is the most likely answer.
Criticism: 
  There is not enough information to determine the degree to which the researchers' expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products contributed to their failure to recognize that they were splitting atoms.
  Other factors, such as the difficulty of working with highly radioactive materials and the dangers associated with it, may have also played a significant role.
  Therefore, choice B is a plausible but not necessarily definitive answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of nuclear fission.
  It took several years for physicists to understand what they were seeing.
  Lise Meitner made the crucial theoretical connection to explain the experimental results.
Thought:
  The question is asking which of the following would most likely have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  A: If the physicists were using the same research techniques, it would not necessarily have any impact on how long it took for them to realize they were witnessing nuclear fission.
  B: If the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the nuclear composition of the by-products, it is possible that they would have realized what they were witnessing earlier. However, it is not clear how much of an impact this would have had.
  C: If the physicists were aware of the calculations indicating in principle it was possible to split atoms, they may have realized what they were witnessing earlier. This seems like a plausible answer, but it is not clear how much of an impact this would have had.
  D: If more physicists had concentrated on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium, it is possible that they would have realized what they were witnessing earlier. This seems like a plausible answer, but it is not clear how much of an impact this would have had.
  E: If physicists had conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium, it would not necessarily have any impact on how long it took for them to realize they were witnessing nuclear fission.
Criticism: 
  There is no clear answer to the question based on the information in the passage. 
  While some of the answers seem reasonable, it is not clear which would have had the greatest impact on reducing the amount of time it took for physicists to realize they were witnessing nuclear fission.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists conducted experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
  They amassed increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  However, they did not recognize what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
Thought: 
  The question asks which option would reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Option A implies that using the same research techniques would somehow speed up the process of discovery. However, there is no reason to believe this is true.
  Option B suggests that if the physicists did not have any expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they would have been less biased in their observations and may have recognized the significance of the by-products sooner. This option seems plausible.
  Option C suggests that if physicists were not aware of the theoretical calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms, they would have missed the significance of the by-products. This option seems unlikely since the theoretical calculations were not directly related to the experimental results.
  Option D suggests that more physicists focusing on obtaining experimental results would have speeded up the discovery. Again, there is no reason to believe that this is true.
  Option E suggests that if physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium, they would have recognized the significance of the by-products sooner. This option seems unlikely since the by-products were related to the neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Option B seems most plausible.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists discovered nuclear fission between 1934 and 1939.
  Some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to split atoms even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  Experimental physicists that conducted neutron-bombardment experiments on uranium compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided a crucial theoretical connection and recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
Thought:
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection and recognition of the significance of the data.
  Therefore, if physicists had understood more about the theory of splitting atoms, they might have recognized the significance of their data with less delay.
  Thus, if physicists had been aware of the theoretical calculations indicating that it should be possible to split atoms, they might have made the connection more quickly.
  Choice C expresses this idea.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists discovered nuclear fission by bombarding uranium with neutrons.
  Between 1934 and 1939, researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
  Meitner recognized that researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  Meitner coined the term "nuclear fission" and published her conclusion in a paper coauthored with physicist Otto Frisch.
Thought: 
  Physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not recognize what they were witnessing. 
  Physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  Therefore, if physicists had been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms, they might have recognized what they were witnessing earlier.
  The answer is C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide direct support to suggest that having the same research techniques (A), not having particular expectations regarding the by-products (B), or concentrating on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium (D) would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  While it is possible that conducting experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium (E) could have led to different conclusions, the passage does not provide support for this statement. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The discovery of nuclear fission was not immediately recognized by scientists, despite accumulating evidence.
  Between 1934 and 1939, increasing evidence of nuclear fission was compiled.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that led to the recognition of nuclear fission.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, and quickly submitted her conclusion for publication.
Thought:
  Physicists took a long time to recognize the evidence of nuclear fission despite accumulating evidence. 
  To reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split, it would have been helpful to have a factor that encouraged recognition.
  If the physicists were all using the same research techniques (A), it may have made recognition more difficult, rather than reducing the amount of time it took.
  If the physicists had not been aware of the calculations indicating it was possible to split atoms (C), it would not have necessarily been helpful in reducing the amount of time it took to recognize the evidence.
  Having more physicists concentrate on obtaining experimental results (D) could have helped, but may not have been sufficient to reduce the amount of time it took to recognize the evidence.
  If the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the byproducts (B), this could have helped in reducing the amount of time it took to recognize the evidence. With fewer assumptions, the physicists may have been more open to recognizing what they were seeing.
  It is unclear whether experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium (E) would have been helpful in reducing the amount of time it took to recognize the evidence.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Criticism: 
  It is possible that having more scientists concentrate on obtaining experimental results (D) could have led to more evidence that nuclear fission was occurring, which could have helped in the recognition of nuclear fission.
  However, without a change in mindset among the scientists, having more evidence may not have led to recognition of nuclear fission.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists conducted experiments between 1934 and 1939 in which they bombarded uranium with neutrons and compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Prior to the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei being experimentally demonstrated, theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Researchers were not receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection to nuclear fission in 1939 when she recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
Thought: 
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but they did not recognize it because they were not receptive to the possibility that it might happen in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments.
  More physicists concentrating on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium might have meant that someone would have recognized the significance of the data before Lise Meitner.
  Therefore, D is the most likely answer.
Criticism: 
  While more physicists concentrating on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium might have meant that someone would have recognized the significance of the data before Lise Meitner, it is also possible that more data would have only made the situation more confusing, given that the existing data was not being correctly interpreted.
  Additionally, it is unclear how the other answer choices would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists conducted experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium, which led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The discovery of nuclear fission was not immediate because researchers did not recognize what they were witnessing, and the by-products were not identified.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection and coined the term "nuclear fission."
Thought:
  The question asks which answer choice, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques. - This answer choice is not directly related to the discovery of nuclear fission, so it does not provide a solution.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products. - This answer choice is plausible. If the scientists had not expected the by-products to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition, they may have been more open to the possibility that something more significant was happening.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms. - This answer choice is also plausible. If the physicists had been aware of the calculations, they may have been more open to the possibility that they were splitting atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium. - This answer choice is not likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split, as it does not address the core issue of misinterpreting the data.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium. - This answer choice is also plausible. If physicists had been experimenting with other substances and observed similar results, they may have been more likely to realize that atoms were being split.
  Both answer choices B and C seem plausible.
Criticism: 
  It is possible that more than one answer choice would have reduced the amount of time it took to discover nuclear fission, and other factors not mentioned in the answer choices may have been more significant.
Action: Answer("B") or Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the process of realizing that atoms were being split.
  The discovery of nuclear fission was the result of a series of experiments that began in 1934 and ended with the realization of what was happening in 1939.
  Physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
Thought:
  The problem was not that physicists were unable to obtain experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium. They had achieved numerous similar results but had not realized what they were witnessing.
  The problem was also not that physicists were not using different research techniques.
  The problem was not that physicists were not aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  The problem was that physicists had particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  If the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they might have realized what they were witnessing more quickly.
  Therefore, B is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Physicists took several years to realize that they had achieved nuclear fission when conducting neutron-bombardment experiments on uranium.
  Theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  Physicists conducting the experiments had not been receptive to the possibility of breaking atoms through neutron-bombardment experiments.
  In 1939, Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
Thought:
  Physicists conducting the experiments were not receptive to the possibility that they might split atoms through neutron-bombardment experiments, even though theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Therefore, if the physicists were aware of the theoretical calculations, they would have been more receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Three positions are presented and each is elaborated in detail.
  B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
  C: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the second in detail.
  D: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be superior to the first two.
  E: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be inferior to the second.

Therefore, the best answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage presents and discusses three positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  These positions are:
    - Art stands high above the present and the everyday.
    - Art should find its sources in concrete reality, and through the exposure of want and injustice, it should contribute to the creation of a new society.
    - Reality is literature's crucial source, and reality goes deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  The passage focuses on Dostoyevsky's position, which is the third one presented.
Thought:
  The passage presents three positions in Russian literary criticism.
  The third position is discussed in more detail and is presented as Dostoyevsky's position.
  The radical critics' position is contrasted with Dostoyevsky's position.
  The passage does not show that one position is superior or inferior to the others.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Three positions are presented, and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
The most accurate description of the organization of the material presented in the passage is:
Option B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. 

Explanation:
The passage presents three significant and opposing positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time. The first position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that literature should be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society. The third position taken by Dostoyevsky is then introduced, which is a realist position that goes deeper than the other two positions. The third position is differentiated from the first two in detail. The passage discusses how Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went beyond the radical critics' view, and how reality was far more than the merely tangible. The passage also elaborates on Dostoyevsky's definition of artistic merit and his rejection of the utilitarian claim that art must serve a particular political view. The passage does not suggest that the third position is superior or inferior to the other two; rather, it explains how the third position is different from the other two. Therefore, the best answer is option B.
Response 3:
Answer: B
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage discusses three positions regarding literature and its relationship to reality. The first two positions are opposing and the third position is presented as different from the first two.
Thought: 
  The passage presents three positions on literature: 
    1. Art is above the present and everyday
    2. Art should be useful, and contribute to creating a new society
    3. Reality is the crucial source of literature, but reality goes deeper than what radical critics maintain. There's no distinction between fantasy and reality; reality exists beyond the merely tangible. The writer's task is to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  The third position is presented as different from the first two, as the passage states that Dostoyevsky took a "third position."
  The third position is not presented as superior or inferior to the first two, but rather as different from them.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that the third position is differentiated from the second, so the answer cannot be C.
  The third position is not presented as superior or inferior to the first two, so the answer cannot be D or E.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
The answer is B: Three positions are presented, and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. The passage presents three opposing positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoevsky's time: one position maintained that art was above the present and the everyday, the second view held that literature should be useful and expose want and injustice, and the third, which was Dostoevsky's, held that reality was literature's crucial source and that reality went deeper than what the radical critics believed. The passage then goes on to elaborate on Dostoevsky's position and how it differed from the first two positions. Therefore, the third position is differentiated from the first two in detail.

  Dostoyevsky's position is that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the radical critics'.
  He believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it and that the fantastic must be intimately bound up with the real.
  He believed that artistic merit was the most important aspect of a literary work and rejected the radical critics' requirement that art must be useful to people and society.
  Therefore, the organization of the material presented in the passage is option B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Criticism: 
  There are three positions presented in the passage, but it is not accurate to say that each position is elaborated in detail.
  The first two positions are briefly mentioned and contrasted with Dostoyevsky's position.
  The third position is Dostoyevsky's and is differentiated from the first two positions in detail.
  Therefore, the answer option B is the most accurate.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses three different viewpoints on the purpose and role of literature.
  The first position argues that art should be separate from everyday life.
  The second position argues that literature should be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society.
  The third position, held by Dostoyevsky, argues that reality is the basis for literature, but reality is not limited to the tangible and can include the fantastic.
  Dostoyevsky also rejects the idea that literature must be useful to society.
Thought:
  The passage presents three different positions on the role of literature.
  The first two positions are presented, but the third position is given more detail and explained in depth.
  Dostoyevsky's position is described as a mediator between the first two positions, but it is not presented as superior or inferior to either.
  Therefore, the best description of the organization of the material presented is that three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
  The answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Criticism:
  There is no indication in the passage that Dostoyevsky's position is presented as superior or inferior to the other two positions.
  Therefore, option D and E are incorrect.
  While the third position is explained in more detail than the first two, all three positions are elaborated to some extent.
  Therefore, option A is not completely accurate.
  However, option B accurately reflects the fact that the third position is differentiated from the other two in more detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The first position maintained that art was above everyday reality.
  The second position maintained that art should only exist if it found its source in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society.
  The third position, held by Dostoyevsky, maintained that reality was literature's crucial source, but that reality went deeper than just the tangible, and that the writer's task was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
Thought: 
  The passage presents three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The third position, held by Dostoyevsky, is differentiated from the first two positions in detail.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage presents three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  However, the third position is differentiated from the first two positions in detail, not just the second.
  So, the correct answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage discusses three positions on the role of literature and art: one that emphasizes that art should be above the everyday, one that maintains that art should be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society, and Dostoyevsky's position which goes deeper than the radical critics in understanding reality and argues that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit" and that the demand that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
Thought: 
  The passage presents three positions on the role of literature, but the focus is on Dostoyevsky's position and how it differs from the first two positions. There is no indication that Dostoyevsky's position is superior or inferior to the other positions.  
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Criticism: None.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A is discussing evolutionary psychology, which seeks to explain human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior.
  Evolutionary psychologists seek to identify psychological experiences of identification and empathy that could have increased the chances of related individuals receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy.
  Psychological states provoked by physical resemblance could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy.
  That would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or may not be aware of.
  The author of Passage A discusses how genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, which would qualify as a behavior that the agent of the behavior may not be aware of.
  Therefore, assertion D most clearly exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and its approach to studying human behavior.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology, calling it a "conspiracy theory" because it imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of.
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses the idea that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother rushing to help her injured child.
  This assertion exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" because it attributes a hidden interest (the proliferation of genes) to behavior that is otherwise viewed as selfless.
  The author of Passage B is criticizing evolutionary psychology for proposing that genes are the ultimate cause of behavior, rather than acknowledging other possible motives.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. 
  In Passage A, the author suggests that behaviors that appear altruistic may actually be motivated by an interest in gene propagation.
  This is an example of how evolutionary psychology can be seen as a "conspiracy theory" because it proposes an underlying motive for behavior that is not always apparent.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains how evolutionary psychology examines human behavior with respect to the theory of evolution.
  It highlights the problem of explaining the evolution of altruistic behavior.
  The passage then suggests that genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
Thought: 
  The assertion that genes promoting their self-propagation may operate through actions that appear unselfish is the most clear example of what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory.
  This is because evolutionary psychologists explain behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of.
  The example of genes promoting their self-propagation through apparently unselfish actions fits this description.
  Therefore, the answer is D: "Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish."
Criticism: 
  The assertion that genes promoting their self-propagation may operate through actions that appear unselfish is consistent with the view that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory, but it is not the most clear example of what the author of passage B means.
  A more clear example may be the entire concept of examining human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution.
  By imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) to explain behavior, evolutionary psychology may be seen as a conspiracy theory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and its explanation of human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint.
  The author argues that altruistic behavior may arise due to the promotion of genes responsible for identification and empathy.
  Passage B describes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory that imputes an interest (gene propagation) to human behavior that the agent does not openly acknowledge or may not be aware of.
Thought: 
  The author of passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory because it imputes an interest to human behavior that the agent is not aware of, such as the promotion of genes responsible for identification and empathy.
  Among the options, D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory". 
Criticism: 
  The explanation of genes promoting their own self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish is not a conspiracy theory as it is supported by scientific evidence.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A is discussing how evolutionary psychology explains human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution.
  Passage A discusses the evolution of altruistic behavior and how it may have arisen in human ancestors in response to cues and psychological experiences of identification and empathy.
  Passage A explains how genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" and explains that it imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of.
Thought: 
  Passage B suggests that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it implies that our behavior is driven by an interest in propagating our genes, even if we are not aware of it.
  The notion that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish is an example of how evolutionary psychology could be seen as a conspiracy theory.
  Choice D most clearly exemplifies the author of passage B's argument that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A explains evolutionary psychology and how it examines human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for being a conspiracy theory that imputes an interest to behavior.
Thought:
  Passage B critiques evolutionary psychology.
  The author of Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
  A conspiracy theory is a theory that explains behavior by imputing an interest that is not openly acknowledged.
  The assertion in Passage A that best exemplifies what the author of Passage B means is that genes may promote self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This is because it shows how evolutionary psychology imputes an interest (self-propagation of genes) to apparently unselfish behavior.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct. 
  The answer is well supported by the text. 
  Good job.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology explaining human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing hidden interests to the agents of behavior.
Thought: 
  Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" because it imputes hidden interests to human behavior. 
  From passage A, genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  Therefore, the assertion from passage A that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish is the most clear example of what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
  The answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct and accurately reflects what the passages say. 
  The choice you selected is the best answer to the question. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and its explanation of human behavior.
  Passage B argues that evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory because it imputes an interest to the agent of the behavior that the agent may not be aware of.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage B is critical of evolutionary psychology because it imputes an interest to the agent of the behavior that may not be apparent.
  Passage A describes how genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother's rushing to help her injured child.
  This assertion illustrates the point made in Passage B that evolutionary psychology is like a conspiracy theory, as it attributes unspoken interests to agents of behavior.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains the concept of evolutionary psychology, which studies human behavior to explain how it contributes to the reproduction of genetic material.
  Passage A suggests that seemingly unselfish actions may actually be a result of genes promoting their own self-propagation.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology as being a kind of conspiracy theory because it imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior is not aware of.
Thought: 
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory.
  Conspiracy theories suggest that there is a hidden motive behind an action or event.
  Therefore, the assertion that most clearly exemplifies the characterization of evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory is one that suggests a hidden motive behind an action.
  The assertion in Passage A that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish most clearly exemplifies the characterization of evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains the theory of evolution in relation to human behavior.
  The author suggests that related individuals' receiving assistance from one another can increase the chances of their survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology, stating that it is a kind of conspiracy theory that imputes interests to the agent of the behavior that they are not aware of.
Thought:
  To answer the question, we need to find the assertion in Passage A that most closely exemplifies what the author of Passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
  The author of Passage B suggests that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it imputes an interest to the agent of the behavior that they are not aware of. 
  The assertion in Passage A that best exemplifies this is the statement that "genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish" (lines 15-16). 
  This assertion suggests that an individual's seemingly unselfish behavior may actually be motivated by genes that are seeking to promote their own survival and replication. 
  This fits with the idea that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it suggests that the agent of the behavior is not aware of the true motivation behind their actions.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the study of Native American autobiographies and argues that scholars have limited themselves to as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The passage introduces the term "bicultural composite authorship" without a clear definition, but implies that it is related to the limited focus of scholars who study Native American autobiographies.
Thought:
  The passage implies that bicultural composite authorship relates to written autobiographies of Native Americans.
  Scholars limit themselves to studying autobiographies that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  Bicultural composite authorship likely refers to the collaboration between Native American narrators and non-Native American collaborators.
  The collaboration results in a written autobiography in which the contributions of both the Native American narrator and the non-Native American collaborator are blended together.
  The term "composite" suggests that the final product is a combination of the two cultures.
  The term "bicultural" suggests that the collaboration involves two distinct cultures.
  The term "authorship" suggests that the final product is a written work that is attributed to the narrator.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" means that a written Native American autobiography was produced through a collaboration between Native American narrators and non-Native American collaborators, resulting in a final product that is a blend of both cultures.
  Answer("D")
Criticism:
  The passage itself does not define the term "bicultural composite authorship," so some interpretation is needed.
  While the passage implies that the term is related to the limited focus of scholars on written autobiographies, it does not focus solely on written works; it also discusses traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  The term "composite" does suggest a blending of cultures, but it is not clear that the final product is a blend of both cultures; it could be that only the non-Native American collaborator's culture is represented in the written work.
Action:
  Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the study of autobiographies of Native Americans.
  Scholars have focused on written life histories that were recorded and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The scholars have overlooked traditional modes of communicating personal history.
Thought:
  "Bicultural composite authorship" is a phrase used in line 5.
  The passage explains that most scholars have focused on written life histories that were recorded and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  "Bicultural" means involving two cultures.
  "Composite" means made up of various parts or elements.
  "Authorship" refers to the fact that the written life histories were created by someone.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" means that the written life histories were created through the involvement of two cultures and made up of various parts or elements.
  Option B presents the most accurate meaning of "bicultural composite authorship."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the focus of most scholars on written as-told-to life histories of Native Americans.
  The scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  "Bicultural composite authorship" is mentioned as a characteristic of the written as-told-to life histories.
Thought:
  Scholars have focused on written as-told-to life histories of Native Americans.
  These written histories are created through "bicultural composite authorship."
  "Bicultural composite authorship" involves collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native American collaborators.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase as used in the passage.
  The answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism:
  The thought process is incorrect.
  "Bicultural composite authorship" involves collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native American collaborators, not between two people of different cultures.
  Therefore, the answer is not B.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of existing studies on Native American autobiographies, and points out the exclusive focus on "as-told-to life histories" that were created through a process of "bicultural composite authorship".
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used in line 5 to describe the creation process of "as-told-to life histories"
Thought: 
  The passage defines "bicultural composite authorship" as the process through which "as-told-to life histories" were created.
  "As-told-to life histories" are written accounts of Native American autobiographies that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" describes the collaborative process between Native American autobiographers and non-Native American collaborators.
  The correct answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism: 
  The thought process is correct and accurately describes the meaning of "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholarly studies of Native American autobiographies, which have largely focused on written as-told-to accounts edited by non-Native American collaborators. 
  The scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history that were more inclusive and community-oriented, rather than individualistic. 
  The passage introduces the term "bicultural composite authorship" to describe the collaborative process of creating written autobiographies. 
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the process of creating written autobiographies by a collaboration between individuals from two different cultures. 
  The resulting written document is a composite of both cultures. 
  The collaboration involves soliciting, translating, recording, and editing the life history by non-Native American collaborators. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism: 
  Option A is incorrect because it talks about artifacts and oral traditions but the passage only discusses written documents.
  Option B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the two contributors contribute equally. 
  Option C is incorrect because the identities of the writers are known and they are collaborators from two different cultures.
  Option E is incorrect because the passage does not mention oral communication between collaborators. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholars' studies of Native American autobiographies and how they were produced.
  "Bicultural composite authorship" is mentioned in line 5 as a specific type of autobiography that scholars have focused on.
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a specific type of autobiography.
  Scholars have focused on this type of autobiography.
  The passage criticizes scholars for only studying this type of autobiography and ignoring other traditional ways of communicating personal history.
  The meaning of "bicultural composite authorship" must relate to the way that this type of autobiography is produced.
  Thinking about the meanings of each word, "bicultural" suggests two cultures, "composite" suggests something made up of different parts, and "authorship" suggests the process of writing or creating a work.
  So, "bicultural composite authorship" likely means that the autobiography is created by two or more people from different cultures working together to produce the final product.
  Option B most accurately reflects this meaning.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the ways in which traditional Native American modes of autobiography have been overlooked by scholars who have focused solely on written, as-told-to life histories. 
  "Bicultural composite authorship" is mentioned in line 5 as the type of life histories that most scholars have studied, which were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to as-told-to life histories that were created collaboratively by people from two different cultures.
  The phrase does not seem to refer to life histories that were written based on artifacts or oral traditions, nor does it refer to compilations of writings from people of different cultures without regard to their identities.
  The phrase also does not seem to refer to life histories that were written by one person and then edited or revised by another person.
  So, the best answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The thought process is accurate in interpreting the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as referring to as-told-to life histories created collaboratively by people from two different cultures.
  However, the answer choice B suggests that each person contributes in the same way to the finished product, which is not explicitly stated in the passage.
  The passage only describes non-Native American collaborators soliciting, translating, recording, and editing the life histories, but it does not provide information about the extent to which Native American collaborators may have been involved in the process.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the study of Native American autobiographies.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used in line 5 and suggests that these autobiographies were created through collaborative efforts between Native Americans and non-Native Americans.
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe the collaborative nature of the creation of Native American autobiographies.
  Option B describes a situation where two people from different cultures each contribute equally to a finished product.
  This accurately describes the collaborative nature of bicultural composite authorship.
  Therefore, B is the best answer.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholars who have studied Native American autobiographies;
  Scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators;
  The scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history;
  The ideas of self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of autobiography are different in some Native American cultures than they are in European cultures;
  The European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime is different from the pre-contact Native American culture's expression of life experiences, which tended to be oriented toward current events and involved the participation of fellow tribal members;
  Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life;
  Dance and drama could convey personal history;
  Artifacts such as tattoos, shields, robes, and tepees were autobiographical expressions;
  
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the fact that:
  scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  These collaborators were members of European culture, while the subjects of the autobiographies were Native Americans.
  Therefore, the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the fact that the writing of Native American autobiographies was a collaboration between members of two different cultures.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the autobiographical modes of communication of Native Americans and how scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history by focusing exclusively on written autobiographies.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the written life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators and emerged from bicultural composite authorship.
Thought:
  The term "bicultural composite authorship" in line 5 refers to a collaboration between Native American writers and non-Native American editors in which the editors have significant influence over the finished product.
  There are two parts to "bicultural composite authorship": the involvement of non-Native American collaborators and the fact that the finished product is a composite of different cultural perspectives.
  Option A is incorrect because it refers to a collaboration between two different cultures, but this does not necessarily involve the editing process that is key to "bicultural composite authorship."
  Option B is incorrect because it suggests that each collaborator contributes equally, but the passage implies that non-Native American collaborators had significant influence over the finished product.
  Option C is incorrect because it is not supported by the passage.
  Option D correctly describes the involvement of non-Native American editors in shaping the autobiographies, but it does not fully capture the idea of the finished product being a composite of different cultural perspectives.
  Option E is incorrect because it only refers to oral communication and does not include the involvement of non-Native American editors.
Criticism:
  The thought process is accurate and identifies the involvement of non-Native American editors in shaping the autobiographies as well as the idea of the finished product as a composite of different cultural perspectives, but it does not fully capture the sense that the editors had significant influence over the finished product.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: According to the passage, Dunham's work in anthropology differed from that of most other anthropologists in the 1930s in that Dunham

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon
  C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  D: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to introduce the main topic to be discussed
  E: to introduce the main topic to be discussed to present a view that will be argued against
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the paradox of happiness and wealth, mentioning the phenomena of habituation and rivalry that push up the norm of income, and the importance of relative prosperity for happiness.
  Passage B discusses why earning more makes people happier, explaining that relative prosperity makes people feel successful, and the importance of the desire to create value for happiness and society.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in both passages to support the importance of relative prosperity for happiness.
Thought: 
  Passage A mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for the phenomenon of rivalry and the importance of comparing oneself to a reference group for happiness.
  Passage B mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for the importance of relative prosperity for happiness.
  Therefore, the authors of passage A and passage B mention the Solnick and Hemenway study for different reasons: passage A to support the phenomenon of rivalry, and passage B to support the importance of relative prosperity.
  The pair that accurately describes why the authors mention the study is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Criticism: 
  The pair B could be more accurate if it specified that passage A presents a view (the phenomenon of rivalry) that will be argued against by passage B (the importance of relative prosperity), rather than a general view that will be argued against.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the paradox of happiness and wealth. It talks about the phenomena of habituation and rivalry and explains how they push up the norm of income. It also mentions the study by Solnick and Hemenway to show how people tend to compare themselves with others to determine their happiness.
  Passage B provides an alternative explanation to the phenomenon of happiness and wealth. It argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful and they have created value. It mentions the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for this explanation and to argue against the popular theory that people are only interested in one-upmanship.
Thought:
  Passage A mentions the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for the fact that how people compare to their reference group is crucial for happiness. It shows that people tend to choose a lower income as long as it is higher than their reference group's income. 
  Passage B mentions the study by Solnick and Hemenway to argue against the popular theory that people are only interested in one-upmanship. It shows that people are happy when they feel successful and that they have created value, not just when they have a bigger house than their neighbors.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B respectively mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon and to argue against a popular theory.
  The answer is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Criticism:
  There are some differences in how each passage uses the Solnick and Hemenway study. 
  Passage A uses the study to show how people tend to compare themselves to others to determine their happiness, while Passage B uses the same study to argue against a popular theory.
  However, the overall idea is still the same. Both passages use the study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon and to argue against a popular view.
  Therefore, the answer is still B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss the relationship between happiness and wealth and provide different perspectives on it.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in both passages. 
  A: The Solnick and Hemenway study describes how people choose between different income levels based on their position relative to others.  
  B: The Solnick and Hemenway study is used to argue that people care about creating value and feeling successful rather than just having more than others.
Thought: 
  Passage A uses the Solnick and Hemenway study to argue that people's happiness depends on their relative position. People are happy when they perceive themselves as having more than others.
  Passage B uses the Solnick and Hemenway study to argue that people's happiness depends on their perception of success, rather than just having more than others. People are happy when they feel that they have created value.
  Both passages provide different explanations for why people are happier with more wealth.
  Therefore, the authors mention the Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for different explanations of the same phenomenon.
  The best answer is C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided.
Criticism:
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is not mentioned to introduce the main topic to be discussed, so answer choice D is incorrect.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is not mentioned to present a view that will be argued against in either passage, so answers A and E are incorrect.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.
  B: It serves as the author's logical conclusion from data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development.
  C: It forms part of a speculative hypothesis that the author presents for its interest in relation to the main topic rather than as part of an argument.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy
  D: conviction that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives
  E: eagerness to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases

  The author argues that judgments about voluntary/involuntary risks can be misguided and may not serve as a useful guide for policy-making.
Thought:
  The author argues against relying on judgments of voluntariness for guiding policy decisions.
  The author suggests that the government should attempt to save as many lives as possible, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Therefore, the author's attitude is skeptical about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
  The answer is C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the different attitudes of experts and laypeople towards risks, and the difficulties in distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary risks.
Thought: 
  The author presents a critical perspective on the use of laypeople`s intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy. 
  The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. 
  Therefore, it is difficult to rely on the notion of voluntariness to guide regulatory policy. 
  The author concludes that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness, and that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Therefore, the author's attitude in the passage can be described as C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The author discusses the distinction between voluntarily and involuntarily incurred risks and their relationship to policy decisions. The author points out that the notion of voluntariness is often ambiguous and influenced by personal biases, and argues that policy decisions should be guided by a better understanding of the underlying factors that influence judgments about risk.
Thought: 
  The author seems to be critical of using the notion of voluntariness as a basis for policy decisions about risk. The author argues that such judgments are often influenced by biases and that policy decisions should be based on a better understanding of the underlying factors that influence judgments about risk. 
  The answer is C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage talks about the difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Laypeople tend to care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily while policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake. The author thinks that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. The author also thinks that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.

Thought: The author believes that laypeople's intuitions are not reliable as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy and that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." The author thinks that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.

Criticism: The author does not express chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities. The author is also not concerned that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation. The author is skeptical about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy, but this is not the author's overall attitude in the passage. The author does believe that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives, but this is not the author's overall attitude in the passage. The author is not eager to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion or selective attention, and are of little utility in guiding policy decisions. The government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should not be justified by invoking notions of voluntariness but rather by identifying the specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Thought: 
  The author is critical of the idea that judgments about risk should be based solely on notions of voluntariness and argues that such judgments are often based on confusion or selective attention. The author suggests that policy decisions should be based on saving as many lives as possible given the limited resources available, and on identifying specific considerations beyond voluntariness that might justify departing from this principle. 
  The author's tone is skeptical and critical, rather than eager to persuade the reader. 
Therefore, the answer is C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border
  B: a study focusing on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
Response 0:

  The passage suggests that researchers fear companies patenting biological materials may restrict access to research materials and charge high fees to use patented materials.
  The passage also suggests that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate, and researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
  Patent litigation is expensive and usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  There has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Therefore, it is likely that the researcher will not be held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued, especially if the research is basic, noncommercial research.
  The passage does not suggest that the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use or that the corporation will offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
  The university that employs the researcher will likely not prohibit the research, as the passage suggests that academic researchers increasingly share the view that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Criticism: 
  While the passage suggests that there is a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement, this is not an absolute guarantee that the researcher will not be held liable for patent infringement if they conduct the research and are subsequently sued.
  Additionally, the passage suggests that the perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through the operation of a contractual agreement, so it is possible that the corporation holding the patent would not allow the researcher to use the cell lines without a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement.

  There has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
Thought:
  The researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. 
  The author indicates that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate, which suggests that it is likely that the biotechnology corporation would allow the researcher to use the cell lines under some circumstances, such as if the research is noncommercial and is unlikely to present a threat to the corporation's market position.
  The author also notes that there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement, which suggests that the researcher may not be held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  However, it is unclear whether the biotechnology corporation would demand a prohibitively high payment for the use of the cell lines, or if the university would prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  Therefore, it is most likely that the researcher has a chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued, but it is unclear whether the researcher will be able to use the cell lines or if the university will permit the research.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the tension between biotechnology patenting and basic, noncommercial research.
  The passage argues that granting a patent does not imply granting the right to deny access.
  Patent litigation is expensive, and there is a tradition of noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
Thought: 
  The passage argues that patents provide scientists with incentive to innovate, so it is unlikely that the corporation holding the patent would want to prevent the researcher from using their cell lines.
  Although the corporation may want to receive compensation or benefit for the costs invested in creating the materials, it is unlikely that they would demand prohibitively high payment or sue the researcher for patent infringement.
  Therefore, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research.
  The answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Criticism: 
  None.

  The answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Criticism: 
  None of the choices mentions the possibility of the corporation offering to grant permission for the use of the patented cell lines in exchange for a licensing agreement or permission to use any resulting marketable product, which is a possibility according to the passage.
  Also, it is possible that the university researcher's institution may have already obtained a license agreement for the use of the patented cell lines.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions are increasingly in favor of intellectual property protection, including patents for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. 
  The patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now receiving increased attention from scientists and policy makers. 
  Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. 
  However, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher conducting basic and noncommercial research is questionable. 
Thought: 
  The author believes that academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents are confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials, and that patents will likely spur rather than hinder basic research because they provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. 
  Although it is possible that a corporation holding a patent on cell lines may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken, the author predicts that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  The author does not predict that the corporation will demand a prohibitively high payment for the use of the cell lines, that the corporation will successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement, that the university will prohibit the research, or that the corporation will offer to fund the research in exchange for exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
Action: Answer("D")

  The passage discusses the debate over whether biotechnology should be patentable, and the concerns that patenting may hinder basic research by limiting access to research materials. 
  The passage notes that scientists who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials.
  The passage argues that researchers who fear patenting biological materials are mistaken to assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access; however, it also acknowledges that some patent-holders may attempt to restrict access to materials through legal or contractual means.
  The passage notes that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model as biotechnology has become more commercialized.
Thought:
  The passage argues that the researcher's prospects of using the patented cell lines for basic, noncommercial research are good, despite concerns that patenting may limit access to research materials.
  The passage notes that concerns about biotechnology patenting are based on the possibility that patent holders may restrict access to research materials, either through enforcement of patent rights or through contractual agreements, and that some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research.
  However, the passage also notes that patent litigation is expensive and usually initiated only to protect a market position, and that there has been a tradition of respecting a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Therefore, it seems likely that a university researcher conducting basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation would not be liable for patent infringement, even if the corporation holding the patent attempted to restrict access to the cell lines.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the concerns about the impact of biotechnology patents on basic research.
  Researchers fear that patent holders may restrict access to research materials and prevent further research.
  However, the author argues that patenting actually provides scientists with incentives to innovate and that noncommercial research exceptions to patent infringement are respected by judges.
Thought: 
  The author argues that patent holders are unlikely to take legal action against noncommercial researchers, and even if they do, there is a tradition of respecting a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Therefore, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  The answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Criticism: 
  The author argues that there is a tradition of respecting a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement, but this may not always be the case.
  There have been cases where patent holders have taken legal action against noncommercial researchers, such as in the case of Myriad Genetics and the BRCA1/2 gene patents.
  Therefore, while the researcher may have a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement, it is not guaranteed.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the subtractive method, which is used to produce brain scans that depict areas of the brain that are active during cognitive tasks. 
  The passage also critiques the modular theory of mind, which posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.

  The author also critiques the subtractive method for producing a false impression of neat functional localization, as the method subtracts out all the distributed brain functions. 
  The author does not explicitly state whether the empirical results derived using the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications, but they do question the validity of the modular theory of mind. 
  The author does not make any statements about emotions being seated in the amygdala, nor do they suggest that the subtractive method supports this claim. 
  The author argues that the subtractive method does not support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion of localization. 
  The author does not suggest that the view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans, specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), in psychology as a research method.
  FMRI measures the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The method used in FMRI obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and only displays differential brain functions.
Thought: 
  The question asks for the statement most strongly supported by the passage.
  A is incorrect because the passage argues against the idea that cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B is incorrect because the passage does not discuss whether regions of the brain not being engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use near zero.
  C is correct because the passage states that the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain during the performance of certain cognitive tasks.
  D is incorrect because the passage does not specifically mention that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.
  E is incorrect because the passage does not mention anger specifically as a cognitive task used in FMRI.
Criticism: 
  The thought process is correct.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the use of brain scans to study mental activity and the modular theory of mind.
- FMRI is a type of brain scan that shows the differential rate of oxygen use in response to a cognitive task.
Thought:
- The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind may not be valid, as mental processes may not be decomposable into separate modules.
- The passage also explains that FMRI shows differential rates of oxygen use in different parts of the brain in response to a cognitive task.
- The passage does not provide support for options A, B, D, or E.
- Option C is consistent with the explanation of FMRI given in the passage.
Criticism:
- None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology and critiques the modular theory of mind.
  It explains that brain scans reveal well-defined areas that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks, but that this is due to a subtractive method that obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Thought: 
  The passage does not support statement A. While the modular theory of mind posits independent modules located in specific regions of the brain, the passage critiques this theory and suggests that mental processes may instead be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  The passage does support statement C. It explains that functional MRI scans reveal areas of the brain that are most metabolically active during certain cognitive tasks, and that this is due to a differential rate of oxygen use that is calculated using a subtractive method.
  The passage does not support statements B, D, or E. These statements either misinterpret the information in the passage or assert information that is not discussed in the passage.
Criticism: 
  The passage is complex and contains a lot of information that could be misinterpreted or misunderstood.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology to identify localized brain regions involved in specific cognitive tasks.
  The modular theory of mind holds that mental activity can be analyzed into independent modules, or components, and these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  William Uttal argues that it is likely that mental processes are not decomposable into independent modules.
  The subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) produces images of areas of the brain that are most metabolically active during a specific cognitive task by subtracting the baseline measurement of the control condition from the measurement of the on-task condition.
Thought: 
  The passage doesn't support option A. The author describes William Uttal's perspective that mental processes are not decomposable into independent modules and argues that separating emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience.
  Option B is not supported by the passage. There is no mention of the rate of oxygen use being close to zero in regions of the brain not engaged in a specific cognitive task.
  The passage supports option C. The FMRI provides a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain and that the subtractive method used in FMRI shows that areas of the brain which are most metabolically active show a higher rate of oxygen use compared to the rest of the brain.
  Option D is not supported by the passage. There is no mention of any region of the brain having high metabolic activity at all times from the baseline measurements.
  Option E is not supported by the passage. The author briefly mentions that when he gets angry, he generally does so for a reason.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and challenges the modular theory of mind, which assumes that mental activity is decomposable into independent modules located in specific regions of the brain. 
  The passage explains how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) works and describes one of its limitations.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind may not be a valid way to understand mental activity. 
  The passage also explains that FMRI measures the differential rate of oxygen use between a baseline measurement and a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task. 
  The passage notes that this subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, which raises questions about the validity of the interpretative claims made from the results. 
  From these ideas, we can infer that choice C is most strongly supported by the passage, as it describes what the FMRI measures and how it is used to interpret metabolic activity in specific cognitive tasks.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not support choices A, B, D, or E. 
  Choice A is contradicted by the critique of the modular theory of mind presented in the passage. 
  Choice B is not discussed in the passage and is not a necessary consequence of the modular theory of mind. 
  Choice D is not mentioned in the passage and the description of the subtractive method suggests that all regions of the brain are active in both conditions. 
  Choice E is not discussed in the passage and does not follow from the description of the subtractive method. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity and the modular theory of mind.
  FMRI brain scans are used to measure metabolic activity.
  The subtractive method of analyzing FMRI brain scans involves taking a baseline measurement and then a second measurement while the subject is performing a cognitive task, then subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
Thought: 
  The passage argues against the modular theory of mind and instead suggests that mental activity may not be decomposable into independent modules.
  FMRI brain scans do reveal well-defined areas that "light up" in response to cognitive tasks.
  These areas have a higher rate of oxygen use during a cognitive task than in the control condition.
  The subtractive method is used to isolate this differential rate of oxygen use associated with the cognitive task from the baseline rate of oxygen use.
  Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and neuroscience research.
  FMRI imaging measures metabolic activity in different regions of the brain.
  The modular theory of mind holds that distinct modules are instantiated in specialized regions of the brain.
  William Uttal argues that it is unlikely that mental activity is decomposable into distinct modules in the brain.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind, and the idea that the brain is composed of distinct modules that are localized in specific regions, is problematic.
  The FMRI measures the differential metabolic activity in different regions of the brain during a cognitive task.
  The entire brain is active during both control and cognitive task conditions.
  The subtractive method may obscure the fact that the entire brain is active during cognitive tasks.
  Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. 
  The answer is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Criticism: 
  There is no support in the passage for statements A, B, or D.
  While the passage mentions anger as an example of a cognitive task that involves multiple regions of the brain, it does not support statement E.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology and the modular theory of mind.
  The modular theory of mind is the premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a research method in which the differential rate of oxygen use is measured in response to various cognitive tasks.
  The subtractive method used to analyze FMRI obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both control and on-task conditions.
Thought: 
  The passage argues against the modular theory of mind, suggesting that it may be an oversimplification of the complexity of mental processes.
  It also describes the subtractive method used in analyzing FMRI, which shows the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The passage suggests that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and that the subtractive method may obscure this fact.
  Choice C accurately reflects the information presented in the passage.
Criticism: 
  There are no significant flaws in the logic and reasoning used to arrive at choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), in psychology to understand the modular theory of mind.
  The modular theory of mind is the premise that the mind can be broken down into separate and distinct modules, or components, that are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  Psychologist William Uttal challenges the modular theory of mind, arguing that mental activity is likely distributed throughout the brain rather than being decomposable into independent modules.
  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain and show areas that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks.
  The subtractive method is used to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the modular theory of mind and the use of neuroimaging, specifically FMRI scans, to understand it.
  FMRI scans show areas of the brain that are most metabolically active during performance of certain cognitive tasks.
  The baseline measurements taken for use in the subtractive method likely do not show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times, as this would go against the reasoning of the subtractive method.
  The passage does not provide evidence to strongly support any of the statements B, D, or E.
  The passage supports the idea that the modular theory of mind may not accurately reflect the way mental activity is distributed throughout the brain, which leans away from statement A.
  Therefore, statement C is the most strongly supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and the modular theory of mind.
  FMRI is a type of brain scan that measures metabolic activity in different parts of the brain.
  FMRI is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, but it actually depicts the differential rate of oxygen use.
Thought:
  FMRI brain scans reveal well-defined areas that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks.
  FMRI measures the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain.
  The subtractive method subtracts a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement to produce a map of metabolic activity associated with the cognitive task.
  Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is:
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the defendant's challenge to fingerprint evidence in his criminal conviction, asserting that fingerprint examiners lack uniformity and objective standards, while the court supports the continued use of fingerprint identification as reliable evidence.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack consistent standards for identifying a match between prints and highlights the lack of understanding of the rate of erroneous identification, citing a more rigorous test which showed a 34 percent error rate.
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification is a long-established and reliable form of evidence, despite the defendant's challenge to its uniformity and objectivity.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack consistent standards for identifying a match and that there is little understanding of the error rate.
  The authors seem to disagree on the reliability of fingerprint identification and the consistency of standards for identifying a match.
  Choice B appears to be the area of greatest disagreement between the two passages, as Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate, while Passage B argues that the error rate is unknown and may be as high as 34 percent.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that despite its lack of scientific law status, fingerprint evidence has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and has been found to have an exceedingly low error rate, that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification, and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review.
  Passage B argues that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for fingerprint identification, that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, and that a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate, and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review.
  Passage B argues that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for fingerprint identification, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, and that a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree about the error rate for fingerprint identification.
  Therefore, the answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the defendant's challenge to the reliability of fingerprint evidence, claims that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. Although fingerprint identification is not a scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and is considered reliable. Fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review.
  Passage B discusses the lack of objective standards for fingerprint examiners' evaluation of whether two prints "match." There is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. 
Thought: 
  The authors seem to have different opinions on whether fingerprint identification has uniform, objective standards and whether fingerprint examiners have an established error rate in their identification process. Passage A suggests that there are uniform standards in place for fingerprint examiners, they are regularly tested and held to proficiency requirements, and the method is reliable in criminal trials. Passage B, on the other hand, indicates that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study. It seems like the authors would agree on the need for further testing and the development of more consistent standards in fingerprint identification. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has an established track record and has withstood the test of time.
  Passage B claims that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards and there is no consensus on what constitutes a match.
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A argue in favor of the reliability of fingerprint identification and claim that it has been used for a long time with a low error rate. 
  The author of Passage B, on the other hand, highlights the lack of objective standards in fingerprint identification and emphasizes the uncertainty of determining a match.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification and the error rates.
  Therefore, the answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. 
  The authors of the two passages are in disagreement about the reliability of fingerprint identification and the error rates associated with it. 
  This disagreement is highlighted in their different perspectives on the standards and methods used by fingerprint examiners.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The defendant in a criminal conviction appeal challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him, citing the lack of testing and established error rates in fingerprint identification theory.
  In Passage A, the court upholds the use of fingerprint identification as reliable evidence despite the lack of scientific law and varied standards among different agencies and examiners.
  Passage B argues against the reliability of fingerprint identification, criticizing the lack of objective standards and consensus among examiners on what constitutes a match. It also questions the likelihood of erroneous identification and the absence of systematic study on error rates.
Thought: 
  The authors in Passage A and B have conflicting opinions on the reliability of fingerprint identification.
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate and has been used in criminal trials for 100 years with established standards through professional training and peer review.
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that fingerprint identification lacks objective standards and consensus among examiners on what constitutes a match. It also questions the likelihood of erroneous identification and the absence of systematic study on error rates.
  The authors would most likely disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification.
  Therefore, the answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. 
  However, it would have been more accurate to state that the authors disagree on the reliability of fingerprint identification, rather than focusing specifically on the likelihood of incorrect declaration of a match.
  Another possible answer could be C, as Passage A argues for the use of fingerprint identification despite the lack of scientific law, while Passage B questions its reliability and suggests that it should not be accorded scientific law status.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the challenges made by a defendant to the fingerprint evidence used against him and argues in favor of its reliability as evidence.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match and that there is no agreement on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. It also raises questions about the error rate of fingerprint identification in practice.
Thought:
  Passage A argues in favor of the reliability of fingerprint evidence and asserts that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match and raises questions about the error rate of fingerprint identification in practice.
  The authors of the two passages would most likely disagree about the reliability of fingerprint evidence and the extent to which uniform standards have been established for fingerprint identification.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree about whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that while fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. It acknowledges that there may be inconsistent requirements among different agencies but holds that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. The author also notes that fingerprint examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review.
  
  Passage B argues that there is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification among fingerprint examiners, and that some examiners use a "point-counting" method while others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. The author notes that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. The author also cites criticism for some proficiency tests that show examiners making few or no errors, but acknowledges a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Thought:
  The authors are likely to disagree the most about the reliability of fingerprint identification, specifically whether it is objective and uniformly applied. Passage A argues that the "points and characteristics" approach is rigorous and consistent, with standards established through professional training and peer review. The author is confident that applying these methods, fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B argues that there is no objective standard for declaring a match, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study. The author notes that there is no agreement among fingerprint examiners on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and that even partial and smudged prints are used in forensic identification. Therefore, it is possible that the authors disagree about the error rate, reliability, and uniformity of fingerprint identification.
  
   Answer: B
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A defends the use of fingerprint identification in criminal trials and suggests that it has an exceedingly low error rate.
  Passage B critiques the lack of objective standards for fingerprint matching, and suggests that the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study.
Thought:
  Passage A defends the use of fingerprint identification and suggests it has an exceedingly low error rate. 
  Passage B highlights the lack of objective standards for fingerprint matching and suggests that the error rate has not been systematically studied.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree about the error rate of fingerprint identification in criminal cases.
  Specifically, Passage A suggests that the error rate is low, while Passage B suggests that the error rate is not well-established and may be higher than commonly assumed.
  The answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct. The authors do not seem to disagree on whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable, whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law, the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification, or whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  C: A work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  D: The best works of art improve with age.
  E: Some forms of art are superior to others.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that great perfume should be taken more seriously as an art form.
  The author draws parallels between the art of painting and the art of perfume-making.
Thought:
  The author argues that perfume-making is an art form that is comparable to painting.
  Perfumers experiment with olfactory elements to produce combinations of scents that create an imaginary world, much like a painter creates an illusion of life on canvas.
  These combinations of scents change and develop over time, creating many small sensations that can evoke memories or experiences.
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for statement A: "A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes."
Criticism:
  The passage is specifically about the art of perfume-making and its comparison to painting, and does not necessarily provide support for the idea that all works of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through memories.
  Furthermore, while the passage does mention that scents can evoke memories, it does not necessarily imply that this is the primary or only way in which a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the parallels between the art of painting and the art of creating perfume.
  Painters use pigments and media to create works of art, while perfumers create complex configurations of olfactory elements.
  Both art forms can create an aesthetic experience.
  Perfumes made by large corporations may contain cheap chemical compounds in an effort to increase profits.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the ways in which perfumers and painters use materials to create art.
  The author notes that perfumers can create an imaginary world with their scents, just as painters create an illusion of life on canvas.
  The author also notes that corporations may compromise the quality of perfumes in order to increase profits.
  While the passage provides support for the ideas that art can create an aesthetic experience and that corporate involvement can negatively affect art, it does not provide support for the ideas that a work of art will fail if created for commercial success, that the best works of art improve with age, or that some forms of art are superior to others.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the similarities between the art of painting and the art of creating perfumes.
  It highlights the use of natural and synthetic chemicals in creating perfumes, much like how painters use natural and synthetic pigments with oils and resins.
  The passage also mentions the ability of perfumes to evoke memories and emotions, similar to how paintings can bring about an aesthetic experience.
Thought: 
  The passage argues that perfumes and paintings are similar in many ways.
  The process of creating perfumes involves combining various olfactory elements in a way that produces small sensations which change and develop over time.
  Similarly, painters use pigments and media to create images that may convey a range of emotions and sensations to the viewer.
  The passage does not suggest that any form of art is superior or inferior to others.
  Additionally, while the passage does suggest that commercial interests can negatively impact the quality of perfumes, it does not suggest that a work of art will inevitably fail if created for commercial success.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the parallels between oil paintings and perfumes, highlighting the skills and creativity required by both perfumers and painters.
  The author argues that perfumes are undervalued compared to other forms of art.
  The passage also criticizes the modern perfume industry for using cheap ingredients to increase profits.
Thought:

  The author argues that perfumes are undervalued compared to other forms of art.
  The passage does not make a direct argument about whether a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through evoking memories.
  The passage does suggest that both perfumes and paintings can evoke memories and emotions.
  However, this argument is not enough to support choice A.
  The passage does suggest that perfumes are made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations, who often tamper with old formulas to increase profits.
  This criticism of the modern perfume industry suggests that a work of art created solely for commercial success is likely to fail.
  This argument supports choice C.
Criticism:
  While the passage suggests that both perfumes and paintings can evoke memories and emotions, it does not provide enough support to fully justify choice A.
  The passage does not make a direct argument about whether a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for commercial success.
  However, the passage does criticize the modern perfume industry for using cheap ingredients to increase profits, suggesting that this practice can negatively impact the quality of the perfume.
  This criticism supports choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the parallels between the art of painting and the art of creating perfumes.
  The passage describes how talented perfumers experiment with olfactory elements to produce complex configurations that evoke memories and sensations in the same way that great paintings and music can.
Thought:
  The passage discusses how perfumers use their skills to create an imaginary world of scents that can evoke memories and emotions, just as great works of art can.
  The passage does not suggest that any one form of art is superior to others or that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for commercial success.
  The passage does suggest that the quality of fine perfume has suffered as large corporations have substituted cheaper ingredients in order to increase profits.
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for the statement that A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between art and perfume-making.
Thought: 
  The passage argues that perfume-making is a form of art, comparable in complexity and power to painting and music. It describes the intricate process of blending olfactory elements to create an imaginary world that can evoke memories and emotions. It suggests that the reason why perfumes are undervalued as works of art is that they are manipulated by large corporations for profit. There is no indication in the passage that one form of art is superior to others, or that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for commercial success. However, the passage does provide support for the idea that a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes, as suggested by the comparison with perfumes. Therefore, the best answer is A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfumery as art forms.
  It highlights the skill and creativity required to formulate complex combinations of materials in both art forms.
  It notes that some works of art, including perfumes, may be undervalued due to commercial interests.
Thought: 
  The passage does not suggest that one form of art is superior to another, so option E is incorrect. 
  The passage discusses the power of art to evoke memories, but it does not say that this is the only way that it can bring about an aesthetic experience, so option A is not the best answer. 
  The passage highlights the harmonious combination of many small sensations in perfume, so option B seems to be a good answer. 
  The passage notes that works of art created for the sake of commercial success may be undervalued, but it does not say that they will inevitably fail, so option C is not the best answer. 
  The passage notes that the appearance of oil paintings changes over time, but it does not specifically say that they improve with age, so option D is not the best answer. 
Criticism: 
  Option A is a possible interpretation of the passage, but it may not be the most accurate. 
  Option B is supported by the passage, but it does not capture all of the ideas expressed. 
  Option C and D are not well-supported by the passage. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the similarities between the art of painting and the art of creating perfumes, and argues that perfumes are undervalued and ill-served by corporations that prioritize profits over quality.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that perfumes are an art form, and that they can provide an aesthetic experience similar to that of painting or music. The author compares the way in which painters use pigments and oils to create a visual experience with the way in which perfumers use natural and synthetic compounds to create a olfactory experience. The author argues that perfumers are in the same business as painters, and that they can evoke memories and emotions in the same way. 
  The passage does not support the idea that one art form is superior to another, nor does it suggest that works of art must be created solely for artistic purposes. While the passage is critical of corporations that prioritize profits over quality, it does not argue that commercial success is inherently at odds with artistic success.
  The closest answer choice is A, which suggests that memories can be evoked by a work of art. While this is supported by the passage, it does not capture the full extent of the argument, which is that perfumes can provide a powerful aesthetic experience that is similar to that of other art forms.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the similarities between painting and perfume in terms of their use of natural and synthetic chemical compounds to create a work of art that stimulates the senses.

  The passage does suggest that a work of art can evoke memories and create an aesthetic experience. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the similarities between the creation of oil paintings and the creation of perfumes.
  It argues that perfumes are undervalued and that many are made with cheap chemical compounds that approximate rarer ingredients.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that perfumes are just as capable of evoking memories and creating an aesthetic experience as oil paintings.
  Similarly to how painters carefully formulate their pigments and media to create a work of art, perfumers carefully formulate olfactory elements to create a scent.
  The passage does not provide support for the idea that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  The passage does not suggest that the best works of art improve with age.
  The passage does not compare the superiority of one form of art to another.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings

  The passage discusses the potential effectiveness of stealing thunder as a courtroom strategy.
  Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and persuasive.
  Stealing thunder may provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment and may make evidence seem less valuable if it is already known to both sides.
Thought:
  The question is asking which factor probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
  The passage discusses a few factors, but one specific factor is mentioned as probably contributing to the success of this strategy.
  None of the options mention the psychological explanation for credibility or the potential effect on perceptions of evidence value.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.

Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The passage is about prions, a unique class of protein pathogens that are capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. Researchers discovered this class of pathogen while researching the cause of CJD, a type of degenerative dementia in humans. The pathogens reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation. As the pathogen spreads, it produces a plaque consisting of thread-like structures that collect in the brain and ultimately destroy nerve cells. Although the discovery of prions was initially met with skepticism, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that they are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. Hence, the correct answer is B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a new class of protein pathogen that has been discovered in connection with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use
  D: detectable using brain scans enhanced by means of the subtractive method
  E: features of a general mental activity that is spread throughout the brain
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the validity of the modular theory of mind and the use of brain scans to study mental activity.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A suggests that neuroscience changes the way we think about the law, casting doubt on the idea of moral responsibility.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and how it might coexist with determinism.
Thought: 
  Passage A connects recent findings in neuroscience with the idea that we might not be as free as we think we are in making moral choices. It argues that this discovery should lead to a change in the way we administer punishment.
  Passage B distinguishes between constrained actions and free actions. It suggests that actions originating from a healthy brain are not constrained and are therefore free, even if they are causally determined.
  The concept of mental disorder is mentioned in both passages and is not the answer.
  The concept of causality is mentioned in both passages and is not the answer.
  Self-delusion is mentioned in Passage A but not in Passage B. 
  Free choice is mentioned in Passage B but not in Passage A. 
  Moral responsibility is mentioned in Passage A but not in Passage B.
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that behavior is caused by brain operations and suggests that sentencing should focus on deterrence rather than retribution.
  Passage B discusses the compatibility of free will and determinism and distinguishes between free and constrained actions based on whether they are caused by internal or external sources.
Thought: 
  Passage A doesn't involve the concept of free choice or the compatibility of determinism and free will.
  Passage B distinguishes between free and constrained actions based on internal and external sources and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Therefore, the concept of free choice is discussed in Passage B but not in Passage A.
  The answer is B: free choice.
Criticism: 
  There are some minor connections between the two passages in terms of free choice and determinism.
  However, Passage A doesn't explicitly discuss the concept of free choice, and the focus on deterrence and abandonment of retribution is somewhat relevant to the argument in the second passage.
  So, it is possible that there may be another viable answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that humans think they are making free and rational moral choices, but a brain scan might show that they are deluding themselves and that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving.
  Passage A suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution, which is now dominant as a justification of punishment, and instead focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B argues that a person can still act freely even in a deterministic world.
  Ayer, the philosopher who put forth a theory of "soft determinism," argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained and that it is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues against the idea of free choice and moral responsibility, suggesting that such choices do not exist and that people may be deluding themselves.
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that a person can still act freely even in a deterministic world through the concept of soft determinism and the distinction between free and constrained actions.
  Therefore, the concept of free choice plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A.
  The answer is B: free choice.
Criticism: N/A
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that behavior is caused solely by the operations of the brain, which can run contrary to a person's belief that they are making a free and rational moral choice.
  This suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing bad people for their immoral acts.
  Passage B discusses how determinism can coexist with the concept of free will, with free actions being those not constrained by external sources.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that behavior is caused solely by the operations of the brain, which can run contrary to a person's belief that they are making a free and rational moral choice.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free choice as distinct from constrained actions, which are caused by external sources, such as mental disorders.
  Therefore, the concept of mental disorder plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A.
  The answer is A: mental disorder.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that humans do not have free will; their actions are caused by the operations of the brain and not by a free choice.
  It suggests that this insight implies that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing bad people for their immoral acts.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.

  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism and how it is possible for a person to act freely even in a deterministic world.
Thought:
  Passage A does not talk about the concept of free will or determinism.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism and the idea that actions can be considered free as long as they are not constrained.
  Mental disorder is mentioned in both passages, but it is not the concept that is being contrasted between the two arguments.
  Causality is mentioned in both passages and is a key concept in both arguments.
  Self-delusion is mentioned only in passage A and is used to suggest that people may not be making free and rational moral choices.
  Moral responsibility is mentioned only in passage A and is used to suggest that the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution as a justification for punishment.
  Therefore, the concept that plays a role in the argument of Passage B but not in that of Passage A is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")

Thought: 
  Passage A argues against retribution and suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism, and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, with the source of the cause determining whether an action is free.
  Both passages discuss different aspects of causality and free choice.
  Passage A discusses the possibility that free and rational moral choice may actually be delusional and correlate with activity in emotional centers in the brain, while passage B discusses the concept of soft determinism and argues that actions are free if they are not constrained by external sources.
  Mental disorder, self-delusion, and moral responsibility are not the primary concepts discussed in either passage.
  Therefore, the concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: According to the passage, which one of the following was true of the physics community during the 1930s?
Choices:
  A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: It reevaluated caleulations indicating that atoms could be split
  C: It never identified the by-products ofneutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  D: It showed that uraniwn atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: It recogoized the daogers of working with radioactive substances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses developments in the understanding of nuclear fission in the 1930s.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the physics community during the 1930s did not initially recognize the significance of the evidence they were amassing related to nuclear fission.
  Theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart before the experiments with neutron bombardment of uranium began.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not initially aimed at achieving nuclear fission.
  Researchers were not receptive to the possibility of achieving nuclear fission through neutron bombardment.
  Researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without initially recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Minute quantities of the radioactive substances produced in experiments with neutron bombardment of uranium hampered precise chemical analyses.
  Barium was identified as a substance resulting from neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.
  Meitner coined the term "nuclear fission."
  The right conceptual link was lacking to recognize the significance of the evidence that had been present for some time.
Conclusion:
  The answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments. 
  The passage suggests that some theoretical physicists produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart before the experiments with neutron bombardment of uranium began. However, researchers did not recognize what they were witnessing during the experiments, and they did not identify the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium. Therefore, the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the scientific community's understanding during the 1930s.
  A: The passage does not make any explicit statements about the community neglecting earlier theoretical developments.
  B: The passage does not make any explicit statements about the community reevaluating calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
  C: The passage discusses how the community identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium, but had difficulty identifying them precisely due to the dangers of working with radioactive substances and the expectation that they would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  D: The passage discusses how the discovery of nuclear fission resulted from researchers' attempts to understand the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium, which were not aimed at achieving a result of splitting atoms apart.
  E: The passage makes brief mention of the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
Thought: 
  The passage describes the discovery of nuclear fission and the scientific community's understanding during the 1930s.
  The community identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium but had difficulty identifying them precisely due to the dangers of working with radioactive substances and the expectation that they would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Researchers' attempts to understand the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium were not aimed at achieving a result of splitting atoms apart.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that the community showed that uranium atoms were the easiest to split.
  There is no evidence in the passage for statement A or B, so neither of those is a likely answer.
  Although the passage makes brief mention of the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, it does not suggest that researchers recognized these dangers to the extent that statement E implies.
  Therefore, statement C is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the history of research on the topic from 1934 to 1939.
  A: The passage does not provide information about whether the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: The passage does not mention any reevaluation of calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
  C: The passage describes how the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium were seen by scientists, but they were not identified until later.
  D: The passage does not suggest that uranium atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: The passage briefly mentions the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the history of research on the topic from 1934 to 1939.
  The text describes how the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium were seen by scientists, but were not identified until later.
  Therefore, the physics community did not immediately identify the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The answer is C: It never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism: 
  The answer choice "C" is not entirely true. 
  The passage states that the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium were identified later, not that they were never identified.
  The answer choice "A" cannot be eliminated as the passage does not provide information about the physics community's attention to earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:

  C: The passage explains that scientists had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but they did not recognize what they were witnessing. They also identified a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, but these products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  D: The passage does not state that uranium atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: The passage notes that working with highly radioactive materials was dangerous.
Thought:

They also identified a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, but these products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  So, the correct answer is not C.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Italian physicists first bombarded uranium with neutrons in 1934.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
  Scientists compiled evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without realizing it.
Thought: 
  The physics community during the 1930s was not aware of the significance of nuclear fission.
  The passage mentions that scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Therefore, Option A is incorrect.
  The passage does not mention a reevaluation of calculations indicating that atoms could be split. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.
  Scientists in the 1930s did not identify the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium. However, they did produce numerous similar results, and the products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.
  The passage does not mention whether uranium atoms were the easiest to split. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.
  The passage mentions that precise chemical analyses were hampered by the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials. Therefore, Option E may be correct.
  However, Option E is not the best answer to the question and does not reflect the main idea of the passage.
  The passage describes how scientists compiled evidence of nuclear fission without realizing it until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  Therefore, the best answer is "none of the above" as none of the options accurately describe the physics community during the 1930s as it relates to the discovery of nuclear fission.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of a means of splitting the nuclei of atoms by neutron bombardment of uranium, which was achieved between 1934 and 1939.

  Scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection to the discovery of nuclear fission.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the physics community during the 1930s:
  - Had neglected earlier theoretical developments, but it doesn't specify that.
  - Reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split, but the text says that a common view was that it would be impossible for a neutron to break apart a uranium nucleus.
  - Never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium. This is partially correct, as the researchers couldn't identify the substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium since they expected them to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  - Showed that uranium atoms were the easiest to split, but the passage doesn't provide evidence to support this.
  - Recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances. The text suggests that precise chemical analyses were hampered by the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  Therefore, the most accurate answer is E: It recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances.
Criticism:
  The passage does not provide sufficient information to know for sure if the physics community recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances during the 1930s. However, the passage does suggest that precise chemical analyses were hampered by the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
Action: Answer("E")

  The passage describes that scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  They did not even believe that it would be possible for a neutron to break apart a uranium nucleus, so they were not initially receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission.
  Therefore, it is likely that the physics community did not identify the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The passage does not support A, B, D, or E.
  The answer is C: It never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism: 
  The passage does describe that scientists observed radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, but the products remained unidentified because they were expected to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  However, the passage also describes Lise Meitner's discovery of a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Later, one of the substances (barium) was conclusively identified as a byproduct of uranium fission.
  Therefore, while the physics community may not have initially identified all the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium, they did ultimately identify at least one of them as a byproduct of uranium fission.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the circumstances surrounding the scientific community's understanding of it.
  A: The passage does not mention neglect of earlier theoretical developments.
  B: The passage does not mention reevaluation of calculations.
  C: The passage discusses the identification of the by-products of neutron bombardment, but notes that they remained unidentified for a time due to expectations about their nuclear composition.
  D: The passage does not make a comparison between the ease of splitting uranium atoms versus other atomic nuclei.
  E: The passage notes that precise analysis of the by-products was hampered by the dangers of working with radioactive materials.
Thought: 
  The passage details how the discovery of nuclear fission was a gradual process, with many scientists compiling evidence of the phenomenon over several years without recognizing what they were witnessing. 
  The passage notes that precise chemical analyses of by-products of neutron bombardment were hampered by minute quantities and the dangers of radioactive materials. 
  Therefore, it is possible that scientists were aware of the by-products, but had difficulty identifying them due to the practical limitations outlined in the passage.
  The passage does not mention any comparisons between uranium and other atomic nuclei.
  The passage mentions that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart, but this was before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  The passage notes that the researchers were not receptive to the possibility of atomic nuclei being broken apart during neutron-bombardment experiments.
  The passage does not provide information about whether the scientific community recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of nuclear fission and the history of its recognition.
  The discovery was aided by several researchers, including Enrico Fermi, Lise Meitner, and Otto Hahn.
  Meitner was the first to recognize the significance of the data in relation to the underlying theoretical considerations.
  The initial experiments were focused on neutron bombardment of uranium.
  By-products of the experiments' were identified as elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
Thought:
  The physics community during the 1930s did not recognize the significance of the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.
  They were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms in that context.
  Earlier, theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that atoms could be split; however, this idea was not recognized by the physics community.
  The experiments were focused on neutron bombardment of uranium to produce radioactive substances.
  By-products of the experiments were identified as elements close to uranium in nuclear composition, but not identified as split atoms.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A or D, but neither is entirely supported by the passage.
  Answering E is irrelevant to the question, and answering B and C contradicts the passage.
Criticism:
  A is partially supported by the passage but is not the best answer since it is not mentioned that the community neglected theoretical developments.
  D is not entirely supported by the passage since it does not claim that splitting uranium atoms was easier than other atoms.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Which one of the following is most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" (line 62)?
Choices:
  A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939
  B: the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938
  C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium
  D: the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus
  E: the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses how scientists discovered nuclear fission.
  The researchers had evidence that nuclear fission had occurred, but did not recognize it for a long time.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data and coined the term "nuclear fission."
Thought: 
  The "relevant evidence" referred to in the article must be the data that showed nuclear fission had occurred.
  The article discusses how the researchers had evidence of nuclear fission but did not recognize it for some time.
  Therefore, the "relevant evidence" must be the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
  Choice A best matches this. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how scientists discovered nuclear fission.
  Before Lise Meitner's theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
Thought:
  "The relevant evidence" (line 62) refers to the evidence that scientists had actually been splitting uranium atoms, which Meitner recognized the significance of.
  The correct choice is the one that refers to this evidence.
  A refers to experiments between 1934 and 1939, but does not specifically mention the relevant evidence.
  B refers to one of Meitner's experiments in 1938, which was related to the relevant evidence but not the evidence itself.
  C refers to clear chemical evidence that Hahn found, which was part of the relevant evidence.
  D refers to the fact that the sum of the number of particles in barium and technetium was the same as the number of particles in a uranium nucleus, which was part of the evidence that Meitner recognized the significance of.
  E does not refer to the relevant evidence.
  The best answer seems to be C and D, which both refer to parts of the relevant evidence. 
Criticism:
  The relevant evidence is primarily the evidence that scientists had actually been splitting uranium atoms, so D is the most directly relevant choice.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the years of research that led up to its discovery. 
  "The relevant evidence" is referred to in line 62.
Thought:
  The relevant evidence is what led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The author discusses a number of pieces of evidence that were obtained, such as the production of barium, technetium, and other radioactive substances.
  The author also notes that the evidence was present for some time, but lacked the right conceptual link.
  Based on this, it seems that "the relevant evidence" refers to all of the evidence that was obtained, not just one particular piece of evidence.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices seem to be an exact match, but if we have to choose the most similar one, it would be A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism:
  The author mentions that the evidence was present for some time, but lacking the right conceptual link.
  This suggests that "the relevant evidence" is not just the results of the experiments, but also the key insight that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices seem to be an exact match.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
- The author talks about the discovery of nuclear fission.
- Experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were conducted between 1934 and 1939, and increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved were compiled.
- In 1938, Lise Meitner discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, and her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation.
- Late in 1938, Hahn revealed to Meitner a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium.
- It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data and submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with physicist Otto Frisch.
Thought: 
- The author talks about "the relevant evidence" in line 62, which had been present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
- The evidence refers to the discovery of splitting uranium atoms through neutron bombardment.
- The evidence was present during the time when experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were conducted.
- The evidence was recognized by Lise Meitner in 1938 when Hahn revealed to her the surprising result of barium being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
- Meitner's recognition of the significance of the data led to the coining of the term "nuclear fission".
- Therefore, the most nearly equivalent to "the relevant evidence" in line 62 is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism: 
- The evidence referred to in line 62 is the evidence of splitting uranium atoms through neutron bombardment, which was not limited to Meitner's experiments in 1938 alone.
- While Hahn's discovery of barium was a significant component of the evidence, it was not the only evidence.
- However, the experimental evidence accumulated by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 was the main evidence referred to.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the evidence that led up to it. 
In 1934, a group of Italian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons. 
Between 1934 and 1939, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing. 
In 1938, Lise Meitner discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. 
In late 1938, Otto Hahn wrote to Meitner of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium. 
Hahn noted that the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.
Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had been splitting uranium atoms. 
Thought: 
"The relevant evidence" mentioned in line 62 most likely refers to the evidence that led to the conclusion that uranium atoms were being split.
This evidence includes the fact that barium was produced by neutron bombardment of uranium and the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus. 
Option A refers to experiments conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 which compiled evidence, but the question is asking for "the relevant evidence" specifically. 
Option B refers to Meitner's own research which was related but not necessarily the same as the evidence that led to the conclusion of uranium atom splitting. 
Option C refers to the clear chemical evidence found by Hahn that barium was produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. This is a crucial piece of evidence that contributes to the conclusion, but there were other considerations as well. 
Option D refers to the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of such particles in a uranium nucleus. This fact is important in understanding how uranium atoms were being split, but it does not fully encompass the relevant evidence. 
Option E refers to the fact that the radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for some time. While this may have contributed to the delay in understanding, it is not the same as "the relevant evidence" that led to the conclusion of uranium atom splitting. 
Therefore, the best answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes the discovery of nuclear fission, which was achieved through neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The researchers compiled evidence of nuclear fission without fully recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection about nuclear fission in 1939.
Thought: 
  The "relevant evidence" (line 62) refers to the evidence that enabled the researchers to finally recognize that they were splitting uranium atoms through nuclear fission.
  The discovery of barium's clear chemical evidence provided by Otto Hahn was a pivotal finding in the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Therefore, the answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the history of the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Meitner discovered that uranium atoms were being split by neutron bombardment.
  Hahn identified barium as one of the products of the neutron bombardment of uranium, which was unexpected.
Thought: 
  The "relevant evidence" referred to in line 62 is likely the evidence that uranium atoms were being split by neutron bombardment.
  This is supported by the context of the passage, which discusses how scientists compiled evidence of nuclear fission without recognizing it until Meitner made the conceptual link.
  Choice A is too broad, as it refers to all experiments conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
  Choice B refers only to Meitner's experiments in 1938, which were related to but not the same as the neutron bombardment experiments.
  Choice C refers to the clear chemical evidence of barium production, which was unexpected but not necessarily the "relevant evidence" that the author is referring to.
  Choice D refers to the fact that the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus, which was important for understanding the process of nuclear fission but not necessarily the "relevant evidence" that the author is referring to.
  Choice E refers to the fact that the products of neutron bombardment went unidentified for a long time, which is tangential to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The author notes that scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939, but did not recognize what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939, recognizing that researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms through neutron bombardment.
Thought: 
  The author discusses the "relevant evidence" that was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The evidence must relate to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The author notes that scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939, but did not recognize what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939, recognizing that researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms through neutron bombardment.
  Therefore, the "relevant evidence" must be the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
  The answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses a historical discovery of nuclear fission.
  The discovery was made between 1934 and 1939 by a group of scientists performing experiments.
  The discovery was recognized by Austrian physicist Lise Meitner in 1939.
Thought:
  The author mentions that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking only the right conceptual link.
  According to the passage, Meitner's crucial contribution was recognizing the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  This suggests that the "relevant evidence" the author refers to is the data from the experiments.
  Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism:
  The phrase "relevant evidence" is not explicitly defined in the passage, and different readers may interpret it differently.
  It is possible to argue that any of the other options (B, C, D, or E) could also be considered "relevant evidence" for different reasons.
  However, given the context of the discussion of the discovery process and Meitner's role in recognizing the significance of the data, A seems to be the most directly relevant option.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of nuclear fission and the difficulties encountered by scientists in recognizing what they had discovered.
Thought: 
  According to the passage, the "relevant evidence" (line 62) that had been present for some time refers to the evidence that scientists had actually been splitting uranium atoms, which was discovered by Hahn and Meitner in 1938. 
  Option A is incorrect because it refers to all the results of the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, not just the evidence that they had achieved nuclear fission.
  Option B is incorrect because it only refers to the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938, not the evidence of nuclear fission.
  Option C is incorrect because it refers only to the clear chemical evidence found by Hahn, not the evidence of nuclear fission that the passage is discussing.
  Option D is incorrect because it refers only to the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus, which is a piece of evidence that led Meitner to conclude that the uranium nucleus had been split, but it is not the evidence referred to as "relevant evidence" in the passage.
  Option E is incorrect because it refers to the difficulty in identifying the radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium, which is not the evidence referred to as "relevant evidence" in the passage.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  C: Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
  E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.

Thought: 
  The author characterizes Roy Lichtenstein as a painter who helped define pop art. Lichtenstein's work reflected contemporary life, displayed an impulse toward realism, and exuded a kind of deliberate naivete. If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters, it may suggest he was more influenced by their work than the author suggests, challenging the author's characterization. If Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting, it may suggest that he was not rebelling against abstractionism, but rather seeking to reintroduce emotion into his own work, also challenging the author's characterization. If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, it might suggest that he was not interested in reintroducing emotion into art. By contrast, if Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion, it would support the author's characterization. 
Criticism:

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the emergence of pop art and Roy Lichtenstein's place in it.
  Lichtenstein's work blended the style of comic books with the forms and intentions of fine art.
  The author describes Lichtenstein's work as conveying both parody and realism.
  Lichtenstein was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Lichtenstein's work exuded a kind of deliberate naivete and a faith in reconciliation.
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as an artist who rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism by blending the style of comic books with the forms and intentions of fine art, which conveyed both parody and realism. The author also characterizes Lichtenstein as an artist who exuded a deliberate naivete and a faith in reconciliation. Any option that challenges this characterization would have to show that Lichtenstein did not rebel against abstract expressionism, or that he did not convey both parody and realism, or that he did not exude a deliberate naivete, or that he did not have faith in reconciliation.
Evaluation: 
  A: If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of him. Many artists attend exhibitions by other artists without necessarily agreeing with or being influenced by them. This does not contradict the idea that Lichtenstein was rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  B: If Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of him. This would simply indicate that Lichtenstein appreciated emotional paintings, which is not in conflict with the idea that he was rebelling against the excess of sophistication in abstract expressionism.
  C: If Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of him. This would simply indicate that Lichtenstein appreciated emotional paintings, which is not in conflict with the idea that he was rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  D: If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, it would not challenge the author's characterization of him, since the author does not suggest that Lichtenstein opposed emotional paintings per se, but rather an excess of sophistication in some pop artists.
  E: If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion, it would not challenge the author's characterization of him, since the author suggests that Lichtenstein exuded a kind of deliberate naivete and a faith in reconciliation, and that his work conveyed both parody and realism.

  The author argues that Lichtenstein's work was not an aloof attempt to ignore abstract expressionism but rather part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  To challenge this characterization, we need to find an option that contradicts or undermines one of these points.
  Option A mentions that Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, but this would not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  Option B mentions that Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting, but this would not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work either.
  Option C mentions that Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, which again would not necessarily contradict the author's characterization.
  Option D mentions that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, which might even support the author's argument against the excess of sophistication observed in some other pop artists.

  The author argues that Lichtenstein's persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
  So, any option that suggests the opposite of these claims would challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Option A suggests that Lichtenstein had a close relationship with abstract expressionists, but this does not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Option B also suggests that Lichtenstein recognized the emotional potential of abstract expressionism, but this does not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein either.
  Option C suggests that Lichtenstein admired the emotional power of early abstract expressionists, but this does not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein either. 
  Option D suggests that Lichtenstein criticized other pop artists for producing emotional paintings, which is consistent with the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's deliberate naivete.
  Option E suggests that Lichtenstein criticized other pop artists for producing paintings void of emotion, which is also consistent with the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's deliberate naivete. 
  So, neither option A, B, or C would challenge the author's characterization.
  The most likely answer is between D and E, but since D and E are almost identical, we can choose either one.
Action: Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses how Roy Lichtenstein's work contributed to and challenged the pop art movement.
- Lichtenstein used comic book style and imagery in his fine art paintings as a commentary on contemporary culture.
- The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and as possessing an impulse towards realism and the depiction of contemporary life.
Thought:
- The question asks which statement, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
- Option A suggests that Lichtenstein continued to be interested in abstract expressionist painters even while creating his own work in a different style.
- Option B suggests that Lichtenstein did, in fact, appreciate emotionally charged works by abstract expressionist painters.
- Option C references early abstract expressionism, which the author suggests had already lost much of its force by the time pop art emerged.
- Option D suggests that Lichtenstein himself criticized another pop artist for producing emotionally charged work, which is not necessarily contradictory to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's own work.
- Option E suggests that Lichtenstein criticized another pop artist for producing work without emotion, which is not necessarily contradictory to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's own work either.
- Option B is potentially the most challenging because the author characterizes pop art as being in part a response to the emotional excesses of abstract expressionism, and if Lichtenstein praised an abstract expressionist's work for being atypically emotional, it would suggest a closer relationship between the two movements than the author implies.
Criticism:
- Option A does not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work, because attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters does not necessarily mean Lichtenstein agreed with or was influenced by their work.
- Option C is not as challenging as Option B because the author only characterizes early abstract expressionism as having lost force by the time pop art emerged, not as lacking emotional depth altogether.
- Option D and E do not provide direct evidence for or against the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Roy Lichtenstein's role in defining pop art by incorporating commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings.
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art to create a complex result that pokes fun at the pretensions of the art world while conveying a seriousness of theme.
  The author argues that pop art emerged as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, particularly with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical.
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as more than a reflection or parody of comic books. 
  Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism and a deliberate naivete that distinguishes it from other pop artists who exhibited jaded cynicism about consumer culture.
  If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, this would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of his work as pop art that responded to the fading of abstract expressionism's emotional power.
  If Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist or an early one for producing emotional paintings, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of his work as a deliberate naivete that responded to the excess of sophistication he observed in some other pop artists.
  If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings or paintings void of emotion, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of his work as pop art that conveyed a seriousness of theme while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world.
  Therefore, none of the options presented would significantly challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.

  Option A is not relevant to the characterization of Lichtenstein's work. 
  Option B is not relevant to the characterization of Lichtenstein's work. 
  Option C is not relevant to the characterization of Lichtenstein's work. 
  Option D is not relevant because the author does not discuss emotional paintings. 
  Option E is not relevant because Lichtenstein's work is said to display an impulse toward realism, not a lack of emotion. 
  None of the options challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum
  C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when accurate information is spread widely as quickly as possible.
  It suggests that people with accurate information about changing circumstances should be permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them.
  Passage A argues that "insider non-trading" is a far more widespread practice than insider-trading.
  Passage B argues that in a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time.
  It suggests that insider-trading unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence.
Thought:
  Passage A argues that accurate information should be spread widely as quickly as possible, but doesn't support the prohibition of any kind of trading.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence.
  The law that would most closely conform to the position articulated by the author of passage A, but not that articulated by the author of passage B, would be one that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock, but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  This is because passage A argues that people with accurate information about changing circumstances should be permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them, while passage B argues that insider-trading unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence.
  A law that permits trading based on analysis of a stock would reflect the position of passage A, while a law that legalizes trading based on inside information gained from one's position within a company would reflect the position of neither passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that insider trading unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence.
  A: This law would prohibit some forms of insider trading, but not all forms of trading based on non-public information.
  B: This law would permit some forms of insider trading, but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  C: This law would prohibit trading that undermines investor confidence in the stock market, but it doesn't specifically address insider-trading.
  D: This law would legalize selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibit buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is a limited version of insider-trading.
  E: This law would legalize trading based on some types of inside information, which is closer to the position articulated by passage A.

Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading helps ensure a more accurate assessment of a company's value.
  It suggests that insider trading is a necessary aspect of a functioning market and that trading based on non-public information is not always wrong.
  Therefore, a law that legalizes some types of insider trading while prohibiting others is more closely aligned with the position in Passage A.
  Option E is the only choice that legalizes some types of insider trading.

Criticism:
  While Passage A does suggest that insider trading can be beneficial, it does not advocate for the legalization of insider trading.
  Rather, it argues that insider trading laws should be considered in the context of insider nontrading and the importance of accurate information in stock prices.
  Moreover, the passage does not suggest that all forms of insider trading are acceptable.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading law should not be overly broad and should allow those with accurate knowledge of changing circumstances to act on it. Insiders are people who have special information about a company's activities, including but not limited to, executive officers and directors, brokers and market makers, and government entities that regulate or oversee the particular company whose stock is being traded.
  Passage B argues that insider trading should be prohibited because it undermines investor confidence in the stock market and makes it harder for average investors to make money.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage A argues that insider trading law should not be overly broad and that insiders should be allowed to use accurate knowledge of changing circumstances to act on the market. In contrast, the author of passage B argues that insider trading should be prohibited because it undermines the transparency of the market, leading to a loss of investor confidence and ultimately hurting the market as a whole. 
  Option A prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which is similar to the insider-trading law described in passage A. 
  Option B legalizes most trading based on analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is also similar to the insider-trading law described in passage A. 
  Option C prohibits trading that undermines investor confidence, which is closer to the position in passage B. 
  Option D legalizes selling based on inside information but prohibits buying on inside information, which is not related to the argument made in either passage A or B. 
  Option E legalizes trading based on inside information, which is not consistent with the argument made in either passage A or B.
  Thus, option A and B are the most closely related to passage A.
Criticism: 
  The insider-trading law described in passage A makes a distinction between insider trading based on accurate knowledge of changing circumstances versus insider trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. Option B legalizes most trading based on analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. It does not make the distinction that passage A emphasizes. Thus, option A is a better fit with the argument made in Passage A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law can undermine the efficiency and transparency of the stock market.
  The author of passage A argues that spreading knowledge about changing circumstances, even if it involves selling a stock based on inside information, can help improve the accuracy of stock prices.
  Passage B argues that insider trading unfairly compromises the stock market by giving some people an unfair advantage and undermining investor confidence.
Thought:
  The author of passage A argues that a functioning stock market requires people to have access to the same information, so a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone would conform most closely to this position.
  A law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company would still allow for insider trading based on non-public information.
  A law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising would still allow for insider trading, and would not conform as closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A as choice A.
  A law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means, would not conform to the position articulated by the author of passage A, who argues that insider trading can undermine the transparency of the market.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The author of passage A argues that insider-trading law could negatively impact the efficient functioning of the stock market, which is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and using it to profit. 
  The author of passage B argues that insider-trading causes an unfair advantage and compromises the transparency of the market, which ultimately undermines investor confidence and could destroy the market.
Thought:
  The author of passage A argues that insider trading is a necessary part of a functioning stock market and that insiders should be allowed to act on information that others don't have if it would help correct a mispricing of a security. 
  The author suggests that insider nontrading is a widespread practice that also contributes to market efficiency and should be permitted. 
  Based on this, the law that is most closely aligned with passage A but not passage B would likely be one that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  This would acknowledge the importance of properly analyzing the market and allow individuals to act on their knowledge, but at the same time prevent insiders from unfairly profiting from their position and causing harm to investor confidence. 
  Choice B aligns most closely with this position.
Criticism:
  It is important to note that while insider-trading could contribute to market efficiency, it could also harm the integrity of the market and cause unfair advantages. 
  Therefore, any law addressing insider-trading must strike a balance between efficiency and fairness.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should allow people with accurate information about changing circumstances to act so that stock prices reflect them.
  Passage A suggests that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  Passage A argues that insider nontrading - stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge - are just as prevalent as insider trading.
  Passage B states that transparency is one of the basic principles of the stock market.
  Passage B suggests that insider trading causes people with inside information to make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market.
  Passage B argues that undermining investor confidence would deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Thought:
  Passage A argues that people should be allowed to trade based on changing circumstances so that stock prices reflect more accurate assessments of all the relevant facts.
  None of the options exactly fit with the position articulated by the author of passage A
  Option A suggests prohibiting trading based on non-shared information which contradicts passage A's argument.
  Option B suggests permitting trading based on analysis but prohibiting trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. While this option partially aligns with A's argument, it still doesn't entirely conform to the position articulated by the author of passage A.
  Option C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investor confidence. This option may partially align with Passage B's argument but also doesn't entirely conform to the position articulated by the author of passage A.
  Option D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which doesn't match either of the author's positions.
  Option E legalizes trading based on inside information, but the author of passage A is not advocating for completely legalizing insider trading.
  Based on these facts, there is no clear option that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that there are times when it is acceptable to trade on inside information, as long as that information is generally available, and the resulting trades will help to keep the market transparent and accurate.
  Passage B argues that transparency is essential to the stock market, and that allowing insiders to trade on information not available to the public threatens that transparency, potentially undermining investor confidence and harming the entire market.
Thought:
  The author of Passage A believes that it is important to permit trading based on information that is generally available, even if it is not yet known by everyone. This helps keep the market transparent and accurate, and ultimately benefits everyone.
  Answer choice (B) comes closest to this position, as it permits trading based on analysis, but restricts trading based on inside information.
  Answer choice (A) would prohibit all trading based on non-public information, which would be more restrictive than the author of Passage A suggests is necessary.
  Answer choice (C) would prohibit trading that could undermine investor confidence, but this is not necessarily the same as trading based on generally available information.
  Answer choice (D) distinguishes between buying and selling based on inside information, but does not specifically address whether that information is generally available, so it is not a good match for the position taken in Passage A.
  Answer choice (E) would permit trading based on inside information as long as it was not obtained through unlawful means, which is more permissive than the position articulated in Passage A.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should allow trading based on information that is not exclusive to insiders and should permit selling if the trader has information that the stock's value will drop.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading is unfair because those without inside information cannot compete with those with inside information, and that such trading undermines investor confidence and harms the market.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that trading based on knowledge that is not exclusive to insiders should be allowed. So, A and B are not right.
  Passage A also suggests that selling a stock that is overvalued based on analysis should be allowed. So, C and E are not right.
  Passage A also argues that selling a stock based on inside information that the stock's value will drop should be allowed. So, D is not right.
  Therefore, the answer is A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
Criticism: 
  The answer provided is not supported by the information in both passages.
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible. And, it suggests that insider-trading laws should allow trading based on information that is not exclusive to insiders and should permit selling if the trader has information that the stock's value will drop.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading is unfair because those without inside information cannot compete with those with inside information which undermines investor confidence and harms the market.
  Thus, neither passage supports an answer that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law that prohibits trading based on information that you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company is not necessary for a functioning stock market.
  Passage A suggests that the stock market works best when all relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible and insider nontrading could potentially undermine the market.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading undermines the transparency of the stock market and causes a loss of investor confidence, which can ultimately destroy the market. 
  Passage B suggests that insider-trading is unfair because people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. 
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that trading based on information that you have which is not shared by everyone is not illegal. 
  It suggests that insider nontrading is better than insider-trading because it ensures that all relevant information is spread widely. 
  Hence, a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism: 
  None 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law may interfere with the functioning of stock markets, and that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread widely as quickly as possible. It also argues that insider nontrading happens regularly and this doesn't raise any issues.
  Passage B argues that transparency is an essential principle of stock markets, and insider trading compromises the market. It also argues that undermining investor confidence could cause widespread financial repercussions.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock should not be prohibited. It also suggests that selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping can help ensure that stock prices reflect more accurate information about a company's value.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the market and investor confidence, and suggests that transparency is essential to the proper functioning of a stock market.
  Of the choices available, only choice B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. It is similar to passage A's arguments in that it allows for the use of information gained through research while regulating the use of privileged information.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Criticism: 
  None.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative disease caused by a new type of pathogen, called prions.
  Prions are a type of protein pathogen that lack nucleic acid, and have the ability to reproduce by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, and occur naturally in the body as proteins.
  The body does not produce an immune response when prions are present.
Thought: 
  The passage provides the most support for the idea that prions are different from other pathogens because they lack nucleic acid, and are able to propagate themselves through the transformation of normal proteins into a pathological conformation.
  The passage does not support the notions that CJD can only be transmitted through the injection of abnormally shaped prions; that most infectious diseases were previously thought to be caused by other pathogens and are now thought to be caused by prions; that abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD if they were unable to reproduce; or that Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by a conformation of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  The passage also does not provide enough information to determine whether prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called "prion," which is responsible for causing a degenerative form of dementia in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  Prions are disease agents that consist mainly, if not exclusively, of protein and lack nucleic acid.
  Prions normally exist as harmless proteins in many of the body's tissues but possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape.
  Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, causing cellular destruction.
  CJD is inevitably fatal, and there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
Thought:
  CJD is caused by a new type of pathogen called prion.
  Prions lack nucleic acid and reproduce themselves in an unusual way by inducing normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Therefore, the statement that if abnormally shaped prions were unable to reproduce themselves, they would not cause CJD is supported by the passage.
  Thus, the most strongly supported choice is C.
Criticism:
  There is no support in the passage for choices A, B, D, or E.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called prions and their link to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  CJD is a degenerative form of dementia in humans that causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes and its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins but possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape, which can transform normal prions into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions cause CJD by reproducing themselves through initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation, leading to the destruction of nerve cells.
Thought: 
  CJD is caused by prions, a new type of protein pathogen that is different from other known pathogens.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins, but can transform into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation that leads to CJD.
  Abnormally shaped prions cause CJD by reproducing themselves through initiating a chain reaction, indicating that if they were unable to reproduce themselves, they would not cause CJD.
  There is no evidence to support the claim that other infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  According to the passage, it is possible that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, but this possibility has yet to be fully explored.
  The passage does not provide any evidence to suggest that prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Therefore, the answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD. 
Criticism: 
  You are correct that prions cause CJD through reproducing themselves by initiating a chain reaction and transforming normal prions into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. 
  However, it is not supportable to claim that other infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions or that prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Action: Answer("C")

  The passage provides details about prions, their link to CJD and other neurological conditions, and their characteristics as an infectious pathogen. 
  A: The passage does not mention this method of transmission for CJD.
  B: The passage mentions that prions were believed to be the only agents responsible for infections until recently when they were discovered as a new type of infectious pathogen causing CJD. It does not imply that most infectious diseases are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: The passage supports this statement, as it explains that prions can reproduce themselves and induce other normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation. The cascade of transformations produces a plaque that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.
  D: The passage notes the possibility that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, it does not suggest that these diseases are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration, a movement of African Americans from the Southern U.S. to the industrial North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by multiple factors including increased labor demand in the North during World War I, a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and recruitment efforts by Northern employers.
  The continued momentum of the Great Migration was likely due to reduced migration costs and difficulties for later migrants facilitated by earlier migrants.

  Option A correctly summarizes the event of the Great Migration, but does not capture the reasons why it occurred or the factors behind its duration.
  Option B highlights some of the catalysts behind the Great Migration, but does not discuss its continued momentum or factors that facilitated migration.
  Option C highlights a factor that facilitated the continued momentum of the Great Migration, but does not fully capture the range of such factors.
  Option D provides a succinct summary of the main argument in the passage: that earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  Option E highlights a potential criticism of the passage that other factors besides income differences must be cited to explain the duration of the Great Migration.
  Thus, the correct answer would be D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration, the movement of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by increased labor demand in the North due to World War I, reduced demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and Northern employers sending labor agents to recruit African Americans in the South.
  The Great Migration continued and accelerated due to momentum as current migration reduced the cost and difficulty of future migration, and earlier migrants reduced the physical and cultural costs of migration for later migrants.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration and its causes, as well as why it continued and accelerated over time.
  The main point seems to be that earlier migrants during the Great Migration reduced the physical costs and cultural difficulties of migration for later migrants, which helped to create momentum and lead to the continued and accelerated migration of African Americans to the North.
  Therefore, the best answer choice is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Criticism: 
  Other answer choices also accurately reflect the content of the passage, but they do not capture the main point as well. 
  Answer A is accurate but does not capture the reasons for the Great Migration or its continued duration.
  Answer B is accurate but does not address the continued and accelerated migration or the role of earlier migrants.
  Answer C partially captures the role of earlier migrants in reducing the financial costs of migration, but it misses the point about the cultural and linguistic cushion they also provide.
  Answer E is accurate but does not capture the main point about the role of earlier migrants.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")

The passage discusses the Great Migration, the movement of African Americans from the Southern US to the Northern industrial cities between 1915 and 1960. It explains that the migration was triggered by increased labor demand in the North due to World War I and reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, but also argues that later migrants were aided by earlier migrants who helped reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural cushion. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that in migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants. Choice D accurately expresses this main point.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")

The main point of the passage is that earlier migrants in a migration movement reduce the costs and difficulties for later migrants. This is supported by historical evidence of the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915 and 1960. The passage explains that the Great Migration was triggered by various factors, including an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, but it focuses more on why the migration continued and accelerated in subsequent decades. The passage suggests that migration develops momentum over time as more people migrate, and that earlier migrants pass on information, reduce physical costs, and provide a cultural cushion for later migrants. Therefore, the best answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915-1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by several factors including World War I, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and recruitment efforts by Northern employers.
  The initial reason for the migration was the income differential between the North and South, but the duration and acceleration of the migration can be explained by the reduced costs and cultural cushion provided by earlier migrants. 
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915-1960 and identifies several factors that triggered the migration. 
  While these factors explain the initial start of the migration, the duration and acceleration of the migration can be explained by the reduced costs and cultural cushion provided by earlier migrants.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants. 
  The answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Criticism: 
  You could argue that while the passage certainly discusses the role of earlier migrants in reducing the costs of migration for later migrants, this is not necessarily the main point of the passage. 
  Instead, the main point could be seen as the explanation for the duration and acceleration of the Great Migration despite the narrowing North-South income gap. 
  However, this explanation is given in the context of the reduced costs and cultural cushion provided by earlier migrants, so you could also argue that the main point is still best expressed by choice D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration, which was the movement of approximately 40 percent of the African American population from the Southern United States to the industrial cities of the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by several factors, including increased labor demand in the North due to World War I, a boll weevil infestation in the South, and the cutoff of immigration to the United States due to the war in Europe.
  Once the Great Migration began, it developed momentum over time, with earlier migrants reducing the cost and difficulty of migration for later migrants.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration, which was triggered by multiple factors, including increased labor demand in the North due to World War I and a boll weevil infestation in the South.
  Once the Great Migration began, it developed momentum over time because earlier migrants reduced the cost and difficulty of migration for later migrants. 
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the Great Migration was triggered by multiple factors, but its duration and acceleration were due to the reduction of cost and difficulty for later migrants by earlier migrants.
  The answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage discusses the Great Migration, which was triggered by multiple factors and developed momentum over time due to earlier migrants reducing the cost and difficulty of migration for later migrants. 
  However, the passage does not express that the Great Migration lasted for several decades necessarily. 
  So, the answer could also be C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the North accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing. 
  Both options D and C accurately express the main point of the article.
Action: Answer("D") or Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")

The main point of the passage is to explain why the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North of the United States continued and expanded over several decades. The passage argues that the earlier migrants helped reduce the difficulties and costs of migration for later migrants by passing information about housing and labor-market conditions, reducing physical costs, and providing a cultural and linguistic cushion. The passage also suggests that once started, migration develops momentum over time. Therefore, the correct answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was initiated by factors such as increased labor demand in the North during World War I and reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  The passage proposes that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration.
  The passage suggests that earlier migrants reduced the financial and physical costs of migration for later migrants and provided them with housing, food, and cultural support.

  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the North between 1915 and 1960, which was initiated by factors such as increased labor demand in the North during World War I and reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  The passage proposes that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration, and suggests that earlier migrants reduced the financial and physical costs of migration for later migrants and provided them with housing, food, and cultural support.
  The main point of the passage is that the Great Migration was triggered by specific factors, but its duration was influenced by social network mechanisms that reduced the costs and impediments of migration for later migrants.
  Choice A is incorrect because it only summarizes a single aspect of the passage without addressing the social network mechanisms that facilitated migration across several decades.
  Choice B is incorrect because it only identifies the catalysts of the Great Migration without addressing its duration and causes of acceleration in later decades.
  Choice C is correct because it summarizes the social network mechanisms proposed in the passage that facilitated the momentum and acceleration of the Great Migration.
  Choice D is incorrect because it only identifies the physical and cultural support provided by earlier migrants without summarizing the broader mechanisms of social networks described in the passage.
  Choice E is incorrect because it describes a conclusion that is already mentioned in the passage, and is not the main point of the passage.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not suggest that income differences ceased to be a factor in the duration of the Great Migration, but rather that social networks facilitated migration even as the income differences narrowed.
  Therefore, choice C is slightly overstated in claiming that the Great Migration accelerated "at a time when income differences were narrowing," as income differences remained salient throughout the duration of the migration.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Answer: D
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern U.S. to the industrial North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by multiple factors, including increased labor demand in the North due to World War I, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and Northern employers' recruitment of African American labor in the South.
  Once the Great Migration began, it developed momentum over time due to earlier migrants reducing the difficulty and cost of future migration.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern U.S. to the industrial North between 1915 and 1960, and explains why the migration continued and even accelerated despite narrowing income differences between the North and South.
  The author argues that earlier migrants reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration by providing information about labor- and housing-market conditions, reducing physical costs, providing temporary housing, food, and even credit, and providing a cultural cushion for later migrants.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that earlier migrants played a significant role in reducing the difficulty and cost of future migration during the Great Migration.
  The answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Criticism: 
  This is a fair interpretation of the passage, but it may not capture all of the nuances of the author's arguments.
  The author also discusses the initial triggers of the Great Migration, such as increased labor demand in the North due to World War I and reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  However, the author ultimately emphasizes the role of earlier migrants in reducing the difficulty and cost of future migration.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Insider trading involves using information that is not available to all market participants to make buying/selling decisions.
  Transparency is a basic principle of the stock market, where information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time.
Thought:
  Passage A argues that information asymmetry is not inherently bad because it is part of the stock market functioning, but insider trading (i.e., using non-public information) could be problematic because it involves using unfair information to make an investment decision.
  Passage B emphasizes the importance of transparency, as investors believe they can make money if they have enough information, and undermining investor confidence could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
  The authors of both passages would likely agree that insider trading, which creates an information advantage for some market participants, tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
  The authors would also agree that transparency is key for the market to function properly.
  However, Passage A does not argue that all information should be available to all market participants at the same time, while Passage B does.
  Passage A believes that it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis, while Passage B does not address this issue.
  Neither passage discusses the regulation of insider nontrading, so it is unclear whether the authors would agree that it should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading.
  Neither passage argues that insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage A argues that insider trading is not all bad, because it helps ensure that stock prices reflect more accurate assessments of all the relevant facts.
  The passage B argues that transparency is necessary for a well-functioning stock market, and insider trading unfairly compromises the market.
Thought: 
  The authors of passage A and passage B have opposite views about insider trading.
  The authors of passage A argue that insider trading can be beneficial if it helps disseminate information.
  The authors of passage B argue that insider trading undermines investor confidence, and only skill in analyzing available information should determine success in the stock market.
  Both authors agree that transparency in the stock market is important for investor confidence and a well-functioning market.
  The question asks us what the authors would most likely agree on.
  Based on the passages, the authors would most likely agree that "all information should be available to all market participants at the same time" (choice B).
Criticism: 
  The authors of passage A seem to condone insider trading, as long as it helps disseminate information.
  The authors of passage B seem to condemn insider trading and argue that it should be regulated.
  So, a better answer might be that both authors would most likely agree that insider trading should be regulated or restricted to some extent.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws can sometimes be counterproductive because they prevent people with accurate information about changing circumstances from acting on that information and helping stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. 
  Passage B argues that the basic principle of the stock market is transparency, and that insider-trading undermines investor confidence by allowing some people to make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have.
Thought:
  Both passages agree that the stock market should be a transparent marketplace where everyone has access to the same information.
  However, Passage A argues that insider-trading laws can sometimes be counterproductive because they may prevent people with accurate information from acting on it and help ensure stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading undermines investor confidence by allowing some people to make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have.
  Therefore, they would most likely agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
  The answer is A: Insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely and quickly as possible, and that insider-trading laws can be counterproductive to this goal. It suggests that insider nontrading is a far more widespread practice and points out that its regulation would be absurd.
  Passage B argues that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market and that insider-trading undermines this principle. It suggests that insider-trading compromises the market and could ultimately lead to financial repercussions.
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B have differing views regarding insider trading. However, they would both agree that transparency is a fundamental principle of the stock market, and that insider-trading or insider non-trading can undermine investor confidence and compromise the market.
  Therefore, the answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")

  Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  Transparency is one of the basic principles of the stock market.
  In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have, which undermines the transparency of the market.
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law can be complicated and that the ability to trade based on superior stock analysis is an essential part of a well-functioning stock market.
  Passage B argues that insider trading is unfair because some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have and that this undermines transparency, which could destroy the market.
  Both passages agree that transparency is essential for a well-functioning stock market, but that insider trading, or at least the kind of insider trading prohibited by law, is detrimental to transparency and can undermine investor confidence.
  Based on this, the authors would most likely agree that A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: indicate why previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided
  B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events
  C: challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915
  D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain
  E: suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North in the early- to mid-twentieth century. It identifies three catalysts of the Great Migration and proposes that the migration developed momentum over time. The passage also discusses the difficulties and costs of migration and how early migrants reduced those costs for later migrants.
Thought: The last sentence of the second paragraph begins with the phrase "Thus early migrants provided information." This suggests that the purpose of the sentence is to provide further explanation of how the momentum of the Great Migration developed over time. It discusses how early migrants provided information, transportation, housing, and cultural assistance to later migrants to reduce the difficulties and costs of migration. Therefore, Choice D is the correct answer.
Criticism: None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the causes of the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial cities of the North between 1915 and 1960.
Thought:
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states that the authors propose that, once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. It then explains how early migrants provided information, facilitated travel, and helped new migrants adapt to new surroundings, which reduced the costs of migration over time. 
  The main purpose of this sentence is to explain why migration continued and even accelerated in subsequent decades despite narrowing North-South income differences. Therefore, the answer is B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events.

  The passage discusses the causes and continuation of the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North in the early to mid-twentieth century.
  The last sentence of the second paragraph specifically refers to the role of previous migrants in facilitating subsequent migration.
Thought:
  The sentence in question talks about the ways in which previous migrants helped new migrants, such as by providing them with information and temporary housing.
  This sentence is not challenging a traditional view or presenting an unexplainable fact; rather, it is providing additional information about the continuation of the Great Migration.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of the sentence is to extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events.
  The answer is B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events.
Criticism:
  I do not have any criticisms to my response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial North between 1915 and 1960.
  The first paragraph provides some reasons for the start of the Great Migration, including labor demand in the industrial North and a boll weevil infestation in the South.
  The second paragraph proposes that momentum from the initial migration created a feedback loop that made subsequent migration easier and more likely.
  The last sentence of the second paragraph provides supporting evidence for this feedback loop.
Thought:
  The last sentence of the second paragraph says that previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
  This sentence supports the authors' proposal that previous migration made subsequent migration easier and more likely.
  The sentence does not challenge any traditional views or present any facts that need to be explained.
  The primary purpose of the sentence is to provide supporting evidence for the authors' proposal.
  The answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism:
  The answer is actually not very clear-cut, as the last sentence of the second paragraph does not exclusively serve to present a fact about the Great Migration, but also to provide supporting evidence for the feedback loop that the authors propose.
  However, among all the given choices, D is still the best answer. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North in the early 20th century.
  The Great Migration began in 1915 and was caused by a combination of factors, including labor demand in the North during World War I and reduced labor demand in the South due to boll weevil infestations.
  Migration developed momentum over time as current migration reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration.
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph reads, "Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings." 
  This sentence explains how previous migrants helped to reduce the costs and difficulties of migration for later migrants and to provide a cultural cushion for them.
  The purpose of the sentence is to illustrate how the momentum of migration built up over time as earlier migrants facilitated and encouraged later migration.
  Therefore, the answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that the authors seek to challenge previous research or suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Insects' presence affects the evolution of secondary substances in plants, and some secondary substances are favored because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms or are biochemical defenses against insect enemies.
Thought:
  Primary substances are necessary for plants' growth and proper functioning, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. 
  An object's basic components are necessary for its operation and functioning, while secondary features serve functions such as aesthetics or safety, but are not necessary for operation. 
  Therefore, the best analogous relationship is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism:
  While the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants is similar to the relationship between necessary and non-necessary components in machines, some secondary substances in plants have an important biological function, such as protecting the plant from insects, which cannot be compared to the function of aesthetics in cars.
  Another possible criticism is that the other choices do not relate to the topic of plants and their chemical composition, whereas choice B does relate to machines and their components.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Plants have two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.

  Secondary substances can arise from genetic mutations in individual plants.
  Natural selection favors secondary substances that attract pollinating insects to blossoms or provide defenses against plant enemies.
  Insects evolve ways to circumvent plants' defenses, such as detoxification or avoidance.
Thought: 
  The relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances can be compared to other relationships where there are essential and nonessential components.
  Plants need primary substances for growth and proper functioning; secondary substances are nonessential but provide distinctive tastes and smells, and can deter plant enemies and attract pollinating insects.
  Cars need mechanical components such as engines and transmissions to run; features such as paint and taillights are nonessential but give cars a distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety.
  Therefore, choice B most closely describes a set of relationships that is analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning, whereas the secondary substances are diverse and have no known role in internal chemical processes.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, and are involved in insect-plant interactions.
Thought:
  The primary and secondary substances in plants are related in a way that is analogous to some other set of relationships.
  Option A describes a situation where a backup method is used to provide electrical power for a hospital, which is not analogous to the relationship between primary and secondary plant substances.
  Option B describes a situation where mechanical components are necessary for cars to run, but the features that give cars their distinctive look are not necessary for them to function. Although it is not an exact analogy, it is closer than the other options.

  Similarly, secondary substances give plants their taste and smell, but primary substances are necessary for their growth.
  Answer: B
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for the growth and proper functioning of plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive smells and tastes.
  Secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals.
  Secondary substances arise as a result of genetic mutations in individual plants.
  Secondary substances that survive arise as a result of natural selection.
Thought:
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is being compared to a set of relationships in the answer choices.
  The plants' primary substances are required for their growth and proper functioning, like electrical power is required for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments in hospitals.
  The plants' secondary substances give them their distinctive smells and tastes, like paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety.
  Therefore, the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is most closely analogous to the relationship between automobiles and their mechanical components and features, which are necessary for the car's operation and distinctive look but serve different functions.
  The answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism:
  Your answer seems correct, as it correctly analyzes the relationships between plants, their primary and secondary substances, and the answer choices. 
  You also correctly identify the analogy between the plants' secondary substances and a car's features that give it its distinctive look and serve different functions.
  Therefore, I do not have any criticism of your answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Plants contain primary and secondary substances.
  Primary substances are essential for growth and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are diverse and give plants distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances arise from genetic mutations and are conserved by natural selection if they help the plant survive and reproduce.
Thought:
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is that:
  Primary substances are essential for growth and found in all plants, while secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Just as a car can run without features such as paint and taillights, plants can grow without secondary substances, but these chemicals play a role in the plants' survival and reproduction.
  Therefore, the relationship most closely analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is described by choice B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism:
  The analogy between plants and their primary and secondary substances and cars and their mechanical components and features is not perfect, as primary substances are essential for growth and proper functioning in all plants, while mechanical components are necessary for cars to run, but are not found in every object that has a distinctive look.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Plants have two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Insects play a major role in the development of secondary substances.
  Natural selection favors the survival of plants with secondary substances that deter plant-eating insects.
Thought:
  Primary substances are required for the proper functioning and growth of plants, while secondary substances give them their distinctive tastes and smells.
  This suggests an analogy between primary and secondary substances and the essential and non-essential components of a thing.
  Among the answer choices, option B, which states that mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for cars to run, while features such as paint and taillights contribute to the cars' look and safety, but are not essential, appears to be the most similar to the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Plants contain two main categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning.
  Secondary substances have no known role in internal chemical processes and give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances can arise through genetic mutations and are conserved by natural selection because they provide biochemical defenses against insects and attract pollinating insects to blossoms.
Thought: 
  Plants have two main categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are necessary for plant growth and function, while secondary substances are not necessary for plant growth and function and provide a variety of benefits.
  The relationship between plants and primary substances is like the relationship between automobiles and their mechanical components, where the mechanical components are necessary for the functioning of the automobile.
  The relationship between plants and secondary substances is like the relationship between automobiles and their features, where the features give the automobile its distinctive look and serve various functions, but are not necessary for the functioning of the automobile.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism: 
  The analogy in option B is not a perfect match for the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances, as the mechanical components in an automobile are necessary for the car to run, while primary substances are not necessary for plants to survive. Primary substances are necessary for plant growth and proper function, but plants can still survive without them.
  However, option B is still the closest analogy to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances, as both are essential and nonessential components of a larger system.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses different ways in which art historically was produced by and for political and social elites.
- Taruskin and other sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with art produced in a way that reflects the ideals and way of life of the elite, as it enables them to analyze how such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
Thought:
- The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to a view that art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
- This view is based on the idea that for this kind of art to endure, it must embody the ideals of the elite in some hidden way, even if the elite seemingly disapproved of the work.
- The passage does not suggest that Taruskin believes that the most talented artists historically or today are those whose work reflects or embodies the ideology of the elite.
- The passage also does not suggest that typically artists whose work reflects the ideology of the elite are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
- Finally, while the passage mentions that some talented artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons, it does not suggest that this is a generalizable characteristic of the most talented artists throughout history.
Criticism:
- While the passage discusses Taruskin's position, it does not explicitly state that Taruskin himself holds the view described in choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the ways in which art has been produced by and for political and social elites throughout history.
  Taruskin and other sociohistorical critics examine art produced by the elite to analyze how it embodied the ideology of the elite.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that art produced by and for political and social elites:
  - may embody the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  - can be analyzed to understand the ideology of the elite.
  - may endure even if it goes against the values of the elite.
  Option A is not mentioned in the passage.
  Option B is not supported by the passage.
  Option C is supported by the passage; Taruskin and other critics analyze enduring high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite to argue that it actually supports that ideology in some way.
  Option D is not mentioned in the passage.
  Option E is not supported by the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the two different ways historical art was produced for the elites: commissioning a well-known artist or creating a work that expresses/mirrors the elite's ideals and way of life.
  The second way allows sociohistorical critics to analyze how such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that the second method of creating art for elites allows for sociohistorical analysis, but it does not necessarily suggest any of the choices presented.
  Choice A is not mentioned.
  Choice B is not mentioned.
  Choice C is mentioned in the passage, but it is not specifically tied to Taruskin's view.
  Choice D is not mentioned.
  Choice E is not mentioned.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
Choices:
  A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  D: Most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  E: Dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's success in bringing traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into North American dance.
  Dunham was a pioneer in the field of dance ethnology and used a research-to-performance method to adapt traditional dance forms for use in theatrical performance.
  The prevailing methodology in social research in the 1930s was to maintain complete detachment from the subject of research.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses colleagues in anthropology advising Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Therefore, peers in the field at the time may have agreed that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  The answer is C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide direct support for any of the answer choices, but the closest statement is in fact C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation and her success in bringing traditional dance techniques from certain cultures into the mainstream of North American and European choreography. 
  The passage also discusses Dunham's approach to research and her development of a research-to-performance method to adapt Caribbean dance forms for theatrical performance.
Thought: 
  The question asks what statement about the study of dance the "peers" referenced in the passage would have been most likely to agree with.
  According to the passage, previously dance had been neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists did not understand dance techniques and were not trained in the methods of social research.
  The passage does not suggest that most social scientists misinterpreted dance or that they were preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  The passage also does not suggest that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
  The passage does mention the prevailing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment, which suggests that the "peers" referenced in the passage would have believed that social scientists need not be well-versed in dance traditions to obtain reliable data about them.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Social scientists need not be well-versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not state explicitly what the "peers" referenced in the passage would have agreed with, so it is difficult to determine the most accurate answer.
  The passage suggests that dance had been neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists did not understand dance techniques and were not trained in the methods of social research, but it does not necessarily follow that the "peers" would have believed that social scientists need not be well-versed in dance traditions to obtain reliable data about them.
  It is also possible that the "peers" would have agreed with statement C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision, based on the prevailing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of traditional techniques into modern North American dance through her training in both anthropology and choreography.
  Dunham conducted research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms and was interested in their origins in African culture.
  Dunham's approach to research involved participating in the dances she was observing, which was not advised by her colleagues in anthropology.
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Dunham's approach to research "diverged radically" from prevailing methodology, suggesting that the peers mentioned in line 22 would have disagreed with her approach.
  Additionally, the passage notes that colleagues advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in line 22 would have likely agreed with the idea that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  The best answer is C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not directly address the peers' views regarding the scientific precision of research into dance as a cultural form.
  Rather, the passage suggests that the peers would have disapproved of Dunham's approach to research, which involved participating in the dances she was observing. 
  Therefore, it is possible that the peers would have disagreed with Dunham's approach while still believing that scientific precision in dance ethnology was possible.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how dance was neglected as an area of social research and how Dunham's success was due in part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
Thought:
  The peers mentioned in line 22 are likely to be other social scientists who previously neglected dance as an area of social research.
  The passage suggests that the prevailing view at the time was that social scientists must conduct data gathering from a position of complete detachment, which Dunham diverged from.
  The passage does not suggest that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it (A).
  The passage does not suggest that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them (B).
  The passage does not suggest that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision (C).
  The passage does not suggest that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology (D).
  The passage does not suggest that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection (E).
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's work as a dance ethnologist and choreographer who introduced traditional dance techniques from various cultures into modern North American ballet.
  The passage mentions that previously dance had been neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists were not trained in dance, and experts in dance were not trained in social research methodologies.
  The passage notes that Dunham's success in her research and incorporation of traditional dance techniques was due in part to her approach of actively participating in the dances she was observing.
Thought: 
  The peers referred to in line 22 are likely other social scientists who would have previously neglected dance as a legitimate area of research.
  These peers may have held beliefs similar to those mentioned in the passage about the difficulties of conducting research on dance, and the need for scientific detachment.
  If these peers believed that dance was too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection (choice E), they may have been less likely to pursue dance ethnology as a legitimate area of research.
  Therefore, choice (E) may be the best answer.
Criticism: 
  While choice (E) may be a plausible answer, it is not explicitly mentioned in the passage that peers believed that dance was too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
  Additionally, the passage suggests that dance had been neglected as an area of social research primarily because of a lack of training and expertise in both dance and social research methodologies, rather than a belief that dance was inherently unscientific or difficult to study.
  Therefore, choice (E) may not be the best answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Katherine Dunham was an African American choreographer who introduced dance-isolation technique into mainstream North American dance by incorporating traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures.
  Dunham was an anthropologist in the 1930s and was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time, which was to conduct data gathering from a position of complete detachment.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that Dunham's colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too involved in the dances she was observing. 
  They believed effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  This suggests that Dunham's methodology was in contrast to the prevailing methodology at the time.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that 'social scientists need to be detached from the subject they are observing to obtain reliable data about them'.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism:
  There is no information in the passage that suggests social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it (choice A)
  The passage suggests the opposite of choice C. Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time, which was to conduct data gathering from a position of complete detachment.
  There is no information in the passage that suggests experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology (choice D).
  There is no information in the passage that suggests dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection (choice E).
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's contributions to North American dance.
  Dunham was a trained anthropologist and dancer.
  Dunham conducted research into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their African origins.
  Dunham's research-to-performance method adapted Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
  The "peers" mentioned in line 22 refer to social scientists who did not consider dance as an area of social research.
  The statement that would most likely agree with peers' perspective is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  This is because social scientists during Dunham's time did not believe that dance was an area of social research. They were more concerned with areas that were considered scientifically rigorous and legitimate to their peers. Therefore, they would likely not believe that expertise in dance traditions was necessary to obtain reliable data.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of the dance-isolation technique into North American and European choreography, her success in bringing traditional dance techniques from certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into modern North American dance, and her approach to research as an anthropologist in the field of dance ethnology. 
Thought: 
  The "peers" mentioned in line 22 would likely have shared the prevailing view at the time that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment, and therefore would be more likely to agree with statement B than with statements A, C, D, or E. Statement B suggests that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions to obtain reliable data, which aligns with the detached approach to research that was popular at the time.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of the dance-isolation technique and her success in bringing traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance.
  As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham conducted research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms with special interest in their origins in African culture.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that social scientists in the past were not well versed in dance traditions and did not have the training or understanding needed to obtain reliable data about them.
  The passage also suggests that colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with option B: social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not directly state that the peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with option B, although it does suggest that the prevailing methodology in the field of anthropology did not prioritize an anthropologist's ability to understand dance techniques or become physically involved in the dances they were observing.
  Therefore, option B remains the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of dance-isolation technique from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures to North American and European choreography.
  Dunham's success is attributed to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology and her approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
Thought: 
  The "peers" mentioned in line 22 are intended to refer to social scientists who neglected dance as an area of social research.
  The passage contrasts Dunham's approach to research with the methodology that was prevalent at the time, suggesting that this methodology did not recognize dance as a legitimate area of social research.
  Therefore, it is likely that the peers of these social scientists would have agreed with the statement that "social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them."
  Answer choice B best reflects this statement.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passages discuss the relationship between income, comparison to others, and happiness.
  Passage A discusses that people compare their income to some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income, and people are happy if their relative position improves.
  Passage B discusses that people feel happier if they feel successful and have created value, rather than just having money, and scholars often portray material wealth and desire to have more than others as a desire to create value.
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between income, comparison to others, and happiness.
  Neither passage implies any value judgement on a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  The authors of Passage B would most likely describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as altruistic, according to their theory that wanting to create value benefits society and using material wealth to demonstrate that they are prosperous because they create value.
  However, there is no indication in Passage A of how the authors would describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Therefore the answer is not A, C, D, or E.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A talks about research on wealth and happiness, and how people compare their income to a norm and the phenomenon of rivalry. It suggests that people are initially happy when they become wealthy, but habituation and rivalry push up the norm, and that people compare their living standards with others. 
  Passage B discusses different theories of why people care about relative prosperity and how earning more money makes people feel successful because it shows that they have created value. It suggests that wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness.
Thought: 
  The question is asking for pairs of terms that would most likely be used to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors. 
  Passage A suggests that people compare their income with others and that their happiness depends on their relative position. 
  Passage B suggests that people who feel successful and create value will be happy. 
  So, the authors of passage A may use terms like egocentric or misguided to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors, while the authors of passage B may use terms like ambitious or motivated. 
  Based on this, none of the choices seem to fit perfectly, but "D: misguided, admirable" might be the best option as it captures the idea that wanting to make more money than others is seen as misguided in Passage A, but as admirable in Passage B insofar as it creates value.
Criticism: 
  The answer is based on the a rather loose interpretation of the passages. The authors of both passages have not used any specific terms or phrases to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors. None of the choices seem to be a good fit. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The two passages explore the relationship between money, success, and happiness.
  Passage A describes the paradox of richer people reporting higher levels of happiness than poorer people.
  Passage A introduces two phenomena that affect our sense of happiness: habituation and rivalry.
  Rivalry is demonstrated through the Solnick and Hemenway study where people chose to earn less money if it meant they were making more than others.
  Passage B challenges the notion that rivalry is driven by a desire for superiority or one-upmanship.
  The author of Passage B argues that the desire for material wealth is actually driven by a desire to create value and be successful.
Thought: 
  The question asks which pair of terms would most likely be used by the authors to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Neither passage uses the exact pair of terms, so we must infer the most likely options based on the content of each passage.
  Passage A introduces the idea of rivalry as a phenomenon that affects our sense of happiness and is demonstrated by the Solnick and Hemenway study.
  Based on this, the authors of Passage A might describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as egocentric, someone who is focused on their own success relative to others.
  Passage B challenges the notion that material wealth is driven by a desire for superiority and instead argues that it is driven by a desire to create value and be successful.
  Based on this, the authors of Passage B might describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as admirable, someone who is motivated to create value for society.
  Therefore, the answer is D: misguided, admirable.
Criticism: 
  While it is possible that the authors of Passage A might describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as egocentric, it is not a term that is explicitly used in the passage.
  Additionally, it is not clear that an egocentric person would necessarily be concerned with making more money than their neighbors.
  Similarly, while the authors of Passage B argue that the desire for material wealth is driven by a desire to create value and be successful, it is not clear that they would describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors as admirable.
  It is possible that a person may want to make more money than their neighbors for less admirable reasons, such as greed or a desire for power.
  Therefore, the most likely answer may be D: misguided, admirable, but it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this inference.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passages discuss research that has been conducted to determine the relationship between income and happiness.
  Passage A discusses two phenomena -- habituation and rivalry -- that push up the norm by which people compare their income and ultimately define their happiness.
  It also discusses the reference group theory and how living standards have soared since 1990 in East Germany, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries.
  Passage B explores why earning more makes people happier and argues that people use material wealth to show not just that they are prosperous, but that they are prosperous because they create value.
Thought: 
  The passages do not explicitly describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors in terms of any of the given pairs of terms.
  However, both passages suggest that people's desire to create value is a key factor in why earning more money can make them happier.
  Passage A refers to the phenomenon of rivalry and people's tendency to choose an option that makes them relatively better off compared to others in their reference group.
  Passage B argues that people use material wealth to show that they are prosperous because they create value, which benefits society.
  Neither passage appears to make a clear value judgment about whether or not this desire to create value is admirable or misguided.
  Therefore, it is difficult to determine what pairs of terms the authors would most likely use to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors. 
  However, given that both passages argue that people's desire to create value is a key factor in why earning more money can make them happier, it seems more likely that the authors would use positive rather than negative terms to describe a person with this desire.
  Of the given options, the only pair of terms that both have a positive connotation are "admirable" and "egocentric."
  Of these, "admirable" seems more likely to be the term used by the authors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A and Passage B are discussing the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  Passage A indicates that people compare their income with others in their society to determine happiness.
  Passage A also mentions that people tend to over-invest in acquiring material possessions at the expense of leisure.
  Passage A explains that makeup of people's reference groups affects their happiness.
  Passage B implies that people who earn more money feel successful, which leads to happiness.
Thought:
  Passage A characterizes the idea of wanting to make more money than your neighbors as a "phenomenon of rivalry."
  Passage A suggests that people's reference groups heavily influence their happiness, indicating that someone who wants to make more money than their neighbors may be considered insular.
  In Passage B, the authors suggest that wanting to make more money than your neighbors is not an egocentric tendency but instead evidence of a desire to create value.
  The language in Passage B is more positive towards those who want to earn more money than their neighbors, suggesting that the authors would be more likely to describe such a person as "admirable."
  Therefore, if the authors of Passage A were describing a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors, they would most likely use the term "insular," and if the authors of Passage B were describing the same person, they would most likely use the term "admirable."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The two passages discuss research on happiness, wealth, and the phenomenon of people desiring higher income relative to their peers, but they approach the topic from different perspectives.
  Passage A considers the problem of comparing oneself to others and the effect of living standards on happiness, presenting the term "rivalry" as a factor that pushes people to want more than their peers.
  Passage B challenges the idea that wanting to have more than others is an ignoble tendency, arguing that it reflects a desire to create value, and supports that view with evidence that people are happier when they feel successful, regardless of their income relative to others'
Thought: 
  Both passages acknowledge that people often desire to earn more than their neighbors, but they disagree on how to characterize that desire.
  Passage A suggests that people engage in rivalry and overvalue material possessions, which can lead to a cycle of wanting more and more, and ultimately detract from happiness.
  Passage B argues that wanting more is natural, and stems from a desire to create value and feel successful. People compare their income to others' because relative prosperity creates a sense of success, and the resulting feelings of happiness are not just from the money, but from the sense of accomplishment and value of success.
  Because neither passage offers a clear pair of terms to describe someone who wants to make more money, it is difficult to say which ones the authors would use. However, "egocentric" (B) seems somewhat consistent with Passage A's negative characterization of the fixation on material possessions that rivals can engender, while "admirable" (D) is consistent with Passage B's view that wanting more reflects a desire to create value and has benefits for society.
  Of the two, "admirable" seems more consistent with both passages, since Passage B explicitly rejects the idea that comparing oneself to others is ignoble or primitive.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the phenomenon of people comparing their income with some norm, which creates a scenario of rivalry. 
  Passage B contradicts the theory that people want to make more money than their neighbors out of the primal urge to demonstrate superiority.
  Rather, people feel happier when they feel successful and create value.
Thought: 
  Both passages suggest that people compare themselves to their neighbors. 
  However, the interpretation of this behavior differs significantly between the two passages. 
  Passage A views the scenario of rivalry as a negative one since people overinvest in acquiring material possessions at the expense of leisure.
  In contrast, Passage B argues that wanting to make more money than one's neighbors could be seen as evidence of a desire to create value, which benefits society.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely use a different pair of terms to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  We cannot determine which specific pair of terms the authors would use, as they do not provide the exact terminology.
  We can only assume that the authors of Passage A would most likely use negative terms (e.g., misguided) to describe such a person, while the authors of Passage B would use more positive terms (e.g., driven).
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The authors of both passages are discussing the relationship between money and happiness, and the role of relative prosperity in individual well-being. 
  Passage A argues that people's happiness depends on how they compare themselves to others, and that the desire to earn more money is driven by the need to keep up with others or surpass them.
  Passage B argues that people's desire to earn more money is rooted in their desire to create value and feel successful, rather than to simply outdo their neighbors.
Thought:
  The question asks us to identify the terms each writer might use to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  Passage A suggests that such individuals are motivated by rivalry and the need to keep up with others in terms of income and social status. 
  Passage B suggests that such individuals are motivated by a desire to create value and feel successful, which may involve earning more money but is not tied solely to the desire to outdo others.
  Neither passage suggests that the person in question is "altruistic" or "primitive," nor do they suggest that the person is "misguided" or "admirable" (these terms are value judgments that do not reflect the tone or content of the passages).
  Passage A does suggest that such individuals may be concerned with their own happiness and well-being, while Passage B suggests that they may be motivated by a desire to benefit society as well as themselves. 
  Neither passage suggests that the individual in question is inherently "insular" or "cosmopolitan," although Passage A does suggest that people tend to compare themselves to others who are most like them.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss research surrounding the relationship between wealth, success, and happiness.
  They explicitly refer to people's tendency to compare themselves to others and to their reference group to determine their level of satisfaction.
  Passage B argues that people want to create value more than they want to have more than others.
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B do not suggest that someone who wants to make more money than their neighbors is insular or cosmopolitan.
  They do not describe this person as altruistic or egocentric.
  While they do discuss happiness in relation to income, they do not describe such a person as happy or miserable.
  Passage B suggests that wanting to create value is a positive thing, implying that the authors probably see someone who wants to make more money than their neighbors as admirable, not misguided.
  They are also not likely to describe this person as lucky or primitive.
  Therefore, the answer is D: misguided, admirable
Criticism: 
  The authors do not actually use the terms "misguided" or "admirable" to describe someone who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  Passage B does not explicitly state that the authors consider this person to be admirable, but they do suggest that wanting to create value is a positive thing.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss research on happiness and wealth.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study in Passage A identifies that people care about their relative position and most feel successful if their earnings are comparatively greater than their reference group.
  Passage B suggests that people want to create value and earnings make them relatively successful, which ultimately leads to happiness.
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that people may be driven by rivalry to make more money than their neighbors. This rivalry would want them to feel superior in comparison to those around them.
  Passage B suggests that people use their earnings as an indication of their success and it is this success that increases happiness.
  Regardless of the source, both passages suggest that people are wanting to work towards making more money.
  Neither passage suggests that a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors is misunderstood or misguided. 
  So, option D is incorrect.
  There is no indication that the desire to make more money than one's neighbors is aligned with a person's luck or is reflective of primitive behavior. 
  These terms are incorrect.
  Neither Passage indicates that there is an element of selflessness or selfishness in a desire to make more money than one's neighbors.
  So, option B is not the most likely option.
  Similarly, there is no reference to a person's geographical preferences.
  Thus, option A is also unlikely.
  There is no support for either happiness or misery associated with the desire to make more money than one's neighbors. 
  Therefore, option C is most likely incorrect.
  Based on the context of both passages, the authors would describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "admirable" as it could potentially suggest that the person is trying to create value and improve society, as stated in Passage B.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: The information in the passage most helps to answer a which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: What laboratory experiments were conducted by Molina or Rowland in their research on CFCs?
  B: What was the estimated concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere in 1 987?
  C: In what year did Molina testify before the U.S. Congress?
  D: Does .any chemical that does not contain chlorine contribute to the destruction of ozone molecules?
  E: Which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone?
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the pioneering research and advocacy of two scientists, Molina and Rowland, on the depletion of the ozone layer due to the use of manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
  It describes how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production in 1974, and they became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response.
Thought: 
  The passage describes the research and advocacy of Molina and Rowland on the depletion of the ozone layer due to the use of CFCs.
  It details how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  It states that Molina estimated the accumulation of five years of global CFC production in 1974, and he became a public advocate for a prompt and proportionate public policy response.
  Therefore, the information in the passage most helps to answer a question about the research and advocacy of Molina and Rowland on the depletion of the ozone layer due to the use of CFCs.
  The question could be "What was the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer according to Molina and Rowland's research?" or "How did Molina and Rowland become public advocates for a policy response to the depletion of the ozone layer?".
  A, B, C, and D are not relevant to the information provided in the passage.
  E is partially relevant, but the passage does not identify any specific constituent element of CFCs as the most damaging to ozone.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
The passage helps to answer the following question:
Question: What was the impact of Molina and Rowland's research on CFCs on public policy?
Answer: The passage indicates that Molina and Rowland's research on CFCs and their impact on the ozone layer led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. Molina was also invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment, which suggests that their research had a significant impact on public policy. Therefore, the best answer is not explicitly stated in the given choices, but it can be inferred from the context. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
The passage helps to answer which one of the following questions:
Choice: E: Which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone?

Explanation: 
The passage discusses how the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when they diffuse into the stratosphere and are subjected to ultraviolet radiation. The passage also shows how the increase in chlorine concentration in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer because chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. Therefore, the passage helps to answer the question about which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the research and advocacy of Molina and Rowland on the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs that contributed to skin cancer.
Thought: 
  The passage provides a lot of information about Molina and Rowland's research and advocacy on the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs. It talks about how they discovered the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer, how CFCs deplete the ozone layer, how long it would take for the ozone layer to recover, and how their advocacy led to the development of an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. 
  None of the choices directly relates to the information provided in the passage. However, we can infer that the passage provides information that is most helpful to answer the question "What was the impact of Molina and Rowland's research and advocacy on the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs?" 
  Therefore, the answer is not explicitly given in the choices, but the closest answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:

  The passage mentions that in 1974, Molina and Rowland estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production.
  The passage also mentions the international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases, which was a result of Molina and Rowland's advocacy efforts.
Criticism:
  The answer could vary based on personal interpretation of the passage, but option B seems to be most closely related to the information provided.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
The passage is most relevant to answer which one of the following questions:
Choice: E: Which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone? 

Explanation: 
The passage discusses the role of manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in depleting the ozone layer. It explains that when CFCs are subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation in the lower atmosphere, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. Therefore, the constituent element of CFCs that is most damaging to ozone is chlorine. Thus, the answer is E: Which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone?
Response 7:
The passage helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery that CFCs contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer.
Thought: 
  The passage primarily discusses the discovery of how CFCs help to deplete the ozone layer and the public policy changes that resulted from Molina and Rowland's research and advocacy. The passage does not give details about the laboratory experiments conducted by Molina and Rowland, nor does it provide an estimate of CFC concentrations in the atmosphere in 1987 or the specific year that Molina testified before Congress. Similarly, the passage does not address whether other chemicals contribute to the destruction of ozone or which element of CFCs is most damaging to the ozone layer. Therefore, the correct answer is not A, B, C, D or E.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
The question that the information in the passage most helps to answer is:
  E: Which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone?
  
Explanation:
  The passage highlights the work of Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, who showed how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) - highly volatile chemicals, chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. The passage also explains how the increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. This information shows that chlorine is the constituent element of CFCs that is most damaging to the ozone layer. Therefore, the correct answer is E: Which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone?
Response 9:
The passage suggests the most appropriate answer that would be helped by the information in the passage is the effect of CFCs on the ozone layer. Therefore, the answer is not any of the options provided.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

  The pairs of passage titles that seem to be discussing two sides of the same issue may be the most analogous. 
  Pair B ('Cameras in the Courtroom: Three Central Issues in the Debate' and 'The Unexpected Benefits of Permitting Cameras in Court') may be discussing the same topic of cameras in the courtroom and offer different points of view on the subject.
Criticism: 
  While Pair B is discussing different aspects of cameras in the courtroom, it is not necessarily discussing two opposing sides. Rather, they could both be seen as supporting the use of cameras in different ways.
  The relationship between passages A and B may not be fully represented by any of the pairs of titles, as the titles are not specific enough to determine the full scope of the passages.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the concept of jury nullification and its potential problems. 
  Passage B discusses how the jury can act as a safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous, and how jury nullification can be viewed as assisting the legislature.
Thought: 
  Passage A and B are related in that they both discuss the role and potential benefits/problems of the jury system in the criminal justice process. 
  The titles of the answer choices suggest that they may be related in a similar way.
  Option A suggests a debate around the pros and cons of televising courtroom proceedings.

  It is possible that Passage A and Passage B are related in a different way than a discussion of central issues.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the concept of jury nullification and the potential problems of the jury having this power.
  Passage B discusses the potential benefits of the jury having the power of nullification and how it can act as a check on overzealous police and prosecutors.
Thought:
  The question is asking for the pair of document titles that have a relationship similar to the relationship between Passage A and Passage B.
  Passage A and Passage B both address the topic of cameras in the courtroom but take opposing viewpoints on the issue, with Passage A arguing against cameras and Passage B arguing in favor of cameras.
  Therefore, the correct pair of document titles will discuss a single topic from opposing viewpoints.
  Choices A, C, D, and E do not fit this pattern, as they do not discuss the same topic from opposing viewpoints.
  Choice B fits the pattern, as both documents discuss cameras in the courtroom but take opposing viewpoints on the issue.
Criticism:
  While the topic of camera in the courtroom and nullification are both legal topics, it is unclear whether the relationship between Passage A and Passage B is directly related to the relationship between the titles of the other documents.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the topic of jury nullification, with A presenting arguments against it, and B presenting arguments in favor of it.

Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B present contrasting arguments about whether the power of jury nullification is problematic or useful.
  Both passages are about the role of juries in the legal system, but they focus on different issues and present different perspectives.
  Therefore, the relationship between these passages could be compared to a pair of documents discussing different aspects of allowing cameras in the courtroom.
  For example, one passage might focus on the negatives of cameras, while the other could focus on the potential benefits.
  This would be similar to the relationship between A and B because although they discuss the same topic, they present opposite viewpoints and explore different facets.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses jury nullification in criminal cases and raises concerns about the problems that arise when juries have the power to nullify verdicts. It argues that juries are not legislators and may lack sufficient evidence to make informed nullification decisions. 
  Passage B discusses the potential benefits of jury nullification, such as providing a safety valve and indicating to the legislature that a law may be unjust. It argues that nullification is uncommon and requires a compelling case for all twelve jurors to agree.

Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss the concept of jury nullification, but they have different perspectives.
  Passage A argues that the power of nullification can lead to problems and challenges the legitimacy of this jury power.
  Passage B argues that the power of nullification can have benefits that can assist the law and is not a major concern.
  Therefore, the relationship between Passage A and Passage B can be described as "Opposing Perspectives on the Power of Jury Nullification."

Evaluation:
  The answer choice E might seem as it is expressing opposing opinion regarding cameras in courtroom, while both passages discuss potential benefits and drawbacks of the same topic. However, the relationship between the passages is not simply discussing the pros and cons of jury nullification, but rather the opposing perspectives on the power of jury nullification. Thus, E is not the correct answer. 
  A is incorrect because, based on their titles, they seem to support different sides of the debate on the issue of televising courtroom proceedings. 
  B is incorrect because while both passages discuss cameras in the courtroom, they focus on different aspects (one on the pros and cons, the other on central issues in the debate). 
  C and D are incorrect because they both focus on the history of cameras in the courtroom and their motives.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, specifically primary and secondary substances, and their functions.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Some secondary substances scents that attract pollinating insects, while others that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants.
  There has been an evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects for advantage.
Thought: 
  Secondary substances play important roles in the lives of various kinds of plants and certain species of insects.
  Some of the secondary substances play vital roles in attracting pollinating insects to blossoms.
  Other secondary substances form part of the biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants.
  Insects that feed exclusively on certain plants have evolved ways to identify those plants by their characteristic flavors or odors.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
Criticism: 
  No information supports answer choice B. 
  Answer choice C contradicts the information provided in the passage. The passage states, "They (insects) may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner."
  Answer choice D is not supported by the information provided in the passage because some secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection.
  Answer choice E is not supported by the information provided in the passage because it is not discussed.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes primary and secondary substances found in plants.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive taste and smell and are found in related plants.
  Secondary substances are a defense mechanism for plants against insects.
  Insects may evolve ways to circumvent these defenses.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how secondary substances in plants serve as a defense mechanism against insects.
  Insects have evolved ways to circumvent the plant defenses, and as a result, only a few plants are suitable for any one species of insect.
  The passage does not provide evidence to infer that most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  Therefore, we can eliminate option B.
  The passage does not provide information to infer that most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  Therefore, we can eliminate option C.
  The passage describes how secondary substances that are toxic to insects have evolved in various unrelated species of plants but have survived in only a few species.
  Therefore, option D is possible.
  The passage explains how secondary substances arise as a result of genetic mutations in individual plants and that new ones continue to appear.
  Secondary substances that arise from genetic mutations are a type of chemical substance not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant.
  Therefore, option A is possible.
  The passage does not support the idea that some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances, so we can eliminate option E.
Criticism: 
  Option A is a better answer than option D because it is more directly supported by the passage. Option D implies that most secondary substances that are toxic to insects have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but have survived in only a few species. However, the passage does not provide evidence to support the idea that only a few species have survived after producing secondary substances toxic to insects.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
- Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
- Secondary substances are chemical substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
- Only a few secondary substances occur in any one plant species.
- Secondary substances arose as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants.
- Secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they have biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants.
- Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die.
- Some secondary substances are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other harmful substances.
Thought:
- The passage discusses the roles of primary and secondary substances in plants, with a focus on secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and have biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, including insects.
- The passage suggests that secondary substances were conserved by natural selection because of their role in defense against insects and that insects have evolved ways to circumvent these defenses.
- None of the answer choices seem to fit perfectly with the passage, but the answer that comes closest is B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
Criticism:
- Choice A is not accurate because the passage states that some secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism but play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants, not in any one particular kind of plant.
- Choice C is not supported by the passage, which states that insects identify plants by their characteristic flavors or odors.
- Choice D is not directly supported by the passage, which does not discuss the evolution of toxic substances in unrelated species of plants.
- Choice E is not directly supported by the passage, which does not discuss toxic substances that are not secondary substances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two categories of chemical substances found in plants: primary and secondary.
  Secondary substances give plants their characteristic tastes and smells.
  Insects have played a role in the evolution of many plants.
  Some secondary substances are defenses against plant-eating insects.
  Insects that can circumvent plant defenses develop an association with those plants.
Thought:
  The passage states that some secondary substances are defenses against plant-eating insects and that insects that can circumvent defenses develop a preference for those plants.
  Therefore, it is likely that most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species might still be used as food by other insect species that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  The passage says nothing about most insects being able to identify plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell, so we can eliminate choice C.
  The passage mentions that a few secondary substances evolved independently in various species of plants, but the text does not support the idea that many toxic substances like these are thought to have survived only in a few species, so we can eliminate choice D.
  The passage does not provide information that would support the notion that some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants, so we can eliminate choice A.
  While the passage does confirm that some toxic substances are produced independently of secondary substances, the question is not asking about this relationship. Thus, we can eliminate choice E.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, including primary and secondary substances.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, and some secondary substances are biochemical defenses against plant enemies, while others dissuade insects from feeding.
  Insects have played a role in many plants having the secondary substances they have today.
Thought:
  A: The passage says some secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth and metabolism, but they give plants their distinct tastes and smells, and some chemical substances play vital roles in plant-insect interactions, suggesting that A is a possible answer.
  B: The passage supports the idea that as plants and insects have coevolved, plants have developed defenses against insects that have evolved ways to circumvent those defenses, suggesting that B could be a possible answer.
  C: The passage does not provide evidence to support the idea that most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: The passage does say that some secondary substances that are toxic to insects have evolved independently in unrelated species of plants and that fewer plants are becoming suitable food sources for insects as they develop defenses, which suggest that D is a possible answer.
  E: The passage does support the idea that some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.
After critically evaluating each option, both A and D are supported by the passage. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how plants have evolved a variety of chemicals, including secondary substances, that contribute to their taste and smell.
  Secondary substances can act as biochemical defense against insects, but some insects are able to circumvent these defenses.
  Some secondary substances act as scents to attract pollinating insects.
  The passage does not discuss the toxicity of specific secondary substances in unrelated species of plants.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that secondary substances that are not involved in the growth or metabolism of plants can play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants. 
  It also suggests that some insects have evolved ways of circumventing the chemical defenses of plants, even if the plant produces these chemicals specifically as defensive substances against insects.
  However, there is no support for the claim that most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than taste or smell, so Choice C can be eliminated.
  The passage does not discuss the toxicity of specific secondary substances in unrelated species of plants, so Choice D can be eliminated. 
  The passage mentions secondary substances that evolved alongside toxic substances, but it does not claim that these toxic substances evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants, so Choice E can be eliminated. 
Criticism:
  The passage does not provide enough support for choice A. While it does mention the role of secondary substances in a variety of plants, it does not provide evidence that these substances play "vital" roles.
  Choice B is the most accurate reflection of the passage. It is a central theme of the passage that while plants evolve chemical defense systems against certain insect species, these defenses are often circumvented by other species of insects.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and how it relates to their taste and smell, and the role of natural selection in the evolution of secondary substances in plants for defense or attraction to pollinating insects.
A: The passage mentions that secondary substances, which are not involved in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth, play a role in giving plants their distinctive tastes and smells, but does not state that they "play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants." The passage does mention that secondary substances can be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants.
B: The passage suggests that some insects are able to circumvent the chemical defenses of certain plants, but does not state that "most plants" are used as food by a wide variety of insects. It also does not suggest that plants have evolved chemical defense systems specifically against insect species.
C: The passage does not support the idea that most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
D: The passage supports the idea that secondary substances in plants that are toxic to insects can arise from genetic mutations in individual plants and survive and be passed on through natural selection. The passage does not suggest that toxic substances evolved independently in unrelated species of plants, but rather that specific secondary substances tend to occur in related plants such as those that constitute a single family. 
E: The passage suggests that some biochemical defenses against insects are not themselves toxic to the insect, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. 

Thought: 
  The passage describes the role of secondary substances in plants in providing distinctive tastes and smells, and the role of natural selection in the evolution of these substances for defense or attraction to pollinating insects. It suggests that some substances that are not directly involved in plant metabolism can have important roles in natural selection. The passage does not provide strong evidence for any of the answer choices, but provides some evidence for the idea that secondary substances that are not toxic to insects can dissuade insects from feeding. 
  Therefore, the best answer is E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms.
  Other secondary substances are conserved by natural selection because they proved to be defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses many roles played by secondary substances in plants. 
  Secondary substances determine a plant's taste and smell and have roles in attracting pollinators or deterring pests.
  The passage suggests that these roles are essential to the survival of many species of plants.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plants play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  The correct answer is A.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains that plants have two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. 
  The primary ones are essential for growth while the secondary ones are diverse, have no known purpose in the plants' internal chemistry and give plants their distinct tastes and smells.
  There has been an evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects with insects adapting to plant defenses.
Thought:
  A is supported in the passage as it mentions that secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes but are vital to plants' lives.
  B is partially true as the passage states that plants develop defense systems with secondary substances against insects, but it does not provide support that most plants are still used as food by a wide variety of insects.
  C is not supported as the passage implies that insects identify plants by their characteristic flavors or odors.
  D is inconsistent with the passage as it describes that secondary substances arose by mutation and were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. 
  E is also not consistent with the passage.
Criticism:
  There is no information in the passage about the toxic substances produced by unrelated species of plants, nor does it suggest that plants produce these substances independently of secondary substances.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemistry of plants and how it relates to insects.
  Primary substances are required for growth and functioning; secondary ones are diverse and give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances can occur in related plant species and can result from genetic mutations.
  Natural selection can favor certain secondary substances as biochemical defenses or as scents that attract pollinating insects.
  Evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects has led to plants developing defenses and insects evolving ways to circumvent them.
Thought: 
  Option A is supported by the passage. The passage discusses how secondary substances have no known role in internal plant processes but play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  Option B is mentioned in the passage as a result of the evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects. Insects that can circumvent a plant's biochemical defenses come to prefer those plants.
  Option C is not supported by the passage. The passage suggests that insects are often able to identify plants by their characteristic flavors or odors and become associated with botanical restricted groups of plants.
  Option D is mentioned in the passage as some toxic substances are thought to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  Option E is not supported by the passage. The passage suggests that toxic substances, whether secondary or not, can be used as biochemical defenses against herbivores.
Criticism: 
  Option A is the best-supported inference from the passage but may be slightly oversimplified. Although some secondary substances have specific functions for a single plant species, others have wider ecological roles.
  Option B is supported by the passage but may be too strong. Many plants have effective biochemical defense systems that limit the types of herbivores they can be used as food by.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the concept of increasing returns to scale, which refers to the idea that the bigger the organization or firm, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more productive and greater output it can achieve per worker.
  A: This choice does not refer to an increase in efficiency due to the scale of the organization or business, so it is not the best answer.
  B: This choice does not describe an increase in efficiency due to the scale of the bee colony.
  C: This choice describes the ability of a school district to utilize a single building to accommodate more students by using year-round operation. However, this choice does not refer to an increase in efficiency due to the scale of the school district, so it is not the best answer.
  D: This choice refers to advances in technology allowing the lobster industry to catch substantially more lobsters per day with the same number of traps. This increase in productivity could represent an example of an increase in efficiency due to the scale of the industry.
  E: This choice describes how two competing ant colonies are able to grow larger than one colony alone, representing an increase in efficiency due to the scale of the ant colonies.
Thought: 
  The question asks for an example of increasing returns to scale, which refers to an increase in efficiency or productivity due to increasing the size or scale of an organization or operation. 
  Choice D correctly describes an industry that is able to catch substantially more lobsters per day with the same number of traps due to advances in technology, which represents an increase in efficiency due to the scale of the lobster industry.
  Choice E describes how two competing ant colonies are able to grow larger than one colony alone, representing an increase in efficiency due to the scale of the ant colonies.
  However, choice D seems to better match the concept of increasing returns to scale as mentioned in the passage, as it describes how technological advances allow an industry to produce more output with the same number of traps.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes increasing returns to scale as a situation where the bigger the business, the more specialized its workers can be.
  Increasing returns often drive smaller firms out of business, leading to fewer competitors.
  The passage argues that free markets require many competitors, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
Thought:
  A describes a situation where fewer editors would lead to lower productivity and is the opposite of the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B describes an example of specialization, but not necessarily of increasing returns to scale.
  C describes a situation where the school district can accommodate more students in one building, but it does not necessarily represent the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  D describes a situation where the same number of traps is used to catch many more lobsters, which represents the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  E describes the situation where two ant colonies can grow larger than one colony and represents the idea of increasing returns to scale.
  Both D and E represent increasing returns, but E is about an ant colony, which is not described in the passage.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. 
Criticism:
  The answer choice E represents increasing returns to scale but is about an ant colony instead of a business. 
  The correct answer should be D, as it best represents the concept of increasing returns to scale that was discussed in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale as "the bigger the [business], the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more [products] the [business] can produce per worker." This concept leads to businesses with increasing returns having a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  A: This answer choice describes a publishing house being able to employ fewer editors. It does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale. 
  B: This answer choice describes a bee colony being able to use some bees as guards to collect more nectar. It does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  C: This answer choice describes a school district being able to accommodate more students in a single building by switching to year-round operation. It does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  D: This answer choice describes the lobster industry being able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps because of technology advances. This seems to illustrate the concept of a business with increasing returns to scale being able to produce more with the same resources. 
  E: This answer choice describes an ant colony dividing and producing multiple colonies that are larger and more prosperous than a single colony. This seems to illustrate the concept of a business with increasing returns to scale being able to produce more with the same resources.
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale means that the bigger the business, the more resources it can allocate to specialized tasks, leading to greater efficiency and output.
  In the lobster industry example, technology advances enable the industry to catch substantially more lobsters with the same number of traps than before.
  In the ant colony example, dividing a colony into multiple colonies creates more ants than could have existed in one colony.
  Both the lobster industry example and the ant colony example illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Of the two examples, the lobster industry example seems more accurate, as the ant colony example does not involve the use of resources in the traditional sense.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
Criticism: 
  The lobster industry example may not be the best choice as it only describes one industry, and has limited scope. 
  Furthermore, technology may not be the only way for businesses to increase returns to scale.
  The ant colony example does illustrate increasing returns to scale by dividing a colony to create more ants with the same resources, but it might not be traditionally seen as a "business."
  However, among the answer choices given, the lobster industry example appears to be the best illustration of the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes a concept called increasing returns to scale.
  The pin factory is an example of increasing returns to scale; the bigger the factory, the more specialized the workers, and the more efficient the factory is.
  Increasing returns lead to a natural tendency towards monopoly.
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale refers to the idea that the bigger a business or organization becomes, the more productive and efficient it can be.
  The bee colony, school district, and ant colony examples do not illustrate this principle.
  The lobster industry example stands out as an example of increasing returns to scale where advances in technology allow the industry to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps.
  Increasing returns to scale naturally lead towards monopolies, so bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
Criticism: 
  The bee colony, school district, and ant colony examples make no reference to economies of scale.
  The lobster industry example, while referencing technology which allows for increased productivity, does not specifically mention economies of scale or that the industry is getting more efficient as it gets bigger.
  There is no direct mention of monopolies in the options, so the argument that the lobster industry leads to monopolies may be interpreted as invalid.
  Therefore, it is important to analyze these options in more detail to determine the best answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale mean that as the scale of production increases, the output per unit of input also increases.
  The passage gives an example of the pin factory, where larger size leads to increased specialization, which in turn leads to increased output per worker.
Thought:
  Option A describes a reduction in productivity, not an increase, so it does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option B describes a case where some bees are dedicated to guarding nectar sources, which increases the collected nectar, but it does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option C describes a way to increase the utilization of a fixed resource, but it does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option D describes a case where the same inputs lead to more production, which is characteristic of increasing returns to scale.
  Option E describes the creation of more colonies, each with different specialization, which increases the total output of the ant population, but it does not directly illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
Criticism:
  There is no obvious flaw in the logic used to arrive at the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  According to the passage, Adam Smith emphasized the idea of "increasing returns to scale" in economic theory.
  When companies have increasing returns to scale, the larger they get, the more specialized and efficient their workers become, and the more output they can create per worker. 
  This results in lower costs and higher revenue for the company.
  Increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency for monopoly since larger companies are more efficient and can produce goods at a lower price.
Thought:
  In option A, the productivity of editors is improved by lowering standards, not by increasing returns to scale.
  In option B, the bee colony produces more nectar by assigning guard bees, but this is not really related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  In option C, the school district is actually sharing resources, but it does not really involve economies of scale.
  In option D, technology allows the lobster industry to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps, leading to increased output and lower costs, which is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  In option E, the ant colony eventually grows large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies, which is also an example of increasing returns to scale.
  However, option D is more directly related to a business or industry, which is the context given in the passage.
  Therefore, the best choice is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. 
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses increasing returns to scale in relation to the pin factory and the struggle between the pin factory and the invisible hand.
  Increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, but for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry.
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale mean that the bigger the business, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more products/outputs it can produce per worker.
  Option A describes decreasing returns to scale, where the productivity of editors increases only when the standards are relaxed, which means that hiring fewer editors becomes possible.
  Option B mentions "a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar," which indicates increasing returns to scale. But the illustration is about the benefits of division of labor.
  Option C talks about increasing the number of students by switching to year-round operation, but it does not say anything about the productivity of workers in the school district. Also, the concept of year-round operation does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option D says advances in technology allow the lobster industry to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps. This is about productivity increasing with technological advances, not necessarily increasing returns to scale.
  Option E talks about a large ant colony dividing into multiple colonies to grow and prosper. This change creates a situation where the ant colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony, indicating increasing returns to scale.
  Thus, option E best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how Adam Smith recognized that increased efficiency could be achieved through increasing the size of a business, which results in increased specialization and production per worker.
  This concept is known as "increasing returns to scale".
  The passage explains that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly because larger firms can achieve economies of scale and lower costs than smaller firms.
Thought: 
  Option A describes a decrease in productivity, so it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale. 
  Option B describes a strategy to better divide labor, which could lead to increased productivity, but it does not involve increased specialization or scale.
  Option C describes a strategy to increase capacity utilization, but it does not involve increased specialization or scale.
  Option D describes an increase in technology that allows the industry to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps, which could be an example of increasing returns to scale. 
  Option E describes how multiple ant colonies grow and prosper, resulting in a larger overall number of ants than could have existed in one colony. This illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, option E is the best answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the concept of increasing returns to scale and the tendency towards monopoly that such increasing returns can create. 
  A: This example describes a reduction in the number of workers and does not involve an illustration of increasing returns to scale.
  B: This example describes how a larger commitment of resources to guarding nectar sources can allow a bee colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony doing other work. This could illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  C: This example involves organizing a building differently so that it can accommodate more students. While this does involve an increase in scale, it is not clear that it demonstrates the increasing returns to scale concept described in the passage.
  D: This example describes technological improvements that allow the lobster industry to catch more lobsters using the same number of traps. This could illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  E: This example describes how a large ant colony divides into multiple smaller competing colonies, which may grow to contain more total ants than the original colony. This could illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Thought:
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale as the idea that the bigger the operation, the more efficient it becomes, leading to lower costs. 
  Two good options are B (large bee colony) and D (technology leading to catch more lobsters with same traps). 
  The bee example involves more efficient collection of nectar, which could be seen as a cost reduction, while the lobster example involves the ability to catch more lobsters, which could also be seen as the result of cost reductions through efficiency.
  The ant example also involves the increase in efficiency and productivity of a larger colony splitting into smaller, potentially more efficient colonies.
  A and C seem to be unrelated to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Thus, options B, D, and E all illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Criticism:
  N/A
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale. 
  According to the passage, increasing returns to scale means that the bigger the company, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more it can produce per worker. 
  This process can lead to natural monopolies, which are contrary to the functioning of a free market. 
Thought:
  A: This scenario does not illustrate increasing returns to scale. 
  B: This scenario does not illustrate increasing returns to scale; it describes how the division of labor can benefit a particular type of work. 
  C: This scenario does not illustrate increasing returns to scale. 
  D: This scenario illustrates increasing returns to scale. When the lobster industry is able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps due to smart techniques or advances in technology, it is able to produce more lobster per worker. 
  E: This scenario does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of clay tablets with cuneiform writing that dates back to 3000 B.C.
  The writing on the tablets uses abstract symbols to represent words, rather than pictographs.
  The sign for "sheep" is a circled cross, rather than an image of a sheep.
Thought: 
  The author of the passage notes that the writing on the tablets uses abstract symbols, such as the circled cross to represent the word "sheep."
  However, the author does not provide any indication that this sign is more or less significant than any other sign.
  Therefore, the author is not likely to agree with option A.
  The author does note that the sign for "sheep" is not a pictograph, but an abstract symbol, unlike the cuneiform sign for "metal," which is a crescent with five lines.
  Therefore, the author would agree that the sign for "sheep" gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning, making option B correct.
  The author does not provide any indication that the way in which the sign for "sheep" represents its meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity, making option C incorrect.
  The author mentions the work of Schmandt-Besserat, who recognized the tokens as predecessors to the written word, but does not make any specific statement about the scientific scrutiny of the sign for "sheep," making option D irrelevant.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of cuneiform tablets in the Sumerian city of Uruk, which could date back to 3000 B.C. 
  The tablets use abstract symbols to represent words and concepts.
  The sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep but rather a circled cross.
Thought: 
  The passage does not offer a clear opinion about the sign for "sheep."
  The author simply notes that the writing on the tablets uses abstract symbols and gives an example of the sign for "sheep."
  Therefore, it is impossible to determine with which statement about the sign for "sheep" the author of the passage would be most likely to agree.
  None of the options accurately represents the author's opinion.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the abstract nature of writing in ancient Sumer.
  The sign for "sheep" in cuneiform is not a pictograph, but rather a circled cross.
Thought: 
  The passage does not provide enough information to clearly support any of the given choices.
  However, given that the passage emphasizes the abstract nature of the writing system, it is unlikely that the author would choose option C, which suggests a more concrete reasoning for the symbol's design.
  Similarly, options D and E are not supported by the passage.
  This leaves options A and B, both of which are possible interpretations of the passage.
  However, since the passage does not draw explicit comparisons between the sign for "sheep" and the sign for "metal," option B is less likely.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with option A, which suggests that the sign could have been replaced without loss of significance.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the writing system of the Sumerian city of Uruk, which dates back to around 3000 B.C.
  The writing system used abstract symbols to represent words, rather than pictographs.
  The sign for "sheep" is described as a circled cross.
Thought:
  The author does not provide enough information to make a specific statement about the sign for "sheep."
  The passage states that the early writing system used abstract symbols to represent words, which would suggest that the specific shape of the sign for "sheep" was not particularly important.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement A, which suggests that the sign could be replaced by another sign without loss of significance.
Action: Answer("A")

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience change the way we think about the law, suggesting that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  Passage B presents a theory of soft determinism and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought: 
  Both passages are concerned with the relationship between neuroscience and the concept of free will, and the implications of this relationship for the criminal-justice system. 
  Passage A argues that neuroscience suggests that the system of retribution is not an effective method of deterrence in preventing further harm. 
  Passage B offers the theory of soft determinism as a way of reconciling determinism with the concept of free will. 
  The passages both agree that actions are not free when they are constrained. 
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience change the way we should think about the law, and the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution as a justification for punishment and instead focus on deterring future harms. This is because what people perceive as free and rational choices could actually be caused by non-rationalities beyond their control, such as the activity in the emotional centers of the brain, and the official line in the law, which is whether someone is rational or not, may not be reliable. 
  Passage B is about free will. It argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained and that the source of the cause, not the existence of a cause, determines whether an action is free. 
Thought: 
  Both passages are concerned with the issue of whether or not human actions are causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. 
  Passage A suggests that neuroscience has found evidence to challenge the official line in the law and the idea of retribution, and the law should focus on deterrence. 
  Passage B argues that free actions are caused by internal sources and that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. 
  Although they come from different angles, both passages are concerned with the question of free will and the extent to which free actions can be determined by internal sources, neuroscience, external factors, or causes one cannot control. 
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
Criticism: None. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that neuroscience suggests retribution is not a suitable justification for punishment and that deterrence should be the focus of the law.
  Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will and suggests that actions from a healthy brain can be considered free.
Thought:
  Both passages are discussing the implications of neuroscience on how we think about actions and punishment.
  Passage A suggests reconsidering the justification of punishment and focusing on deterrence instead of retribution in light of neuroscience findings.
  Passage B suggests that even though determinism exists, actions from a healthy brain can be considered free.
  So, both passages are concerned with answering the question of how scientific research into the brain and determinism can have implications regarding freedom of will and the justification of punishment.
  The answer is B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
Criticism:
  The answer is correct since that is the main question both passages are attempting to answer.
  There are, however, some overlapping points between the different answer options, so some of them might appear to be partially relevant.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses new findings in neuroscience that suggest the way we think about the law should change, abandoning retribution and focusing on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and how it can coexist with determinism.
Thought:
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the law should abandon the concept of retribution and instead focus on deterring future harms. The idea that people are entirely rational and should be punished for freely chosen immoral acts may not be accurate. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and identifies that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, even if they are determined. It suggests that actions originating from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and therefore free.
  Both passages discuss the implications of neuroscience on the law and the concept of free will.

Thought: 
  Both passages are concerned with the question of how neuroscience challenges traditional assumptions about the law, morality, and free will. 
  Passage A argues that we should abandon the traditional justification for punishment/retribution and focus instead on preventing future harm. Neuroscience gives evidence that people's actions are determined by their brains and the environment around them, not solely by their own free will. 
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism, and that actions are free as long as they are not constrained by external factors, not the existence of a cause.

Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest retribution is not a valid justification for punishment. Instead, the focus should be on deterring future harms.
  Passage B argues for the existence of free will, even in a deterministic world. According to Ayer, free actions are those not caused by external sources.
Thought: 
  Both passages seem to be concerned with answering the question of whether recent findings in neuroscience have implications regarding the concept of free will. Passage A argues that the criminal justice system should abandon retribution and focus on deterring future harms, which suggests a rejection of free will.

Thought: 
  Both passages address the implications of neuroscience on the concept of free will and punishment. 
  Passage A suggests that the criminal justice system should focus on deterrence rather than retribution in light of neuroscience findings about how the brain influences behavior. 
  Passage B describes a theory of "soft determinism" that argues that actions can still be free even in a deterministic world. 
  Both passages suggest that scientific research into the brain has implications for how we think about free will and punishment. 
  Therefore, the question both passages are concerned with answering is B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
Criticism: 
  There is no clear evidence that both passages are focused on answering a single question.

Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that people's behavior is solely determined by the operations of the brain and that this calls into question the idea that bad people should be punished for their actions. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and how it can coexist with determinism, arguing that actions are free as long as they are not constrained by external sources.
Thought: 
  Both passages discuss the implications of neuroscience for our understanding of human behavior and the law. 
  Passage A argues that because our brains determine our behavior, the law should focus on deterring future harms instead of punishing people for their freely-chosen immoral acts.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

Criticism:
  There is no significant flaw in the logic or reasoning. The answer accurately and completely reflects the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoevsky's position on literary criticism in Russia during his time.
  The radical critics had two main positions: (1) art must have a concrete basis in reality and expose want and injustice to create a new society, and (2) art must serve a particular political view.
  Dostoevsky took a third position that saw reality as more than just the tangible and insisted that artistic merit was more important than usefulness.
Thought:
  Dostoevsky rejected the radical critics' claims that literature must have concrete basis in reality and must be useful to society.
  He believed in the ability of literature to explode boundaries between reality and fantasy, and to make the reader see reality in a new way.
  Additionally, he believed that artistic merit was essential to literature and that the usefulness of literature could not be determined beforehand.
  The question asks how Dostoevsky's attitude might be softened if the radical critics changed their views.
  Answer choice A suggests that if the radical critics separated reality and fantasy more clearly, this might change Dostoevsky's attitude.
  Answer choice B suggests that if the critics prioritized clarity of purpose over formal aspects of a literary work, Dostoevsky might be more accepting of their views.
  Answer choice C suggests that if the critics acknowledged the importance of eliminating certain realistic elements from literature, Dostoevsky might be more accepting of their views.
  Answer choice D suggests that if the critics recognized the importance of artistic merit, Dostoevsky might be more accepting of their views.
  Answer choice E suggests that if the critics explained their demand for depicting reality more fully, Dostoevsky might be more accepting of their views.
  Based on his rejection of the critics' claims for usefulness and concrete reality in literature, it is likely that Dostoevsky would be more accepting of their views if they recognized the full significance of artistic merit.
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Criticism:
  None.

Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical view that literature should have a specific political purpose and be rooted in concrete reality to contribute to the creation of a new society.
  He believed that reality and fantasy were intimately linked, which suggests he would be unlikely to draw a sharper distinction between them.
  He valued the formal aspects of a literary work over its clarity of purpose when evaluating it, so he would likely not be swayed if the radical critics also put clarity of purpose first.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," so if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, it would be most similar to Dostoyevsky's view.
  Acknowledging the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality and explaining their demand that reality be depicted as it is would do little to change Dostoyevsky's view.
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.
  B: Katherine Dunham's ballets were distinct from others produced in North America in that they incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures.
  C: Katherine Dunham's expertise as an anthropologist allowed her to use Caribbean and African dance traditions to express the aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers.
  D: The innovative research methods of Katherine Dunham made possible her discovery that the dance traditions of the Caribbean were derived from earlier African dance traditions.
  E: Katherine Dunham's anthropological and choreographic expertise enabled her to make contributions that altered the landscape of modern dance in North America.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music, particularly the jazz genre.
  Lines 11-16 describe the way the narration in Jazz is structured to resemble the ensemble sound and individuality of jazz music. 
  A: This statement aligns with the author's assertion.
  B: The passage doesn't mention any African American novelists basing their work on the structure of blues music.
  C: The passage doesn't make a broad assertion about novels dealing with the arts.
  D: The passage doesn't make a broad assertion about novels being musical in nature; it specifically discusses the unique structure of Jazz.
  E: The passage doesn't compare African American and non-African American writers who have written about music.
Thought: 
  The author is discussing the structure of Jazz, which is designed to resemble the structure of jazz music.
  The author is making a claim about the relationship between form (narrative structure) and content (jazz music) in the novel.
  None of the other answer choices deal with this specific assertion or the relationship between narrative structure and jazz music.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is None of the Above.
Criticism: 
  None of the other answer choices accurately capture the author's assertion about the structure of Jazz and its relationship to jazz music.
  However, it is possible that answer choice A is the closest: if the author had intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance, that would align with the author's assertion that the narration structure resembles the structure of jazz music.
  Therefore, the best answer would be Answer("A") with the caveat that it is not a perfect match for the author's assertion. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's 1992 novel "Jazz" and how the narrative structure reflects the style of jazz music with its individual solos within a collective narration.
Thought:
  The author asserts that none of the African American writers had used a musical genre as the structuring principle for a novel before Toni Morrison did so in "Jazz".
  This assertion would be most called into question if B were true, that a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
  However, the passage does not mention anything about African American novelists basing the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music. The passage mentions only the use of musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing.
  Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the author's assertion that Toni Morrison's "Jazz" was the first novel to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle is incorrect.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music, particularly jazz.
  The author describes how Morrison uses the structure and style of a jazz performance in the narration of the novel.
  A: This statement accurately reflects the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
  B: The passage does not mention any African American novelists who based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
  C: The passage does not make a general statement about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists.
  D: The passage does not make a general statement about novels in general being musical in nature.
  E: The passage does not make any comparison between the number of African American writers and non-African American writers who have written novels about music.
Thought:
  The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is about the structure of Jazz and how it is similar to the structure of a jazz performance.
  The author argues that Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  This assertion is not about all novels or all nonliterary arts and artists, so choices C and D are irrelevant.
  The passage does not mention any other African American novelists who used music as a structuring principle, so choice B is also irrelevant.
  The passage does not make any comparisons between African American and non-African American writers who wrote about music, so choice E is also irrelevant.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct, and your reasoning is sound. 
  The evidence from the passage supports your selection.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is discussing Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and draws parallels between the novel's structure and the structure of jazz music.
  The passage contrasts the narrator's disembodied voice with the individual lyricism of the key characters.
Thought: 
  The passage asserts that the narration and structure of Jazz is analogous to the playing of a jazz hand, in which there is an ensemble sound combined with individual solos. 
  In this analogy, the narrator's voice is like the ensemble sound, while the sections of key characters are like individual solos.
  The author suggests that Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a collective narration.
  The author argues that Morrison is able to simulate the style of a genius of music while exhibiting her own linguistic virtuosity.
  None of the answer choices seem to accurately summarize the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
Criticism: 
  None of the answer choices provide a statement that accurately reflects the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  In the passage, the author discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and compares its narrative structure to the composition of a jazz performance.
  The author emphasizes the unique quality of Jazz that it is the first novel to use the structuring principle of a musical genre.
Thought:
  The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if one of the following were true.
  A: If even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story, then this strengthens the argument that Morrison based her structure on jazz. 
  B: If a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, this has no bearing on the assertion that Morrison was the first novelist to use a musical genre as a structuring principle for an entire novel.
  C: If all novels about non-literary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question, this does not necessarily impact the assertion that Jazz was the first to use a musical genre as a structuring principle for an entire novel.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found somewhat musical in nature; however, this does not contradict the assertion that Jazz was the first novel to use a musical genre as a structuring principle for an entire novel.
  E: The number of African American writers who have written novels with music as a theme or character does not address the issue of whether any of them have used a musical genre as a structuring principle for an entire novel.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to the thought process.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is discussing Toni Morrison's novel Jazz.
  The narrative structure of Jazz is compared to the playing of a jazz hand, where individual solos are embedded in an ensemble sound created by the composer/conductor.
Thought:
  Lines 11-16 are discussing the way in which the narration of Jazz is similar to the playing of a jazz hand.
  The author is arguing that Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, similar to how a jazz ensemble performs.
  The author is not asserting that Jazz is the only novel where the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of performance in the narration of the story, or that all novels that feature non-literary arts have a narrative style reminiscent of the arts in question.
  The focus is on the specific comparison between Jazz and jazz music.
  Therefore, B, C, D, and E can be eliminated.
  The correct answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Criticism: 
  This is a plausible interpretation of the passage, but it is not explicitly stated that a "casual reading" of Jazz would make it evident that the author intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  This answer choice seems to be overstating the author's position.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, which uses a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
  The writing in Jazz draws upon the structure and improvisation of jazz music.
Thought: 
  The author asserts that Toni Morrison created a narrative structure in Jazz that is analogous to the structure and improvisation of jazz music.
  The narration slips from third-person omniscience to first-person lyricism, similar to a jazz ensemble.
  Key characters relate their parts of the overarching story and their sections are set off by quotation marks.
  The narrator is both generous with characters' voices and protective of narrative mastery.
  These narrative elements create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  If A were true and Jazz were intentionally constructed to simulate a style of jazz performance, it would support the author's assertion of the novel's structure and improvisation.
  If B, C, D, or E were true, they would not directly support or challenge the author's assertion.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its structure, which simulates the structure of a jazz performance.
  A: The author of the passage does assert that Morrison has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: The passage does not mention that a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
  C: The author of the passage does not make any generalizations about all novels about non-literary arts and artists.
  D: The passage does not support the idea that any novel can be found to be musical in nature, depending on whether or not it is read aloud.
  E: The passage doesn't offer a comparison between African American writers and non-African American writers in North America in relation to writing novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Thought:
  The question asks what assertion the author would be most called in question if a certain statement were true.
  The only statement that directly relates to the author's assertion about Jazz's structure is A, which is already supported by the passage.
  None of the other answer choices directly relate to the author's assertion.
  Therefore, the answer must be A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
The passage is discussing how the structure of Toni Morrison's novel Jazz is similar to the structure of a jazz composition. 
The author argues that Morrison has created a novel that evokes the feeling of a group of characters improvising within the framework of a structured composition, in a manner similar to jazz music.  
The passage compares Morrison's use of quotation marks in the narration of the novel to the inevitable constraints placed on jazz musicians who are playing in an ensemble. 
The passage does not discuss any earlier African American novelists that used music as inspiration for the form of their work, nor does it address novels about nonliterary arts or whether or not all novels can be found to be "somewhat musical in nature".
Thought: 
The author is discussing the characteristics of Jazz and how Toni Morrison has structured the story in a way that is similar to the structure of a jazz composition. 
The author is arguing that Morrison's use of quotation marks creates a sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, because the forms of literature and music aspire to a similar treatment of form as content. 
Therefore, the only answer choice that is directly related to this argument is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz as an example of a novel that uses the structure of a musical genre as the structuring principle for a novel.
  Morrison's narration of Jazz slips between a third-person omniscient voice and the first-person lyricism of key characters, akin to the structure of a jazz performance.
Thought: 
  The author discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz as an example of a novel with a unique structure that mirrors the music genre of jazz, slipping between third-person and first-person narration that echoes a jazz performance.
  The author goes on to describe how the novel simulates an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a collective narration, much like the way jazz musicians perform solo "with quotation marks around their improvisations and solos."
  The author then says that Jazz redefines the very possibilities of a narrative point of view.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would most likely depend on the idea of a novel's structure simulating a musical genre, specifically jazz, in order to create a unique narrative structure.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.

Answer: B
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage offers two conflicting positions regarding deterrence of deliberate crimes and then introduces a principle of utility maximization to reconcile the debate and show that both sides actually have the same effect. Therefore, the best answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage describes two sides of a debate, one advocating for changing societal norms and institutions to reduce deliberate crimes, and the other advocating for stronger penalties and law enforcement to deter deliberate crimes. It then introduces the economic principle of utility maximization, which shows that these two positions are actually complementary, as they both affect the expected utility of committing a crime. This principle is then used to analyze the rational economic choice of committing a crime, and to demonstrate that both types of deterrence strategies are effective. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the function of the third paragraph within the passage as a whole?
Choices:
  A: to refute traditional interpretations of certain artifacts
  B: to present evidence that undermines a theory
  C: to provide examples that support an argument
  D: to contrast several different modes of expression
  E: to enumerate specific instances in which a phenomenon recurred
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how the study of Native American autobiographies is limited to written documents produced as a result of "bicultural composite authorship."
  Scholars have not studied traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history used by Native Americans, or addressed cultural constructs of Native American peoples prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures.
Thought:
  The third paragraph presents examples of traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history used by Native Americans. 
  Examples include: songs, chants, stories, the process of taking on new names, dance, drama, and tattoos.
  The paragraph suggests that such traditional modes of communication have been overlooked by scholars of Native American autobiographies.
  Therefore, the function of the third paragraph is to provide examples that support an argument.
  The answer is C: to provide examples that support an argument.
Criticism:
  There is no refutation of traditional interpretations of any artifact.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The third paragraph discusses traditional preliterate modes of communicating personal history in Native American cultures.
Thought:
  The third paragraph provides examples of traditional preliterate modes of autobiographical expression, such as songs, chants, decorated shields, pictographic robes, and symbolic tepees, which communicate the accomplishments and aspirations of the storyteller. The paragraph also contrasts the traditional Native American modes of autobiographical expression, which emphasize collective narratives, language, and performative experiences, with the European concept of autobiography, which emphasizes individuality, writing, and the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, the paragraph emphasizes that oral autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them, thus highlighting the diverse and complex ways in which autobiographical expression and interpretation are socially and culturally constructed.
Therefore, the answer is C: to provide examples that support an argument. 
Criticism: None.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The passage describes the various modes of communicating personal history among Native Americans, both before and after contact with nonindigenous cultures. It explains that scholars who have studied Native American autobiographies have often overlooked the traditional, preliterate modes of expression, which tended to be oriented toward current events and which involved oral recitation, art, and other forms of expression that were interwoven with the community. 

Thought: 
The third paragraph of the passage presents several examples of traditional modes of expression among Native Americans that were used to communicate personal history. These examples are presented to underscore the point that Native American cultures had different assumptions about the concept of autobiography than did Europeans, and had a more inclusive sense of self and identity. The paragraph thus provides specific instances to support the broader argument that the idea of autobiography should be revisited in the context of Native American cultures.

Answer: C: to provide examples that support an argument

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of the planet Neptune using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the solar system's bodies.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides incorrectly predicted the number of high tides on Earth.
  B: Edwin Hubble discovered Andromeda is a galaxy, settling a debate about the extent of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez found iridium and concluded an asteroid caused dinosaur extinction. Later evidence supported his theory.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered magnetized rocks indicating past reversals in Earth's magnetic field.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated an undetected particle to account for apparent violation of the law of conservation of energy in neutron decay.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of a planet through changes to auxiliary assumptions. This situation is most analogous to Walter Alvarez's theory that dinosaur extinction was caused by an asteroid impact. The main explanation consisted of an interpretation of data. Specifically, Alvarez noted that a rock core sample showed high concentrations of iridium, a metal rare on Earth but common in asteroids. Subsequently, a large impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula was discovered, dated to the era of dinosaur extinction. Alvarez's theory suggests that adjusting auxiliary assumptions--such as the assumption that Earth existed in a steady state without catastrophic events--can lead to significant advances in scientific understanding.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of an impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes how, after failing to accurately predict the orbit of Uranus, astronomers hypothesized the existence of a new planet, which they called Neptune. When Uranus was observed again and Neptune was taken into account, calculations were in alignment with observations.
  A: This episode is about ocean tides, not planetary orbits.
  B: This episode is about discovering that Andromeda is a galaxy, not planetary orbits.
  C: This episode is about the extinction of the dinosaurs, not planetary orbits.
  D: This episode is about the reversal of Earth's magnetic field in the past, not planetary orbits.
  E: This episode is about the decay of a neutron and the postulation of an undetected particle, not planetary orbits.
Thought: 
  The question asks which episode is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  The discovery of Neptune was based on the hypothesis that a new planet existed to explain observations of Uranus.
  The discovery of a new planet was able to better align calculations based on Newton's laws with observations.
  Thus, the episode most analogous to the discovery of Neptune would be one where scientists hypothesized the existence of an unobserved entity to explain observations that were not aligned with current theories at the time.
  Option C does involve scientists making a hypothesis (an asteroid impact) to explain observations (high levels of iridium) that were not in line with current theories at the time. Later evidence supported the hypothesis and explained the observations.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction. 
Criticism: 
  The asteroid impact hypothesis did not involve the discovery of an "unobserved entity", but rather an explanation for iridium levels in rock core samples.
  However, it does provide an example of scientists making a hypothesis to explain observations that were not in line with current theories.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune by astronomers attempting to predict its orbit using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  A: Galileo's theory on tides is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  B: Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy is also not analogous.
  C: Alvarez's postulation of an asteroid impact and the discovery of high levels of the mineral iridium is not analogous.
  D: Brunhes's discovery of magnetized rocks that were oppositely oriented to Earth's magnetic field, while interesting and important in geology, is not analogous.
  E: Pauli's postulation of an undetected particle created during a neutron's decay is not analogous.
Thought:
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Neptune using predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The discovery of Uranus presents an incorrect prediction that is later corrected with the discovery of Neptune.
  Similarly, this suggests that the discovery of another unknown planet will also fit the prediction in question.
  Therefore, searching for the unknown planet that will fit the prediction is analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  So, the answer is E: searching for an undetected particle to fit the prediction of energy conservation in the decay of a neutron is analogous to the discovery of Neptune in Passage B.
Criticism:
  While the search for an unknown planet to fit the prediction of Neptune's orbit is included, it is not the central point of the analogy in Passage B.
  Instead, the central point is that the incorrect prediction is later corrected with the discovery of a previously unknown entity that fits the prediction.
  The search for the particle in E is also similar in that a postulation is made to explain an apparent contradiction, and then a search for the unknown entity leads to its discovery.
  However, it could be argued that C is also an acceptable answer in that it describes a postulation being made (an asteroid impact causing a dinosaur extinction) and later evidence being found that supports the postulation (a large impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula). 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes the discovery of a planet, Neptune, that was hypothesized to exist based on calculations made using Newton's laws and other auxiliary assumptions.
  A: Galileo's theory about tides is not related to the discovery of a new planet and does not involve recalibrating previous theories or assumptions.
  B: Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy was a completely new discovery that did not involve recalibrating previous theories or assumptions.
  C: Walter Alvarez's postulation about an asteroid causing the extinction of the dinosaurs  was based on observations of high levels of iridium and later corroborated by the discovery of an impact crater. This discovery did not involve recalibrating previous theories or assumptions.
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery of reversed magnetism in rocks does not involve recalibrating previous theories or assumptions and also does not involve the discovery of a new planet.
  E: Pauli's postulation about a neutrino is related to recalibrating a previous theory and making a new discovery, but it does not involve observations of a larger system with auxiliary assumptions.
Thought:
  Passage B describes astronomers making observations that contradict their predicted orbit for Uranus, which leads them to hypothesize the existence of another planet.
  The astronomers then adjust their assumptions about the location of other planets and predict the orbit of a new planet.
  They later discover a planet, Neptune, in the predicted location.
  The discovery of Neptune involves recalibrating previous theories and assumptions to account for the observed discrepancies in order to make a new discovery.
  None of the other episodes involves the discovery of a new planet or recalibrating previous theories and assumptions to make a new discovery.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, or D.
  The most analogous episode to the discovery of Neptune is E, where Pauli hypothesized a new particle to explain discrepancies between observation and theory and later the existence of that particle was discovered.
  Both involve recalibrating previous assumptions in the light of new observations to make new discoveries.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Criticism: 
  This is a reasonable answer based on the reasoning process. 
  However, it should be noted that the analogy is not a perfect match, as Neptune was hypothesized based on the observed orbit of another planet, while Pauli's neutrino postulation was based on observations of radioactive decay.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes astronomers predicting the existence and orbit of a planet, and then later discovering that planet as predicted.
  A: This choice describes a theory that was proposed and then found to be incorrect because it made a false prediction.
  B: This choice describes an observation that led to the discovery of a new galaxy, not the prediction and discovery of a planet.
  C: This choice describes an observation that led to a postulation of a cause, which was later confirmed by the discovery of additional evidence.
  D: This choice describes a discovery that Earth's magnetic field must have reversed at some point in the past.
  E: This choice describes the discovery of a third particle that explains apparent discrepancies in energy conservation during the decay of a neutron.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes the prediction and discovery of a planet using calculations based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers predicted a planet's existence and orbit, and then discovered that planet as predicted.
  This is analogous to making a prediction and then discovering evidence that confirms the prediction.
  Therefore, the most analogous scientific episode is the discovery of Neptune as described in passage B.
  The answer is B.
Criticism: 
  The most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune as described in passage B is actually not provided among the choices.
  Choice B describes a different type of scientific discovery than that described in passage B.
  Although Choice A, Choice C, Choice D, and Choice E describe scientific discoveries, they each describe a different type of discovery than that described in passage B.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of the planet Neptune.
  When Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit.
  They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the predicted orbit was incorrect.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets and hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they called Neptune.
Thought:
  Passage B explains how the discovery of the planet Neptune occurred through the scientific method.
  Astronomers made predictions on Uranus's orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  They later found out the predicted orbit was incorrect.
  It was hypothesized that another planet could explain the derogation, and later Neptune was discovered in the same place predicted.
  The situation that best describes this scenario in the given options is B: Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is a galaxy in its own right by observing "variable stars" on Andromeda.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The question is asking which episode is the most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as described in Passage B. In that episode, astronomers predicted the existence of a planet based on their observations of Uranus' orbit, and later Neptune was discovered in the predicted location.
 
A: This episode involves an incorrect prediction about the number of high tides, which is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
 
B: This episode involves the discovery of a galaxy and the settling of a debate about the structure of the universe, which is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
 
C: This episode involves the discovery of evidence supporting a hypothesis about the extinction of the dinosaurs, which is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
 
D: This episode involves the discovery of rocks with a reversed magnetic field, which is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
 
E: This episode involves the postulation and later discovery of an undetected particle, which is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
 
Thought: 
The discovery of Neptune was based on the prediction of its existence using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun, other planets, and their velocities.
 
Criticisms: 
None.
 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary premises, but their predictions were incorrect, and they hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity to explain their observations.
Thought: 
  Passage B is asking us to identify another scientific episode that is analogous to the discovery of Neptune. 
  In the discovery of Neptune, astronomers predicted the presence of another planet based on their observations and changed their previous auxiliary assumption accordingly, resulting in the discovery of Neptune.
  Looking at the answer choices: 
    A is about Galileo's theory of tides, which falsely predicted the number of tides per day.
    B is about Edwin Hubble discovering that Andromeda is a galaxy in its own right, settling the debate about the size of the universe.
    C is about Walter Alvarez's explanation of the extinction of dinosaurs based on iridium levels and subsequent discovery of a large impact crater.
    D is about Bernard Brunhes discovering magnetized rocks indicating the reversal of the Earth's magnetic field in the past.
    E is about Wolfgang Pauli postulating the existence of a third particle involved in neutron decay, which was later confirmed.
  Based on the analogous criteria identified earlier, (1) scientists make predictions based on certain premises, (2) predictions fail, (3) scientists generate new premises to explain their observations, which lead to new discoveries.
  Option C is the closest to this description because Walter Alvarez predicted the extinction of the dinosaurs based on the discovery of iridium in rock core samples. Subsequent evidence of a large impact crater led to the hypothesis of an asteroid impact causing the extinction, which serves as new premises. Thus, they are analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions but found that their predictions were incorrect, leading them to hypothesize the existence of another planet in its vicinity, which they later discovered and named Neptune.
Thought:
  The astronomers discovered Neptune when they hypothesized its existence based on discrepancies in their predictions of Uranus's orbit. 
  This is similar to how Walter Alvarez discovered an asteroid impact caused the extinction of dinosaurs through his observations of iridium levels in rock core samples and later evidence of a large impact crater.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.
Criticism: 
  The astronomers' discovery of Neptune through hypotheses of its existence based on discrepancies in their predictions of Uranus's orbit is not analogous to Walter Alvarez's discovery that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. 
  The Alvarez discovery was made by observing high iridium levels in rock core samples and later discovering evidence of a large impact crater.
  Thus, option C is not the correct answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The question asks for the scientific episode most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as described in Passage B.
  Passage B describes how astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus, but the prediction was incorrect.
  One possible explanation was that the auxiliary assumptions were wrong, and the astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they later discovered was Neptune.
Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, but the prediction was incorrect.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the predictions failed, the astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they later discovered was Neptune.
  Therefore, the scientific episode most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is one in which scientists make a prediction based on certain assumptions, but the prediction is incorrect, and the scientists hypothesize the existence of something new to explain the discrepancy.
  The episode described in choice C is about hypothesizing an explanation for high levels of iridium in rock core samples, and later discovering evidence of a large impact crater that supports the hypothesis. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  The episodes described in choices A, B, D, and E do not involve the discovery of something new to explain a failed prediction.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, D, or E.
  The only choice left is C, which is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
Criticism:
  The reasoning is incorrect. 
  While it is true that Passage B describes how astronomers predict the orbit of Uranus based on certain assumptions, but the prediction was incorrect.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the predictions failed, the astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they later discovered was Neptune.
  However, the episodes described in the choices A, B, D, and E do all involve the discovery of something new to explain a failed prediction, just like the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, the only choice left is C, and that is the correct answer.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk and how it influences lay and expert judgments about risk. 
  It argues that judgments about voluntariness are often based on selective attention and confusion, and that they are of little use in guiding policy decisions.
Thought: 
  The author emphasizes that judgments about voluntariness are often flawed and should not be the sole determinant of government intervention in matters of risk. Instead, the government should prioritize saving as many lives as possible, subject to the limitations of public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. 
  Based on this, the author would be most likely to agree with statement D, which suggests that a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. This aligns with the author's argument that the voluntariness of a risk is largely a matter of degree and can be ambiguous, but that the focus should be on identifying the specific factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness rather than taking the concept as a proxy for broader policy decisions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the difficulties with characterizing risks as "voluntary" or "involuntary."
  The distinction between the two types of risks is largely based on whether the risk is incurred voluntarily.
Thought: 
  The passage argues that the distinction between "voluntary" and "involuntary" risks is not based on any special magic.
  Instead, regulatory policy should focus on saving as many lives as possible, subject to limited resources.
  The passage implies that policies should not be based on whether a risk is incurred voluntarily or involuntarily.
  Therefore, the author is least likely to agree with the statement that people should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose (A). 
  The author argues that characterizing risks as voluntary or involuntary is not straightforward.
  Therefore, the statement that for public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice (D) is not the best answer.
  The passage mentions that risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought of as involuntary, but people may choose airlines based on safety records or choose not to fly.
  However, it does not imply that the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety (B).
  The passage does not mention the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury for different types of risks.
  Therefore, the statement that both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers (C) is not the best answer.
  Finally, the passage argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not very useful for guiding policy decisions.
  Therefore, it is least likely that the author would agree with the statement that the main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster (E).
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the idea that laypeople and policy experts may have different ideas about what risks should be protected against and who is responsible for that protection.
  The author suggests that classifying risks as "voluntary" or "involuntary" is not very useful for making policy decisions.
Thought: 
  The author argues against the idea of classifying risks as "voluntary" or "involuntary" for regulatory policy and suggests that resources should be devoted to risk reduction based on a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  Furthermore, the author argues that people tend to call a risk voluntary if they don't approve of the activity being performed.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with the statement that people should not be protected against the risks incurred through dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose.
  So, the answer is A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state that the government should not protect people against risks incurred through dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose.
  While the author does suggest that notions of voluntariness are not helpful for making policy decisions, it does not necessarily follow that people should not be protected against such activities. 
  Therefore, there could be other interpretations of the author's position.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is often based on confusion and selective attention.
  There is often overlap between voluntary and involuntary risk.
  People tend to care whether a risk is voluntary.
  Government should save as many lives as possible while taking into account limited resources.
Thought:
  The author argues against relying on the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks and suggests that government should prioritize saving lives.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with statement D since it reflects the author's argument that risks should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people choose to subject themselves to it.
  A is incorrect since the author does not suggest that people should not be protected against risks.
  B is incorrect since the passage argues that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake and that they should prioritize saving lives.
  C is not supported by the passage.
  E is a specific statement relating to a different category of risk and is not supported by the passage either.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks in the context of public policy decisions. 
A: The passage does not state that people should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities such as skydiving, nor does it discuss the social usefulness of skydiving. 
B: The passage suggests that policy experts focus on aggregate lives at stake, while laypeople often care about whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. 
C: The passage does not provide any information to support this statement or make any comparison between plane crashes and other risks incurred by airline passengers. 
D: The passage discusses the difficulty in determining whether a risk is voluntarily or involuntarily incurred, and suggests that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary is not straightforward or useful in guiding policy decisions. 
E: The passage briefly mentions unforeseeable collisions with asteroids as a type of risk that may be incurred involuntarily, but does not make any statement about natural disasters as a category of risk. 
Thought: 
The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not a useful guide for public policy decisions, and that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can subject to resource constraints. 
Of the choices, option D seems most closely related to this argument, as it also addresses the issue of defining voluntary and involuntary risks. 
Option A is not discussed in the passage, and options B, C, and E are either not related to the main argument or not supported by the information provided.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The author believes that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion, selective attention, and antecedent judgments. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. 
  The author argues that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. 
Thought:
  The author believes that judgments about whether a risk is "voluntary" or "involuntary" are of little utility in guiding policy decisions.
  Regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with the statement that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Thus, the answer is not explicitly stated in the passage but can be inferred from the author's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the different ways people perceive "voluntary" and "involuntary" risks. 
  The author suggests that focusing on voluntariness is often unhelpful in guiding policy decisions. 
Thought:
  The author argues that the notion of voluntariness is often used as a proxy for other factors and is not a useful guide for policy decisions. 
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would disagree with the statement in A that people should generally not be protected against risks incurred through dangerous and socially useless activities, as this suggests that the government should not intervene in dangerous activities regardless of the risks to individuals.
  The author also suggests that policy experts focus on aggregate lives at stake rather than whether individuals chose to take risks (B is incorrect).
  The passage doesn't make any explicit comparison between plane crashes and other risks incurred by airline passengers (C is incorrect). 
  The author suggests that risks can be voluntary or involuntary to different degrees and that the categorization often reflects selective attention and judgments about the purpose of risking the activity (D is incorrect).
  The passage doesn't make any explicit mention of natural disasters and whether they are incurred involuntarily (E is incorrect).
  Therefore, the best answer is A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose. (since the author argues that the notion of voluntariness is not useful in guiding policy decisions, they would not necessarily think that people should (or should not) be protected from particular activities on the basis of voluntariness). 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the "voluntary/involuntary" distinction in risk judgments is often flawed and based on selective attention or approval of the purpose for incurring the risk. Additionally, they argue that regulatory policy should be guided by saving as many lives as possible, subject to limited resources. There is no indication that the author believes that people should generally not be protected from dangerous activities or that the probability of occurrence and probability of death or injury for plane crashes are higher than any other risk incurred by airline passengers. Finally, the author does not make any statements about the risks of natural disasters.
Thought: 
  The author emphasizes that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not useful in guiding policy decisions. They argue that policy decisions should be made based on saving as many lives as possible, subject to limited resources. Therefore, the author would likely agree with a statement that emphasizes the importance of saving lives, regardless of whether a risk is deemed voluntary or involuntary.
  The most likely statement that aligns with the author's argument is that the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety. This statement supports the author's argument that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not crucial in guiding policy decisions if the main goal is to save lives.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the difference between voluntary and involuntary risks in the context of government intervention to protect people from risk.
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is often not clear-cut and that regulatory policy should be guided by other factors.
  A: The passage does not take a clear stance on whether people should be protected against dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The passage suggests that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, but that laypeople care a great deal about whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. 
    The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention.
  C: The passage does not provide any information supporting the claim that plane crashes are a higher risk for airline passengers than any other kind of risk.
  D: The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is often not clear-cut and that it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. 
    Therefore, the author would not be likely to agree with the statement in choice D.
  E: The passage does not support the claim that natural disasters are the main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily.
Thought: 
  The author argues against making regulatory policy decisions based solely on the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks and calls for a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that advocates for regulatory policy that is not guided by notions of voluntariness.
  Choice A is not supported by the passage.
  Choice B is not a clear statement about regulatory policy and is not a stance that the author would necessarily agree with.
  Choice C is not supported by the passage and is not relevant to the author's argument.
  Choice D is not consistent with the author's argument against categorizing risks as either voluntary or involuntary.
  Choice E is not supported by the passage.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the concept of "voluntary" and "involuntary" risks, and that this distinction can be confused and used selectively.
Thought:
  The author argues that regulatory policy should be guided by saving as many lives as possible, subject to the available resources.
  Departures from this principle should be justified by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
  The author believes that it's not relevant whether the risks are incurred voluntarily or involuntarily, and determining voluntariness can be confusing and selective.
  The author did not express any opinions on specific types of activities or risks, only a general principle.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with choice D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. 
Criticism:
  None.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: According to the passage, why do university researchers increasingly believe that patents should be granted for commercially promising biotechnology discoveries?
Choices:
  A: Researchers' prospects for academic advancement depend on both the quality and the quantity of their research.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

  The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
  Molina and Rowland advocated for a prompt and proportionate public policy response to the depletion of the ozone layer. 
Thought:
  The passage mentions that CFCs are the primary cause of ozone depletion, not other chemicals.
  The passage does not explicitly state that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  The passage mentions that ultraviolet light contributes to skin cancer, but it does not state that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  Molina and Rowland advocated for policy changes to reduce the depletion of the ozone layer, which could indirectly lower incidence of skin cancer if successful.
  The passage does not mention that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
  Therefore, the best answer choice is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Criticism: 
  There is no direct mention of a causal relationship between the reduction in CFCs and the lowering of skin cancer incidents.
  However, the fact that CFCs contribute to ozone depletion and that ozone depletion leads to an increase in ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface, reinforces that regulating the use of CFCs is important for reducing the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland showed that the use of CFCs leads to the destruction of the ozone layer.
  CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer by releasing chlorine in the stratosphere, which reacts with ozone to regenerate chlorine atoms, leading to ozone depletion.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is a pressing environmental threat that increases the risk of skin cancer due to excessive absorption of ultraviolet radiation by the skin.
Thought: 
  The passage provides strong evidence for the link between the depletion of the ozone layer due to the use of CFCs and the increased risk of skin cancer due to excessive absorption of ultraviolet radiation by the skin.

Thought:
  The passage focuses on the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer and their contribution to the depletion of the ozone layer.
  While the passage does mention the chemical reaction between chlorine and ozone that causes the depletion of the ozone layer, it does not suggest that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  Although the passage mentions skin cancer and its connection to the depletion of the ozone layer, it does not suggest that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  The passage does not suggest that few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.

  CFCs, originally used extensively in aerosol sprays and refrigerants, chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Over time the advocacy of Molina and Rowland contributed to the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which banned the production of ozone-depleting gases, including CFCs.
  Regulating the use of CFCs contributes directly to protection of the ozone layer and indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer as CFCs deplete the ozone layer that acts as a shield against ultraviolet rays.
  Therefore, a most strongly supported statement is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide any information to support statement A that "little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present."
  B is incorrect because excessive absorption of ultraviolet light from the sun results in skin cancer, but the incidence of skin cancer is not the topic of the passage.
  C is not supported because the passage does not elaborate on any other chemicals that can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere, besides CFCs.
  E is false because the passage does not say that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

  Chlorine atoms react with ozone to destroy it and regenerate the chlorine atoms.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to CFCs, and how this affects the screening out of ultraviolet radiation, which could lead to skin cancer.
  Option A is not strongly supported because the passage mentions "natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium". 
  Option B is not strongly supported because the passage only mentions one cause of skin cancer, which is excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  Option C is not strongly supported because the passage only discusses CFCs as a chemical that releases chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  Option D seems to be the most strongly supported because the passage discusses how the depletion of the ozone layer affects the screening out of ultraviolet radiation, which can cause skin cancer. Regulating the use of CFCs, which deplete the ozone layer, can therefore contribute indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  Option E is not strongly supported because the passage only mentions the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica and not the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere mainly in Antarctica.
Criticism:
  Option D could be challenged because the passage does not directly state that regulating the use of CFCs contributes to lowering the incidence of skin cancer. It only explains the relationship between the depletion of the ozone layer and the screening out of ultraviolet radiation, which in turn can lead to skin cancer.

  It states that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The passage also notes that the depletion of the ozone layer from CFCs would continue for years, if not decades, even if production and use were to cease immediately.
Thought:
  The passage provides information that skin cancer is caused by excessive absorption of ultraviolet light, and that much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by the ozone layer in the stratosphere.
  It also explains how CFCs contribute to the loss of the protective ozone layer, leading to greater ultraviolet radiation exposure, which can increase the incidence of skin cancer.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs can indirectly contribute to the prevention of skin cancer by preserving the ozone layer.
  The passage does not support option A, which suggests that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present. The passage does not discuss other natural causes of ozone destruction.
  The passage does not support option C as it only mentions CFCs as a chemical that results in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  The passage does not support option E. Although it mentions the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, it does not suggest that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in that region.

- A layer of ozone in the stratosphere screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
- Manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
- Chlorine released by the breakdown of CFCs in the stratosphere chemically reacts with and destroys ozone, and ozone-depleting gases should be banned to save the ozone layer.

Thought:
- The passage describes how CFCs cause ozone depletion in the stratosphere by releasing chlorine, which react with and destroy ozone.
- The passage does not suggest that "little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present" (A).
- The passage mentions that "ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer" (B), but it does not suggest that it occurs primarily due to excessive absorption of this type of light.
- The passage mentions that CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere, but it does not suggest that few other chemicals can have similar effects. Therefore, (C) is not the most strongly supported statement.
- The passage does not describe a direct relationship between regulating the use of CFCs and lowering the incidence of skin cancer. However, the passage does describe how regulating CFCs contributes to reducing ozone depletion, which in turn contributes to reducing ultraviolet radiation that could lead to skin cancer. Therefore, the statement "Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer" (D) is most strongly supported.
- The passage does not suggest that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica. Therefore, (E) is not the most strongly supported statement.

Criticism:
- None.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The primary function of the third paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: reject a possible response to the argument made in the first paragraph
  B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph
  C: present an argument that weakens the argument made in the second paragraph
  D: offer additional evidence for the conclusion reach,ed in the second paragraph
  E: draw a definitive conclusion from the claims made in the second paragraph
Response 0:
Knowledge: The third paragraph addresses the two social classes who could commission art according to the first paragraph- the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, also known as the bourgeoisie. The author talks about how the middle class and aristocracy may not have always produced art that endures and how artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment.
Thought: 
  The third paragraph neither rejects a response to the argument made in the first paragraph nor presents an argument that weakens the argument made in the second paragraph. 
  It does identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
  It argues that the taste of the aristocracy and upper-middle class may not have been apt to produce art that endures, and how more talented artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment.
  Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
  The answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Criticism: 
  You are correct. The third paragraph identifies assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. Specifically, the paragraph notes that for a sociohistorical analysis of art to be effective, it must assume that the elite have a recognizable identity and consensus about the world, as well as eliminating the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Therefore, the correct answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The third paragraph follows a discussion of the two different ways that art was "produced by and for political and social elites", and how sociohistorical critics like Taruskin analyze the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite. The paragraph discusses the historical context in which art was commissioned, noting that historically the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic or governing class and the well-to-do middle class. The paragraph highlights the flaws in the taste of these two classes and how it may not always produce art that endures. The more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment, and a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. 
Thought: 
  The third paragraph seems to expand on the discussion of the second paragraph about the "two different ways" art was produced for the social and political elites. In particular, the third paragraph elaborates on the limitations of the two social classes that commissioned art and their tastes. The paragraph did not reject a possible response to the argument made in the first paragraph. It also did not present an argument that weakens or offers additional evidence for the conclusion reached in the second paragraph. Instead, it identified assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Therefore, I think the correct answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to:
Knowledge: The third paragraph presents opinions and judgments regarding art produced by social elites. The opinion is that not all art produced by social elites is of enduring quality and that some art created by artists that went against the ideals of the establishment endured.
Thought: This paragraph serves to inform the reader about how talented artists sometimes found a place in the margins of the establishment, and that the art produced may have gone against the grain of elite values. Additionally, the paragraph implies that the art produced may reflect the ideals of the elite, unbeknown to the elites.
Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. 
The answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The third paragraph begins by discussing how sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze art that expresses and mirrors the ideals and way of life of political and social elites. 
  It then goes on to explain that for this kind of analysis to work, the elites must have had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  The third paragraph also discusses how historically, the two social classes that were able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class.
Thought: 
  The third paragraph seems to be focused on clarifying the conditions under which sociohistorical analysis of art produced by political and social elites can be conducted. 
  Specifically, it identifies the assumptions that must hold for such an analysis to be meaningful and explains some of the limitations of such an analysis.
  It is not rejecting a possible response to the argument made in the first paragraph, nor is it presenting an argument that weakens the argument made in the second paragraph.
  Additionally, it is not offering additional evidence for the conclusion reached in the second paragraph.
  Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. 
  The answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. 
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the thought process presented.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The third paragraph discusses the social classes that commissioned art historically.
  The elite classes were aristocracy and upper middle class.
  The taste of these classes was not always able to produce enduring art.
Thought:
  The third paragraph provides additional information about the art production process mentioned in the first and second paragraphs.
  It highlights the fact that the upper classes were not always able to produce good art.
  This weakens the argument made in the second paragraph by showing that not all art produced by social elites was good or enduring.
  Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
  The answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Criticism:
  You are correct in stating that the third paragraph discusses the social classes that commissioned art historically.
  However, it does not weaken the argument made in the second paragraph.
  Instead, it provides additional context for understanding the type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
  So, the correct answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. This paragraph discusses the requirements necessary for the sociohistorical critics to analyze the way art embodied the ideology of the elite - elite must have a recognizable identity and display some kind of consensus about the world, and eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Therefore, the correct answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Response 8:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to:
Knowledge:
  The third paragraph discusses the limitations of the ability of the elite classes to produce art that endures and the difficulty of analyzing the ideology embodied in that art.
  The first sentence summarizes the historical context in which art was created by the elite for display.
  The next sentence discusses the second way the elite created art, which was by expressing and mirroring their own ideals and way of life.
  The following sentences discuss how sociohistorical critics analyze this second type of art to demonstrate how it embodied the ideology of the elite.
Thought:
  The main purpose of the third paragraph is to explain that not all art created by the elite for display embodied their ideals and to criticize sociohistorical critics for not being able to reliably demonstrate how this second type of art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  The paragraph also explains that artists sometimes had to find rich patrons with eccentric tastes to produce meaningful art, or produce art that went against the grain of elite values.
Criticism:
  This thought accurately reflects the content of the third paragraph. 
  However, the answer options do not fully reflect the content of the paragraph, as they focus more on the relationship between the first and second paragraph rather than the content of the third paragraph itself.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. 

Explanation:
The third paragraph discusses the two social classes- the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class that are able to commission art. It explains how the taste of these social classes has not always been able to produce an art that endures, and how the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment. The paragraph also mentions that a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. 

This paragraph identifies the assumptions such as the identity and consensus of the elite, and the possibility of the work subverting the ideals of the patron. These assumptions are relied upon by a type of analysis that Taruskin and others prefer to deal with, as stated in the first paragraph. Therefore, the correct answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.

Criticism:
  None. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses different ways in which art historically was "produced by and for political and social elites," and presents the two different methods of creating art for the elites. The author also mentions the two social classes that were able to commission art and shows that the taste of those classes was not always apt to produce art that endures. Finally, the author suggests that in some cases, art that went against elite values endured, which created a challenge for Sociohistorical critics when trying to analyze it.
Thought: 
  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example of a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, similar to the second way in which art was produced for and by political and social elites.
  The author does not use it simply to illustrate the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics or the influence of religion on the historical development of art.
  The author also does not use it to show how an artist can subvert the ideals of the patron.
  Rather, the author uses it to establish the idea that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
  Specifically, the Vatican, as a powerful patron, was unwillingly and with misgivings paying for art that went against its values, and this art endured in spite of the disagreement, which presents a challenge to the analysis of sociohistorical critics. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.

  The frescoes were commissioned by a member of the elite, Pope Julius II, for this purpose.
  Therefore, the answer is A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.
Criticism:
  There is no indication that the author is trying to emphasize the influence of religion on the historical development of art or to show how an artist can subvert the ideals of the patron, as suggested by options B and D.
  Likewise, while option C could be argued, it does not capture the full significance of Raphael's frescoes in the context of the author's argument.
  Option E is not mentioned in the passage.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements
  B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines
  C: a hypothetical situation supporting a statement reported by the author in the earlier lines
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients, the courts, and society.
  The passage states that lawyers have a twofold obligation to their clients and the court/society.
  Lawyers should not deny what they know to be true to the court.
  Lawyers should present their client's case as much in their favor as possible.
  Lawyers should not take every case they are offered, but advocate for their client's rights given the facts of the case.
Thought:
  Lines 7-11 argue that defense lawyers have no right to judge their clients and should provide the best defense they are capable of.
  Lines 28-31 state that if a lawyer is convinced their client is guilty, it is their duty to appraise the case in their client's favor and present extenuating circumstances while not denying the client's guilt.
  The sentences in lines 28-31 are discussing a lawyer's obligation to their clients and the courts/society, which was introduced in lines 7-11.
  Lines 28-31 offer specific guidelines for how a lawyer can advocate for their client's rights while also fulfilling their obligations to the court/society.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 is 'elaboration and specification', indicating that the latter provides an introductory idea and the former presents further explanation or clarification of that same idea.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism:
  No criticism.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients and to the court.
  The author argues that defense lawyers should not present false information to the court.
  The author argues that defense lawyers should not represent guilty clients as though they are innocent.
Thought:
  Lines 28-31 state that when a defense lawyer is certain that a client is guilty, they should not undertake to demonstrate innocence.
  This means that the defense lawyer should not present false information to the court.
  The earlier lines argue that the lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court/society.
  The author argues that lawyers should not present false information to the courts based on their obligation to the court/society.
  There is agreement between lines 28-31 and the earlier lines about the obligation of lawyers to be honest with the court, but disagreement specifically on representing guilty clients as innocent.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information in lines 28-31 to the earlier lines is best described as D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses whether defense lawyers must believe that their clients are innocent or not.
  Some legal scholars argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants and must provide the best defense possible.
  The author argues that the lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court/society, and that lawyers should not present assertions they know to be false.
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 28-31 says that, in cases where the lawyer knows with certainty that the client is guilty, the lawyer should not try to prove their innocence.
  This contradicts the earlier argument that lawyers have no right to judge defendants and must provide the best defense possible.
  The relationship between the two sentences is that the second sentence is in disagreement with the earlier argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: disagreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The text discusses legal scholars' opinions on the role of defense lawyers in representing their clients.
  The scholars' position is that lawyers have no right to judge defendants and should provide the best defense they are capable of.
  They argue that a lawyer's responsibility is to state the facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel.
Thought: 
  The text discusses the position of legal scholars about the role of defense lawyers.
  The scholars' position is that lawyers should provide the best defense they are capable of and not express personal opinions.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that defense lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  This sentence supports the scholars' position that lawyers' responsibility is to construct sound arguments based on the facts, not to express personal opinions.

  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 is that the information at lines 28-31 supports the position taken by the legal scholars, as presented in lines 7-11.

  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism: 
  None to consider. The answer is correct.
Response 4:
The relevant information indicates that lawyers have a dual obligation to their clients and to the court, and that a defense lawyer's obligation is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. The information at lines 28-31 states that "Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this." 

Therefore, the relationship of the information at lines 28-31 to that in the sentence at lines 7-11 can most accurately be described as clarification and elaboration of the author's position on the obligations of defense lawyers. 

Answer: E) essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses whether defense lawyers must believe their clients are innocent.
- The legal scholars mentioned in the passage argue that lawyers' obligation is to provide the best defense they can and not to judge whether their clients are guilty or innocent.
- Nevertheless, the passage asserts that defense lawyers have an obligation to the court and society. They should not present assertions that they know to be false, and should not try to prove innocence if they believe their client is guilty. 
Thought:
- The sentences at lines 28-31 say that lawyers should not take every case they are offered and should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant.
- These sentences could be interpreted as a further development of the legal scholars' position in the earlier lines. That position was that a lawyer's obligation is to provide the best defense, but not to express or act on personal opinions.
- By saying that lawyers should not take every case and should not be mere mouthpieces, the author may be clarifying that a lawyer's role is not to blindly advocate for a client regardless of the circumstances. 
- Therefore, the relationship of the sentences at lines 28-31 to the ones at lines 7-11 could most accurately be described as "clarification/elaboration". 
- Choice E, "essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives," seems incorrect because the sentences at lines 28-31 are different in tone and content from those at lines 7-11. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the obligation of a defense lawyer to their client, the court, and society.
  The author emphasizes that lawyers should not present to the court assertions that they know to be false.
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 7-11 presents the perspective of some legal scholars that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. The sentences at lines 28-31 indicate that the lawyer's obligation to the court and to society ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 are essentially equivalent assertions arising from a different perspective than the earlier sentences. 
  Therefore, the answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligations of defense lawyers to their clients, the court, and society.
  The passage suggests that defense lawyers do not have to believe that their clients are innocent, but they should not present assertions that they know to be false.
  The passage suggests that guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation.
Thought: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 read "In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent."
  This sentence can be related to the sentence at lines 7-11, which describes the belief held by some legal scholars that defense lawyers have no right to judge defendants and should advocate for their clients to the best of their ability.
  However, the sentence at lines 28-31 also qualifies the duty of defense lawyers to try to prove the innocence of their clients only if they sincerely believe them to be innocent.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information contained in the two sentences can be described as agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
  The author agrees that defense lawyers should provide the best defense they are capable of, but also qualifies this duty by suggesting that defense lawyers should only try to prove the innocence of their clients if they sincerely believe them to be innocent.
  This qualification implies that defense lawyers only have a duty to represent their clients to the best of their ability if they do not know that their clients are guilty.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the obligations and limitations placed on defense lawyers and argues that, although their obligation to the defendant is significant, the lawyer's responsibility to the court and society should not be overlooked. 
Thought:
  The question asks about the relationship between a sentence at lines 28-31 and a sentence at lines 7-11.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 discusses the opinions of legal scholars who argue that the lawyer's responsibility is to provide the best defense they are capable of and that lawyers have no right to judge defendants.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 discusses the duty of lawyers to present a defense that is not false or insincere, and that lawyers who know with certainty that a defendant is guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  These sentences are talking about the same topic: the obligation of defense lawyers.
  The first sentence is discussing the obligation to provide the best defense possible, and the second sentence is discussing the obligation to not present a false defense or argue against known facts.
  Therefore, the two sentences are not in disagreement but rather present different aspects of the same issue.
  Answer: E) essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients, the court, and society.
  Some legal scholars argue that the lawyer's sole obligation is to provide the best defense possible and not to express personal opinions.
  However, the lawyer's obligation is to the court and society as well as the defendant.
Thought:
  The sentences at lines 28-31 are discussing the lawyer's obligation to the court and society to act honestly in cases where they know their client is guilty.
  This connects to the earlier statement that defense lawyers have an obligation to their clients, the court, and society.
  The passage is arguing that the lawyer's role is twofold and that they should not provide false or insincere representation to the court.
  Therefore, the sentences at lines 28-31 are in agreement with the earlier position but indicate a limitation on the lawyer's obligation to their clients in cases where they know their clients are guilty.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: In what other areas besides Europe did Spanish-language proverbs currently used in Mexican American communities originate?
  B: Are any proverbs that are used frequently in the English-language tradition derived from Mexican American proverbs?

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: The primary purpose of the passage is most likely to
Choices:
  A: propose a new theory about the workings of the brain
  B: introduce evidence that challenges a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain
  C: describe the approach scientists use when studying the workings of the brain
  D: discuss new support for a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain
  E: illustrate the practical utility of scientific research into the workings of the brain
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the workings of the brain, specifically the transmission of signals between neurons. The first theory neurobiologists believed was that this communication was done through electrical signals leaping across synapses. However, an alternative theory arose that communication happened chemically rather than electrically, with neurons secreting a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its receptor to render the neuron permeable to ions and allow the electrical impulse to be transmitted. This theory has gained acceptance in the scientific community, and recent evidence has explained the process by which the neurotransmitter renders the receptor permeable to ions. As the passage ends, the discovery raises the possibility of designing drugs that selectively impede or enhance the effects of specific receptors found only on certain categories of neurons, which could help ameliorate various brain disorders.
Thought: 
  The passage is an overview of the history of the theories and research on the transmission of signals between neurons. Starting from the theories Neurobiologists once believed in, it moves on to the discovery of the alternative theory, and how recent evidence fills gaps in knowledge about it. It also briefly touches on the implications of the discovery for further medical research and treatment. 
  Therefore, the primary purpose of this passage is most likely to describe the recent developments in the theories and research on the transmission of signals between neurons in the brain.

Therefore, the primary purpose of the passage is to discuss new support for a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain.
The answer is D.
Criticism: 
None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how neurons in the brain communicate with each other through either electrical or chemical signals. 
  The traditional theory was that communication between neurons was electrical, but some neurobiologists have been skeptical of this theory since the 1900s.
  The alternative theory is that neurons communicate chemically through the use of neurotransmitters.
  The mechanism by which neurotransmitters render the receiving neuron permeable to ions so that electrical impulses can be transmitted was once unknown.
  However, new research shows that neurotransmitter-gated ion channels play a pivotal role in this mechanism.
  These channels have different varieties, and this discovery may lead to more targeted and selective medical treatments for certain brain disorders.
Thought: 
  The passage presents an alternative theory to traditional understanding of how neurons communicate in the brain.
  It explains how recent research has provided new insight into the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity, specifically the importance of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
  It also illustrates the practical application of these discoveries in medical treatment.
  The primary purpose of the passage is therefore to discuss new support for a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain, as well as illustrate the practical utility of scientific research into the workings of the brain.
  The answer is D: Discuss new support for a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain.
Criticism: 
  There are a few flaws in the thought process. 
  The passage does not present an alternative theory; it only mentions that an alternative theory was once suggested by some neurobiologists.
  Also, the passage provides in-depth information about the workings of neurotransmitters and ion channels, suggesting that it is more concerned with exploring this aspect of the brain rather than just presenting new support for an existing theory.
  So, the answer is not as clear-cut as just D. 
Action: Answer("D") with the caveat that it is not the most precise answer but the closest one available.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about the workings of the brain and how electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons.
  Neurobiologists initially believed in the electrical signaling theory but later accepted the chemical theory.
  The chemical theory describes that the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron.
  The structure of the receptor plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  Researchers discovered that the receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
Thought: 
  The primary purpose of the passage is to describe the workings of the brain and how electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons.
  The passage also explains how the chemical theory was discovered and provides recent evidence to support the theory.
  The author discusses how the structure of receptor plays a pivotal in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity and how the discovery of different receptors raises new possibilities for medical treatments.
  Therefore, the answer is D: discuss new support for a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain.

Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author suggests that the concept of self and writing means something different in the Native American cultures compared to European cultures.
Thought: 
  The author refers to "self, life, and writing" to point out how these concepts were perceived differently between Native American and European cultures.
  The author also mentions that the idea of self was inclusive in pre-contact Native American cultures, which could be in contrast to the European idea of self.
  Therefore, it is most likely that the author refers to "self, life, and writing" in order to identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
  The answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the author is defining the word "autobiography" or explaining how its meaning has changed over time.
  There is also no evidence that the author is suggesting a fundamental similarity in the origins of a concept in both European and Native American cultures.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the differences between European-style autobiography and Native American modes of communicating personal history.
  "Self, life, and writing" are concepts that underlie the European-style autobiography.
Thought:
  The passage contrasts European-style autobiography with Native American modes of communicating personal history.
  The passage mentions that before contact with Europeans, Native American cultures did not share the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography.
  Therefore, the author refers to "self, life, and writing" to identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
  The answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the differences between European and Native American concepts of autobiography and self-expression. It notes that European assumptions about self, life, and writing do not necessarily apply to pre-contact Native American cultures.
Thought:
  In the passage, the author refers to "self, life, and writing" to highlight the fact that European and Native American cultures had distinct assumptions about these concepts. The author notes that pre-contact Native American cultures had a more inclusive idea of self, and that their modes of self-expression were different from those of Europeans. The passage implies that using a European framework to study Native American autobiographical modes misses these differences.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Criticism: 
  The thought process is correct.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that the expression of life experiences in Native American cultures was different from that of Europeans.
  The passage makes reference to self, life, and writing in the context of how they differ between Native American and European cultures.
Thought: 
  The author mentions "self, life, and writing" to highlight that the differences in concepts of autobiography between Native American and European cultures go beyond just the concept of writing. 
  The differences also exist in the way one understands oneself and one's relation to society, life, and the cosmos.
  Therefore, A, B, C, and D are incorrect as they do not accurately capture the author's purpose in mentioning "self, life, and writing".
  E directly captures the author's purpose in discussing these three concepts and how they differ between Native American and European cultures.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how scholars have mostly studied written autobiographies of Native Americans recorded by non-Native American collaborators. However, these scholars have overlooked pre-literate modes of communicating personal history which were prevalent among native cultures. In these cultures, the idea of self was more inclusive and identity was not seen as merely individual. Rather, it was relational to society, landscape, and cosmos. 
Thought:
  The phrase "self, life, and writing" is cited in order to illustrate the contrasting ideas of Europeans and Native Americans about these three concepts. European and Native American ideas about self, life, and writing were different, which points to the differences in their respective cultural constructions. 
  Therefore, the answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention of changes in the meaning of "self, life, and writing" after their introduction into any language. Therefore, C is not the answer.
  Similarly, the passage does not mention current vs. contemporary Native American cultural perspectives. Therefore, B and E are not correct answers. 
  Finally, while it is true that the passage describes some differences in cultural perspectives, it does not attempt to posit fundamental similarities between European and Native Americans cultures. Therefore, D is incorrect.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception
  D: questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence
  E: countering a revolutionary hypothesis
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")

In the given passage, the author is primarily concerned with "correcting a scientific misconception". The passage discusses the healthful effects of wine, which have been disregarded by scientists who assume that wine, like other alcoholic beverages, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. The author provides evidence to show that wine has several healthful effects, such as decreasing the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, reducing platelet adhesiveness, and increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound. Furthermore, the author argues that these healthful effects should not be confused with the negative physiological effects of excessive or abusive intake of these beverages. Therefore, the correct answer is C: correcting a scientific misconception.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")

In the passage, the author critiques the assumption of most scientists with regard to the effects of wine. The author is primarily concerned with correcting a scientific misconception about wine that has led to incorrect scientific assumptions regarding the effects of moderate wine consumption on the body. Therefore, the correct answer is C: correcting a scientific misconception.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: 
The passage discusses how most scientists have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. The author challenges this assumption by highlighting how moderate wine consumption can have healthful effects (such as slow absorption into the bloodstream, increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound, and reduced platelet adhesiveness). The author is primarily concerned with correcting a scientific misconception that wine is similar to beer or distilled spirits with respect to its effects on the body and health. Therefore, the correct answer is C: correcting a scientific misconception.
Response 3:
Answer: C: correcting a scientific misconception
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")

The passage criticizes the scientific misconception that wine is considered the same as other alcoholic beverages in terms of its active ingredient, alcohol. This misconception has led researchers to ignore the health benefits of moderate wine consumption and its potential role in ameliorating the development of heart disease. Therefore, the author's primary concern is correcting a scientific misconception. The answer is C: correcting a scientific misconception.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")

The author's main concern is to correct a scientific misconception. The passage discusses a scientific assumption that wine is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol and how this assumption has led scientists to study the effects of wine in the same way as other alcoholic beverages, without distinguishing the potential health benefits of wine. However, recently, a group of researchers has questioned this assumption and found that moderate wine consumption has potential health benefits, which may be derived from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")

The passage primarily focuses on correcting a scientific misconception. The passage points out that most people assume that the effects of all types of alcoholic beverages are the same, but this assumption has caused many scientists to ignore the potential health benefits of wine specifically. The author argues that recent research has found that wine has health benefits not found in other types of alcohol, and the author explains why this might be the case. Therefore, the best answer is C: correcting a scientific misconception. The other answer choices are not supported by the passage. The author is not advocating for a particular method of treatment (A), criticizing popular opinion (B), questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence (D), or countering a revolutionary hypothesis (E).
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")

The author argues against the assumption of most scientists that all alcoholic beverages have the same effects on the body. Instead, the author emphasizes the differences between wine and other alcoholic drinks and discusses the potential health benefits associated with moderate wine consumption. Therefore, the author's primary concern is to correct a scientific misconception. The answer is C: correcting a scientific misconception.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")

The author primarily concerns with correcting a scientific misconception in the passage. The passage explains that the traditional studies on the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have overlooked the health benefits of wine and misunderstood wine as an ordinary alcoholic beverage. The passage goes on to introduce research that investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption and suggests that wine has healthful effects on the body, which were previously ignored by scientists due to their assumption. Therefore, Choice C, "correcting a scientific misconception" best describes the author's primary purpose in the passage.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C")

The passage argues that there is a scientific misconception about the physiological effects of wine, which has prevented scientists from investigating the specific effects of wine as a drink distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Therefore, the author is primarily concerned with correcting this scientific misconception. The passage presents the findings of a recent study, which investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption and discovered that wine has healthful effects that other alcoholic beverages do not have. The passage also explains the physiological processes through which wine has these healthful effects, such as decreasing the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels and reducing platelet adhesiveness. Therefore, the correct answer is C: correcting a scientific misconception.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  The interpretation involves a subtraction of a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement.
  The resulting measurement is thought to represent only the metabolic activity associated with the cognitive task.
Thought: 
  The passage describes the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity as a subtraction of a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement.
  The reasoning is that the resulting difference shows only the metabolic activity associated with the cognitive task in question.
  Thus, the method subtracts out all the distributed brain functions to give a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The process described is most analogous to subtraction used in option B.
  In option B, a store had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, and the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  Similarly, in the interpretation of FMRI scans, the metabolic activity associated with the cognitive task is determined by subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurements.
  Therefore, Option B is most analogous to the described process.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how brain scans, particularly FMRI scans, are used in psychological research, and how they are typically interpreted.
  FMRI scans work by taking a baseline measurement of brain activity, then taking a second measurement of brain activity while the subject is performing a cognitive task, and finally subtracting the baseline measurement from the second measurement to produce a differential brain scan that reveals which brain regions are active during the cognitive task.
Thought: 
  The question asks for an analogy to the method by which FMRI scans are typically interpreted.
  The passage suggests that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and may create a false impression of neat functional localization.
  A: This analogy does not capture the essence of the method of interpreting FMRI scans.
  B: This analogy does not capture the essence of the method of interpreting FMRI scans.
  C: This analogy does not capture the essence of the method of interpreting FMRI scans.
  D: This analogy does not capture the essence of the method of interpreting FMRI scans.
  E: This analogy highlights the idea that most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances, which is analogous to the idea that the entire brain is active during both the control and cognitive task conditions, and that a differential brain scan may create a false impression of functional localization. However, the analogy is imprecise and the two situations are not strictly analogous. 
Criticism: 
  The analogy is not perfect, as the comparison between the FMRI scan and the cheetah situation is not exact. 
  The FMRI method does not preclude all functional localization in the brain, only the idea that mental activity can be decomposed into independent modules, and the fact that the entire brain is active does not necessarily mean that all cognitive processes are distributed equally throughout the brain.
  The other answer choices are straightforward to eliminate.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain to show metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. 
  The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The scan is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The reasoning is, whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  So, the FMRI scan focus only on the differential rate of oxygen use, not the entire brain activity.
  Similarly, in choice B, the advertising campaign affected only the summer shoppers and not all year round shoppers.
  Therefore, Choice B is the most analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  This passage discusses the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans as a research method in psychology.
  The scans are interpreted as maps of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  They are used to identify areas of the brain that are active during particular cognitive tasks, by subtracting a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement to identify areas of the brain that are active during cognitive tasks.
  This analysis may be flawed because it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, we are looking for an answer choice that involves the interpretation of data in a way that obscures important information.
  Answer choice C presents a situation where an analysis of data highlighting differences may obscure significant commonalities.
  In this case, the fact that drought affects both agricultural and residential customers is obscured when comparing water usage.
  This parallels the problem with subtractive analysis of FMRI scans, where a comparison of on-task and off-task brain activity obscures the fact that the whole brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans interpret brain activity as the differential rate of oxygen use between a control condition and an on-task measurement.
Thought:
  The question asks about an analogy to describe how FMRI scans interpret brain activity. 
  The best analogy is one where the interpretation of a difference highlights or isolates a particular aspect of a broader phenomenon.
  A: This analogy does not work because one particular district is only one part of a larger whole, which is different from isolating one function of the brain during an FMRI scan.
  B: This analogy also does not work because the advertising campaign was successful only during the summer, which is different from isolating one type of brain activity during an FMRI scan.
  C: This analogy does not work because it only describes which sector of customers uses more water, which is different from isolating one type of brain activity during an FMRI scan.
  D: This analogy could work because it highlights a specific time period when most internet traffic originates from homes, which is similar to the way in which FMRI scans isolate brain activity for a specific cognitive task. However, the analogy is not the best option.
  E: This analogy works well because the cheetah's distinction as the fastest land animal is limited to short distances, which is similar to how FMRI scans isolate one aspect of brain activity during a cognitive task.
Criticism: 
  The analogies for A, B, C, and D do not fit the question, but they are all plausible options.
  However, the analogy for E is not a perfect fit because the fastest land animal analogy is about the limitation of cheetahs over long distances rather than highlighting a specific aspect of their fast running. The analogy may not be clear for those who are not familiar with the cheetah's running abilities.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a way of examining mental activity in psychology.
  Specifically, it talks about the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans.
  FMRI scans look at the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain and are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from a task-oriented measurement.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted by using a subtractive method, in which the data from a control condition is subtracted from the data from a cognitive task condition. 
  This method assumes that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The reasoning is that this method can reveal functional localization in the brain.
  In other words, it can reveal the specific areas of the brain that are associated with different cognitive tasks.
  Therefore, the method used to interpret FMRI data is most similar to the way the advertisements in (B) are assumed to have affected only summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans, specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), in psychology as a research method.
  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, standing as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The subtractive method of interpreting FMRI scans involves taking a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task, and subtracting the baseline from the on-task measurement to obtain an image of the brain at work on the task in question.
Thought: 
  The subtractive method of interpreting FMRI scans involves taking two measurements and subtracting the baseline, resulting in a map of brain activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. 
  To identify an analogous scenario, we need an example where a measure is obtained by subtracting a baseline from a measurement under different conditions in order to obtain information solely about one of those conditions.
  A and E do not involve a baseline or two measurements that are subtracted from. 
  B involves a yearlong advertising campaign, which is different from obtaining measurements. 
  C involves comparing consumption by two groups rather than obtaining two measurements of the same quantity.
  D involves identifying a pattern of behavior rather than obtaining two measurements.
  None of the choices seem to be a good match for the process of interpreting FMRI scans.
 
Criticism: 
  None of the choices seem to be a good match for the process of interpreting FMRI scans, and there is no clear analogous process to FMRI scans described in the choices.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of metabolic activity in different parts of the brain in response to a cognitive task. The interpretation involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement obtained while the task is being performed, which obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Thought:
  FMRI scans are interpreted by taking a baseline measurement of oxygen use in the brain and subtracting it from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  This subtraction method gives the impression of functional localization, although the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The question asks for an analogy to this method of interpretation.
  One possible analogy is option D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  Just as peak Internet traffic originates in homes, peak metabolic activity in a particular part of the brain during a cognitive task is determined by subtracting out baseline activity, which is assumed to be relatively constant across the entire brain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  FMRI is a research method used in psychology that produces images indicating the metabolic activity or rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  FMRI images are produced using a subtraction method, which takes a baseline measurement of brain activity and subtracts it from the measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  This subtraction method results in images that obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Thought:
  The FMRI subtraction method results in images that show differential brain activity that is associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This method is analogous to which of the following scenarios?
  A: The election of a new mayor was won by a particular voting district.
  B: A store's year-long advertising campaign only affected the number of shoppers during the summer.
  C: Agricultural customers use more water than residential customers, so they are impacted most by droughts.
  D: Internet traffic originating in homes is higher during the evening than in office buildings.
  E: Cheetahs are only the world's fastest land animals for short distances and cannot outrun other animals over long distances.
  None of these options seem to match the method of interpreting FMRI scans of brain activity.
Criticism: 
  The answer choices do not seem to be analogous to the method of interpreting FMRI scans of brain activity.
  It is possible that there is another analogy that is not included in the choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the manner in which functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, but what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use.
  A baseline measurement is taken in the control condition, and a second measurement is taken while the subject is performing some cognitive task. 
  The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement, and whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. 
Thought: 
  The FMRI scans are interpreted based on subtracting out the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
  Whatever remains after the subtraction is deemed to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  This is analogous to option B, where the increase in shoppers was only observed during the summer, so it was concluded that the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Criticism: 
  Option B could be viewed as a "false positive", where the observed increase in shoppers during the summer may not have been due to the advertising campaign.
  In contrast, the subtractive method used for FMRI scans is not necessarily a "false positive", but it does obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, option B is not the best analogy for the interpretation of FMRI scans in the passage.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education that advocate different methods for understanding other cultures.
  The second version of multicultural education holds that cultures should be studied on their own terms and not judged by the standards of another culture.
  Critics of this second version argue that Western scientific methods are still being used to examine other cultures in this approach, and that these methods are value-laden and distort the understanding of non-Western cultures.
Thought: 
  Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph argue that the methods of scientific examination employed by the second version of multicultural education are fundamentally flawed.
  They argue that understanding of non-Western cultures requires adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  Option E suggests that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
  This option is consistent with the critics' view that Western scientific methods are insufficient for understanding non-Western cultures.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The second version of multicultural education maintains a neutral stance towards different values among cultures to try to understand them in their own terms. Their methods are identifiably Western such as those of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology.
Critics argue that the scientific heritage is based on Western values of objectivity, logic, and empirically verifiable facts, and thus a non-Western culture can't be understood by Western methods, and to do so would be distorting and an expression of cultural chauvinism.
Thought:
- Critics argue that using a Western scientific lens to understand other cultures is distorting and thus ineffective to achieve multicultural understanding.
- According to critics, Western scientific methods rely on Western values of objectivity over subjectivity and logic over intuition, which are not necessarily the values that other cultures hold.
- Therefore, understanding other cultures can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
- This would be most aligned with choice "E": The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Criticism:
- While critics argue that using Western scientific methods to understand other cultures is a distorting lens that doesn't allow us to fully understand different cultures, and that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied would be a better approach, the question isn't specifically asking which method is better or worse.
- The question is asking which answer choice critics who raised the objection in the second paragraph would most likely agree with.
- Choice "A" is too general and doesn't just apply to the objection that critics raised in the second paragraph. 
- Choice "B" is a statement that could apply to both the objection raised and the response to the objection, so it doesn't necessarily align with either. 
- Choice "C" is also not specific to the objection raised in the second paragraph. 
- Choice "D" is not what critics argue; it's actually the opposite of what they argue because they are saying that understanding another culture is possible even if it doesn't share the same cultural values. 
- Therefore, the answer is "E": The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about two proposals of multicultural education. 
  The first proposal suggests that schools teach other cultures proceeding from within the context of the majority culture. 
  The second proposal suggests a neutral stance be adopted with respect to value differences among cultures, with each culture being taken on its own terms.
  Critics of the first proposal argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is not possible when it is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. 
  Critics of the second proposal argue that the Western scientific heritage, upon which the methods of examination of cultures are based, prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical, and therefore, is an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. 
Thought:
  The critics of the second proposal argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and based on Western scientific heritage, and therefore, it is not possible to understand other cultures through these methods.
  These critics might argue that understanding the non-Western cultures needs the adoption of (often) non-scientific perspectives and methods used by these cultures themselves.
  So, the answer could be E.
Criticism:
  You are correct in your interpretation of the objection raised by the critics of the second proposal. 
  However, option E only states the objection of the critics of the second proposal and does not reflect their view on any of the culture-study-related aspects. 
  So, option E could be a part of their objection, but it does not reflect their opinion on the study of cultures.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education: one advocates teaching about other cultures using the values of the majority culture, and the other advocates adopting a neutral stance that treats each culture on its own terms.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is inadequate and is an expression of cultural chauvinism.
Thought:
  The critics in the second paragraph argue that Western scientific methods are inadequate for studying non-Western cultures.
  Western scientific methods are based on objectivity and empirical verification, which may not be valued or present in non-Western cultures.
  In order to understand a non-Western culture, it is necessary to adopt the perspectives and methods of that culture.
  Therefore, the critics would most likely agree with the statement that "The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science."
  The other options are not directly related to the criticism raised in the second paragraph.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses multiple proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal advocates for teaching about other cultures using methods and values of the majority culture.
  The second proposal advocates for adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that the methods of Western science are already value-laden.
Thought:
  The question is asking for the position most likely to be held by the critics who raised the objection discussed in the second paragraph.
  The criticism argues that non-scientific cultures cannot be understood by Western scientific methods.
  Therefore, the critics are likely to agree that aspects of a culture beyond its values, such as social and historical circumstances, play an important role in its development and should be studied from multiple cultural perspectives.
  Answer B states that historical and social circumstances play an important role in the development of a culture's values and is thus the most likely answer.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education in the context of the United States and Canada.
  The first proposal advocates teaching about other cultures from within the perspective of the majority culture.
  The second proposal is more neutral and rejects the idea that the majority culture's perspective is the only valid one.
  Critics argue that the methods of social-scientific examination used in the second proposal are themselves value-laden and reflect the Western scientific heritage.
Thought: 
  Critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that despite the claim to be neutral, the approach is still distorting, as Western scientific methods do not align with exactly how other cultures view their practices.
  Thus, the answer should be one that argues against the use of Western science in understanding multiculturalism.
  Option A is incorrect, as the critics of the second version of multicultural education believe that understanding other cultures is possible, regardless of value differences.
  Option B is also incorrect, as this statement is not related to the argument presented by the critics.
  Option C is partially true as the critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that the approach is still distorting, but the option is not comprehensive.
  Option D is incorrect as it presupposes that multicultural understanding is impossible.
  Option E is the best answer, as critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that "scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures," and methods of understanding are based on an epistemological system that "prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical."
Criticism: 
  No known criticisms.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses two different proposals for multicultural education.
- Proponents of the first proposal believe that students should learn about other cultures from within the context of their own culture, using the values of liberalism (democracy, tolerance, and equality) as a basis for understanding.
- Critics of the first proposal argue that studying other cultures through the lens of one's own culture can be distorting and that genuine understanding requires adopting the perspective and methods of the culture being studied.
- The second proposal for multicultural education suggests taking a neutral stance with respect to value differences and adopting Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
- Critics of the second proposal argue that Western scientific methods represent a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism and cannot fully capture the non-scientific perspectives and methods of other cultures.

Thought:
- The question asks which statement the critics discussed in the second paragraph would agree with.
- The critics argue that Western scientific methods are inadequate for understanding non-Western cultures and that attempting to understand other cultures solely through these methods is an expression of cultural chauvinism.
- The answer that best captures this perspective is E, which states that the values of liberalism cannot be understood adequately through the methods of Western science.
- This answer is consistent with the idea that different cultures have different perspectives and that understanding them requires adopting those perspectives.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The second version of multicultural education advocates taking a neutral stance with respect to cultural value differences, but still uses Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
- Critics of this version argue that the Western scientific perspective is already value-laden and that trying to understand other cultures using these methods is distorting and an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Thought:
- The objection mentioned in the second paragraph is specifically about the use of Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
- The critics of this second version of multicultural education argue that it is not possible to achieve real understanding of another culture simply by approaching it from a Western scientific perspective.
- Therefore, the most likely answer is E, which states that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Criticism:
- None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:

Thought:
  The second paragraph is discussing the objection to the second proposal for multicultural education.
  The objection is that Western scientific methods are already value-laden and may distort our understanding of other cultures.
  Therefore, critics who raise this objection would likely prefer a method of studying other cultures that involves adopting the perspectives and methods of those cultures themselves.
  Among the choices given, only option E acknowledges the limitations of Western scientific methods and suggests the need to approach non-Western cultures from a different perspective.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses objections to the first and second proposals for multicultural education.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and the role of secondary substances, which give plants their unique tastes and smells. These substances have evolved over time due to interactions between plants and insects, with some serving as defenses against insect predators. Natural selection plays a role in determining which mutations and secondary substances are conserved in plant species.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage seems to be that the distinctive tastes and smells of plants result from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. Over millions of years, plants and insects have engaged in a competitive relationship, with plants developing a variety of secondary substances to defend against insect predators. Some of these substances serve as signals to attract pollinating insects, while others cause unpleasant symptoms or even death. Insects have evolved ways to circumvent plant defenses, and this competition has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and the range of insect species that eat each species of plant. Therefore, the answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Criticism: 
  While the passage does discuss the role of secondary substances in defending against insect predators, it is not the primary focus of the passage. The main point is that the distinctive tastes and smells of plants result from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and how they use secondary substances to defend themselves against insect damage.
  The secondary substances in plants do not serve a known role in internal chemical processes, but rather give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Natural selection has favored secondary substances that helped plants survive insect damage.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how plants use secondary substances to defend against insect damage.
  These secondary substances have resulted from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
  Due to long-term competition between plants and insects, secondary substances have become numerous and diverse, but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
  The answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Criticism: 
  The passage also discusses how insects have played a major role in the appearance of secondary substances in plants, and how natural selection has favored those substances that helped plants survive insect damage.
  However, these points are supporting details that provide evidence for the main point that the unique tastes and smells of plants primarily result from their evolutionary interaction with insects.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")

The main point of the passage is that the distinctive tastes and smells of plants are the result of an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. The passage explains that secondary substances in plants are responsible for giving plants their distinctive characteristics, and it goes on to describe how these substances may have arisen as a result of genetic mutations. The passage also explains that some of these substances are favored by natural selection because they attract pollinating insects, while others act as biochemical defenses against insect enemies of plants. The passage further explains that insects have evolved ways to circumvent the plants' defenses, and as a result, species of insects have become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants. Choice (C) accurately expresses the main point of the passage by summarizing the role of the evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects in creating the distinctive tastes and smells of plants.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses plant chemistry, specifically primary and secondary substances.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive smells and tastes.
  Insects played a major role in the development of these secondary substances, whether as a means of attracting pollinators or as a defense against herbivores.
  Over time, insects have evolved to circumvent plant defenses and prefer certain plant species.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the relationship between plants and insects and how it has led to the development of secondary substances in plants. 
  These substances serve a dual purpose of attracting pollinators and defending against herbivores.
  As a result of this relationship, the range of secondary substances present in plants has narrowed over time, as have the range of insects that feed on a particular plant species.
  The main point of the passage is that the distinctive tastes and smells of plants result from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
  Option C is therefore the most accurate expression of the passage's main point.
Criticism: 
  While it is true that the passage discusses the relationship between plants and insects, it may be too narrow in scope to be the main point.
  The passage also discusses how secondary substances serve as defense mechanisms and attractants, as well as how insects evolve to circumvent plant defenses.
  Therefore, Option A and E may also be possible contenders for the main point.

A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects. - This expresses the defensive mechanisms, but it is not the main point of the passage.
B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant. - While this discusses the relationship between plants and insects, it does not express the main point of the passage.
C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. - This best describes the main point of the passage.
D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species. - This is mentioned in the passage, but it is not the main point of the passage.
E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects. - This is a part of the passage but is not the main point.
Therefore, the answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")

The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and how secondary substances, which give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, often arose through genetic mutations favored by natural selection. The passage also describes how insects have played a role in the evolution of these secondary substances, as some provide defenses against plant-eating insects and others attract pollinating insects to blossoms.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials
  C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial
  D: theorize that stealing thunder is best done as early as possible in a case, before the opposition has an opportunity to solidify jurors' opinions
  E: speculate that creating credibility in some cases is probably more effective than positively framing very harmful information
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The author discusses how jurors create a "cognitive framework."
- This framework is created early in the trial.
Thought:
- According to the passage, this "cognitive framework" is likely to be influenced by information mentioned early in a trial.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create and how it can influence the way they evaluate information presented later in the trial.
  A: The passage does mention that some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial (lines 55-56).
  B: The passage does mention that jurors bring into the court with them certain attitudes and biases that inform their opinions during trials (lines 47-48).
  C: The passage does mention that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial (lines 50-54).
  D: The passage does not theorize that stealing thunder is best done as early as possible in a case, before the opposition has an opportunity to solidify jurors' opinions. Though it does make a point about jurors being eager to solidify their position regarding the case (lines 57-58).
  E: The passage does speculate that creating credibility in some cases is probably more effective than positively framing very harmful information (lines 35-39).
Thought: 
  The question asks why the author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create.
  The passage mentions that jurors are eager to solidify their position regarding the case.
  Therefore, the "cognitive framework" likely refers to the jurors' initial impressions of the case, which can influence the way they evaluate information presented later in the trial.
  Given these thoughts, option A seems to be the best answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create primarily to indicate how early information in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.
  A: Choice A accurately summarizes the author's discussion of the cognitive framework.
  B: While jurors' attitudes and biases may influence their opinions during trials, the discussion of the cognitive framework is specifically related to the impact of information presented early in a trial.
  C: While framing can play a role in the impact of evidence, the discussion of the cognitive framework is specifically related to the timing of evidence presentation.
  D: While the author does suggest that stealing thunder can be effective, the discussion of the cognitive framework is not focused on the timing of this strategy.
  E: While creating credibility and positively framing information are discussed as potentially effective strategies, the discussion of the cognitive framework is not focused on evaluating the relative effectiveness of these strategies.
Thought:
  The passage discusses how early information in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.
  The author mentions that the cognitive framework jurors create can form an early negative impression that influences how they perceive subsequent information.
  Therefore, the author discusses the cognitive framework primarily to indicate that early information mentioned in a trial can influence jurors' evaluation of subsequent information.
  The best answer is A.
Criticism:
  I did not identify any flaws in my previous analysis.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Passage B differs from passage A in that analogous displays an attitude toward the ideas it discusses that is more
Choices:
  A: engaged
  B: dismissive
  C: detached
  D: ironic
  E: skeptical
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A presents recent findings in neuroscience that challenge the idea that all behavior is the result of free will and suggests a change in the focus of the criminal-justice system. 
  Passage B discusses the philosophical concept of free will in light of determinism and proposes a theory of "soft determinism" that allows for free actions that are not constrained by external sources.
Thought: 
  Passage A appears to take the position that the traditional concept of free will is not supported by recent neuroscience findings and should be abandoned in the criminal-justice system, while passage B proposes a nuanced view of free will that can coexist with determinism. 
  Based on this, it seems that passage B is more skeptical of determinism and more engaged with the philosophical discussion of free will than passage A, which takes a more pragmatic approach to the implications of neuroscience for the law. 
  Therefore, the answer is E: skeptical.
Criticism: 
  It could be argued that both passages are engaged with their respective topics, and that the difference in tone between them is not as clear-cut as suggested by the question. 
  While passage A may be more focused on practical applications of neuroscience for the law, it still presents a radical perspective on the nature of free will that could be seen as a form of engagement with the philosophical debate.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how the findings in neuroscience changes the way we should think about the law. It suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harms, rather than punishing bad people because of their freely chosen immoral acts. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determination, and how they can coexist.
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses a new approach to the criminal-justice system that is based on the findings in neuroscience. 
  Passage B discusses a philosophical idea about free will and determination that can coexist. 
  It seems that the attitude in Passage A is more engaged and direct, as it proposes a new approach based on the findings in neuroscience. 
  On the other hand, the attitude in Passage B is more detached and philosophical, as it discusses a concept that has been debated for centuries. 
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning for choosing C: detached is accurate based on the information provided in the passages.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that one's behavior is caused by the operations of one's brain, and suggest that the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution and focus on deterring future harms. 
  Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B have different topics, so it is difficult to say anything about the attitude of Passage B to the ideas of Passage A.
  However, the tone of Passage B seems to be neutral and explanatory.
  It explains the concept of "soft determinism" and Ayer's argument about free and constrained actions.
  There is no evidence of an attitude that is dismissive, detached, ironic, skeptical, or engaged.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the implications of neuroscience on the law and punishment.
  Passage B discusses the possibility of free will in light of determinism.
  A: engaged means showing interest or involvement.
  B: dismissive means showing a lack of interest or respect for something.
  C: detached means showing a lack of emotion or involvement.
  D: ironic means using language that conveys a meaning other than the literal meaning, often for humorous or emphatic effect.
  E: skeptical means having doubts or reservations about something.
Thought: 
  Passage B presents a counterargument to determinism, suggesting that free will can still exist.
  The language used seems factual and exploratory in tone, as opposed to emotionally charged.
  Passage A is making a strong argument against the traditional justification for punishment, and suggests a radical shift in thinking is necessary for the law.
  The language used is more opinionated in tone and urges action.
  Therefore, the attitude in Passage A is more engaged while the attitude in Passage B is more detached.
  The answer is option C: detached.
Criticism: 
  Your evaluation is correct.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses neuroscience and its impact on law. It suggests radical changes in the way law should be thought about, including abandoning retribution as a justification for punishment and focusing instead on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses determinism and free will. It presents Ayer's theory of soft determinism, in which actions are free as long as they are not constrained by external sources.
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that the law should change the way it thinks about punishment and focus on deterrence instead of retribution. It cites neuroscience findings to support this argument. 
  Passage B discusses determinism and free will and presents Ayer's theory of soft determinism. 
  While both passages present arguments on different topics, neither is dismissive or skeptical of the ideas being discussed. 
  Passage A is engaged and suggests changes to the law. 
  Passage B is detached and explains Ayer's theory of soft determinism without a strong engagement with the topic.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that criminal law should shift from retribution to deterrence due to the insights gained from neuroscience.
  Passage B discusses the compatibilism of determinism and free will and argues that actions originating from a disease-free brain are free.
Thought: 
  Passage B does not express a particular attitude toward the ideas discussed but presents a theory (soft determinism) that is compatible with free will.
  Passage A, on the other hand, advocates for a shift in the criminal justice system based on insights gained from neuroscience and criticizes the idea of retribution as a justification for punishment.
  Therefore, Passage A is more "engaged" in advocating for a particular perspective and criticizing a pre-existing perspective, while Passage B is more "detached" in presenting a theory without advocating for any particular perspective.
  The answer is C: detached.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant criticism of the original answer. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the way recent findings in neuroscience change the way we think about the law. It suggests the law should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution, which is now the dominant idea of punishment.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will coexisting with determinism proposed by philosopher Alfred J. Ayer. It distinguishes between free and constrained actions and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses the way recent findings in neuroscience radically changes the way we think about the law and suggests a different approach to punishment. 
  Passage B discusses Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" and the idea of free will coexisting with determinism. 
  Neither passage seems to express a particular attitude towards the ideas presented. 
  The tone in the passages seems detached and objective.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct based on both the passages and it is the most suitable option among the given choices.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the implications of neuroscientific research on the criminal justice system, and argues against the dominant view of retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will as it relates to determinism, and argues that free will can coexist with determinism.
Thought: 
  Both passages are discussing the same general topic of how neuroscience affects our understanding of free will and moral responsibility, but they approach the topic from different perspectives.
  Passage A is more critical of the current legal system, and argues that the idea of retribution should be abandoned.
  Passage B is more analytical, and argues that the concept of free will is compatible with determinism.
  Therefore, passage A is more engaged, while passage B is more detached.
  The answer is C: detached.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence to suggest that passage A is more critical of the current legal system.
  Instead, passage A is more focused on the implications of neuroscience on the legal system, while passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world.
  Additionally, although passage B is more analytical in nature, it still expresses a clear opinion on the compatibility of free will and determinism.
  Therefore, the distinction between the passages in terms of engagement is not clear-cut.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the relationship between neuroscience and the law, and suggests that the law should focus on deterrence rather than retribution in order to prevent future crimes. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will, and argues that actions can still be free in a deterministic world as long as they are not constrained.
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B have different topics that they address.
  Passage A is focused on the relationship between neuroscience and the law, and suggests that the law should change its focus.
  Passage B on the other hand, is focused on the concept of free will, and argues that actions can still be free in a deterministic world as long as they are not constrained.
  Based on this, it is difficult to say that Passage B displays a particular attitude toward the ideas it discusses that is more engaged, dismissive, detached, ironic, or skeptical than Passage A.
  Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how neuroscience challenges the traditional view of law and punishment in favor of a more deterrence-based approach.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world, building on Ayer's theory of soft determinism.
Thought: 
  In terms of attitude, Passage A presents a clear argument for change and potential reform of the criminal justice system, citing insights from neuroscience research.
  Passage B takes a more analytical and academic approach, exploring a philosophical issue and building on previous theories.
  While both passages are serious in tone and aim to present well-supported ideas, Passage B does not show a dismissive attitude towards the ideas presented.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.
Criticism: 
  There is no doubt that Passage B takes a more analytical and academic approach than Passage A.
  However, it could be argued that neither passage is completely detached as both present a point of view.
  Additionally, there is no evidence of irony or skepticism in either passage.
  So, the best answer may be somewhat subjective.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the attitude of Matthew Arnold toward the aristocratic and middle classes can best be described as one of

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education - a modest proposal that promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture and a second proposal that advocates for a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that it is still essentially the same as the first proposal because the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western.
Thought: 
  The objection to the second proposal is that it is still essentially the same as the first proposal because the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still Western.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism of the second proposal would have to disprove this claim.
  Option C provides a counterexample where some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values. This weakens the claim that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are solely Western and not determined by the culture doing the examination, study, and explanation.
  Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education. 
  The first proposal advocates teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture, while the second proposal argues for a neutral stance with respect to differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that using Western methods to study other cultures is still value-laden and distorts understanding.
Thought: 
  The strongest objection to the criticism of the second proposal would be a claim that using Western methods to study non-Western cultures does not necessarily distort understanding. 
  Choice C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures, which would counter the objection that using Western methods distorts understanding.
Criticism: 
  While choice C may suggest that using Western methods to study cultures is not necessarily distorting, it is not a strong enough objection to counter the criticism. 
  Just because some non-Western societies may use their own value system when studying cultures does not refute the argument that Western methods are inherently value-laden.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education, both of which aim to promote multicultural understanding. 
  The first version argues that schools should teach about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture, using its values as the basis for examination. 
  Critics of this version argue that this approach is biased and distorts understanding.
  The second version argues that schools should adopt a neutral stance towards cultural value differences, but the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western. 
  Critics of this approach argue that these methods reflect a Western cultural bias that is not appropriate for studying non-Western cultures.
Thought: 
  The strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would have to challenge the idea that Western scientific methods are inherently biased and cannot be used to study non-Western cultures. 
  Option D argues that students cannot understand Western culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigation. 
  This suggests that Western scientific methods have value and can contribute to understanding cultural achievements, even in Western cultures.
Criticism: 
  Option A is incorrect because one can learn about and adopt the perspectives and methods of different cultures without being a member of those cultures. 
  Option B is incorrect because even though some non-Western societies may have similar value systems, this does not challenge the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. 
  Option C is incorrect because it suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value systems when studying other cultures, but this does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education specifically. 
  Option E is incorrect because it does not provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, but rather supports the idea that genuine understanding of other cultures is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education, with the first proposal advocating for teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values, and the second proposing a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures, while still using Western scientific methods.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second proposal is that Western scientific methods are value-laden, and using them to understand non-Western cultures is distorting and maintains a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  To provide the strongest objection to this criticism, we need to show that Western scientific methods can be used to understand non-Western cultures without distorting them or maintaining cultural chauvinism.
  Options A, B, C, and E do not address this criticism directly.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the criticism and focuses on understanding Western culture's achievements.
  Thus, none of the options provide the strongest objection to the criticism. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education that differ in their approach to examining other cultures and understanding their value systems.
  The second version of multicultural education holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms, free from the standards of other cultures or values imposed by the majority culture, but it still adopts Western methods of social-scientific examination.
  Critics argue that Western scientific methods are inherently value-laden and that true understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
Thought: 
  The objection to the second version of multicultural education is that Western scientific methods are inherently value-laden and cannot provide genuine understanding of non-Western cultures.
  To provide a strong objection, we need a statement that indicates that Western scientific methods might be useful for understanding other cultures or that non-Western cultures might use Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Choice D suggests that Western scientific investigations are important for understanding Western culture, which could support the use of these methods in understanding other cultures as well.
  Choices A, B, C, and E do not directly address the use of Western scientific methods.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education is in choice D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The second version of multicultural education advocates for adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and using Western scientific methods to study and understand other cultures.
  Critics of this version argue that Western scientific methods are value-laden and are an attempt to maintain Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Thought:
  The passage's criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first version.
  The criticism is based on the idea that Western scientific methods are value-laden, so using them to study non-Western cultures is distorting.
  To provide a strong objection to this criticism, we need to show that Western scientific methods can be used to study another culture without distorting its value system.
  Therefore, we need to look for an answer choice that shows that adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures is not distorting.
Evaluation:
  A: This answer choice does not provide a strong objection. It actually supports the criticism in the passage by suggesting that adopting a culture's perspective is impossible.
  B: This answer choice is irrelevant to the criticism in the passage. It does not address the use of Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  C: This answer choice is somewhat relevant, but it does not provide a strong objection. It suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system, but it does not show how this can be used to successfully study another culture.
  D: This answer choice is not relevant to the criticism in the passage. It discusses the need for Western scientific investigations of Western achievements, which is not related to the use of Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  E: This answer choice is also not relevant to the criticism in the passage. It discusses the importance of understanding another culture but does not address the use of Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education to achieve multicultural understanding.
  The first proposal holds that students should learn about other cultures with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture of liberal democracy. 
  The second version of multicultural education adopts a neutral stance with respect to cultural differences and techniques of Western scholarship to understand other cultures. 
  Critics of the second version argue that the study of non-Western cultures by Western scientific methods is a form of cultural chauvinism because Western science is value-laden. 
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it imposes Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures.
  To refute this criticism, we need to argue that it is not a form of cultural chauvinism to impose Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures.
  Option A is irrelevant since the passage does not suggest that non-members cannot understand other cultures.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the argument being made.
  Option C, while suggesting that non-Western societies use their own value system when studying other cultures, does not refute the criticism that the second version of multicultural education is culturally chauvinistic.
  Options D and E are both plausible ways of defending the second version of multicultural education. The first states that Western scientific methods are necessary to appreciate the achievements of Western cultures, while the second suggests that there is value in learning about and understanding other cultures.
Criticism: 
  Option D is irrelevant because it speaks about the understanding of Western cultures rather than non-Western cultures.
  Option E provides a weak defense of the second version of multicultural education, as it suggests that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, but it does not directly discredit the criticism that the use of Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures is culturally chauvinistic.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains the two versions of multicultural education: the first promotes understanding of other cultures through teachings based on the values of the majority culture, while the second one holds that each culture should be studied on its own terms without judging it based on the values of other cultures.
  The criticism of the second version argues that the methods of examining cultures and promoting understanding are still those of Western scientific heritage and that it is impossible to truly understand another culture using scientific methods without distorting it.
Thought:
  The objection to the second version of multicultural education is that it is based on Western scientific methods that are value-laden and do not allow for a true understanding of non-Western cultures. Therefore, an argument that counters this objection must show that the Western scientific methods used in the second version are not value-laden and can provide a true understanding of non-Western cultures. 
A: This statement may be true, but it does not provide counter-evidence to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education in the passage.
B: This statement may be true, but it does not provide counter-evidence to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education in the passage.
C: This statement suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system for studying cultures that have different values. It does not provide evidence that the Western scientific methods used in the second version of multicultural education are not value-laden, or that they can provide a true understanding of non-Western cultures.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education in the passage.
E: This statement supports the criticism of the second version of multicultural education in the passage that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for appropriately appreciating that culture when using scientific methods.
 
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are two versions of multicultural education proposed.
  The first version claims that students should learn about other cultures, while examination of these cultures should proceed with the values of the majority culture.
  The second version claims that we should adopt a neutral stance with respect to different value systems among cultures.
  Critics argue that the second version is not essentially different from the first because they use the methods and perspectives of Western science.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education states that Western scientific perspectives cannot provide the real understanding of other cultures.
  To objection this criticism, we need to provide evidence that adopting a neutral stance and using Western scientific methods can provide genuine understanding.
  Option E does not object to the criticism of the second version, but rather supports its critics by stating that real understanding is necessary for appreciating another culture.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B merely points out that some non-Western societies share similar values, which does not object to the criticism of the second version.
  Option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their value systems to study other cultures, but this still does not object to the criticism of the second version.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  None of the options provide evidence to object to the criticism of the second version.
Criticism: 
  I am confident that my answer is correct.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first proposal teaches about other cultures using the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture.
  The second proposal adopts a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that adopting Western scientific methods is not different from the first proposal.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second proposal is that adopting Western scientific methods is an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  To refute this criticism, we need to find a statement that shows Western scientific methods are not value-laden and offers an alternative perspective.
  A: This statement weakens the second proposal, as it suggests that adopting the perspectives of another culture is impossible.
  B: This statement is irrelevant, as it does not address the criticism of the second proposal.
  C: This statement suggests that non-Western cultures can study other cultures while using their own values, but it does not address the criticism that Western scientific methods are not value-laden and may distort non-Western cultures.
  D: This statement is also unrelated to the criticism of the second proposal, as it is discussing the study of Western achievements rather than the study of other cultures.
  E: This statement supports the idea that understanding other cultures is necessary for appreciation, but it does not address the criticism of the second proposal that the Western scientific method is not culturally neutral.
Criticism:

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the music of Arnold Schoenberg and the way that it altered traditional music. 
  This alteration made the music difficult to follow, but also allowed for the expression of new and uncharted emotional states in music.
Thought:
  The passage acknowledges that Schoenberg's music is disturbing but ultimately valuable because it expresses important emotional states.
  The other choices all describe ways that a comedian might be disturbing, but none of them are directly analogous to the way in which Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  Answer B is the closest fit because it describes a comedian whose humor illuminates difficult but important aspects of human nature. 
Criticism:
  The question asks for something that is "most analogous" to the way in which Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing. 
  Answer B is moderately similar, but it does not fully capture all of the nuances of the comparison.
  The passage suggests that Schoenberg's music is difficult to follow but ultimately valuable despite this difficulty.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses Schoenberg's music and why it can be seen as disturbing. Schoenberg's music precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. The passage does not discuss any other form of art or entertainment beyond music and Schoenberg's work. 
Thought: The passage discusses how Schoenberg's music is disturbing in that it unflinchingly faces difficult truths. Therefore, to find something that is most analogous to Schoenberg's music, we should look for an example in which a piece of art or entertainment unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
A: This choice does not address any difficult truths but instead relies on vulgar humor, which is not analogous to Schoenberg's work.
B: This choice fits with the idea of facing difficult truths and is therefore most analogous to Schoenberg's music.
C: This choice doesn't seem analogous to Schoenberg's work. Even though the comedian's material is already famous, this is different than facing a difficult truth. 
D: This choice doesn't seem to fit, as it doesn't address a difficult truth but instead refers to an extreme political philosophy. 
E: This choice isn't analogous to the passage's discussion of how Schoenberg's work is disturbing because of the difficult truths it portrays. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the work of Arnold Schoenberg and how he brought a new system of order to non-tonal music through his 12-tone technique. It then argues that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. 
Thought: Since the question is asking for a comparison to Schoenberg's music being disturbing in a specific way, we should look for an option that also presents an argument about something being disturbing in a certain way. Option B is the only one that suggests that the disturbing aspect is an unflinching gaze on difficult truths. The other options are either about offensive material or genres that the audience is unfamiliar with. Therefore, option B seems to be the best answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the evolution of Arnold Schoenberg's music.
  Schoenberg precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
Thought:
  Arnold Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths and delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Based on that, we can think about the choices for this question.
  A: The comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor could be considered disturbing for some people, but the reason for that is different from the reason for Schoenberg's music being disturbing.
  B: A comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore might be considered disturbing in a way that is similar to Schoenberg's music because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
  C: A comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians is not disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is.
  D: A comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy is not disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is.
  E: A comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience is not disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is.
  Therefore, the most analogous disturbing scenario to Schoenberg's music is option B. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the controversial nature of the music of Arnold Schoenberg and how it altered musical language and expression.
  The passage also notes that Schoenberg's work accurately reflects emotional states that had not previously been recorded in music.
Thought: 
  The question asks for something that is analogous to the disturbing nature of Schoenberg's music.
  Schoenberg's music accurately reflects difficult emotional states not previously recorded.
  Something that reflects difficult emotional states that have not been previously addressed could be an analogous comparison to Schoenberg's music.
  Out of the given choices, the comedian whose humor sheds a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, could be an analogous comparison to Schoenberg's music.
  The answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Criticism: 
  The question asks for something that is analogous to the disturbing nature of Schoenberg's music.
  While the answer choice B certainly reflects emotional states that have not been previously recorded, it is not clear if those emotional states are actually disturbing.
  It is possible that another answer choice might also be a plausible answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how Schoenberg's music is considered disturbing because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
Thought: 
  If Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it presents recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that have not been recorded before, then any type of art that does the same could be considered equally disturbing. 
  B: A comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, could be similarly disturbing because it presents a new perspective on human behavior that might make people uncomfortable.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Criticism: 
  There might be other types of art, outside of comedy, that could also present recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that have not been recorded before.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the ways in which Arnold Schoenberg extended the expressive range of music and charted new territory in its language. 
  The passage notes that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because of the emotional states it precisely delineates and records.
Thought:
  Not all forms of disturbing art are alike.
  Schoenberg's music is disturbing because of the emotional states it records.
  If a work of art were to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to Schoenberg's music, it would likely be a work of art that precisely delineates recognizably difficult or disquieting emotional states.
  Among the answer choices, the answer that fits this description best is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Criticism:
  Nothing in the passage explicitly supports this inference.
  The comparison between a comedian and a musician might not be apt, as they work in different mediums.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage discusses Arnold Schoenberg's music and how it evolved over his career. The author argues that Schoenberg's music is important because it expresses emotions in new and innovative ways. Some of Schoenberg's music remains disturbing because it faces difficult truths.
Thought: The passage suggests that what makes Schoenberg's music disturbing is not its technical complexity, but its ability to express difficult emotions. Therefore, the most analogous example of something else that is disturbing would also be something that expresses difficult truths or emotions. 
  A: vulgar humor is not generally associated with expressing difficult emotions or truths. 
  B: This answer is consistent with the idea that Schoenberg's music is important because it expresses emotions in new ways, and some of his work remains disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths. 
  C: a comedian reusing old material is not necessarily disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music can be. 
  D: while extreme politics can be disturbing, the passage does not suggest that this is a parallel to Schoenberg's music. 
  E: unfamiliar style of humor is not clearly related to the idea of expressing difficult emotions or truths. 
Criticism: It could be argued that the passage does not provide enough detail to definitively link what makes Schoenberg's music disturbing to the type of humor that would be most analogous.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage discusses Arnold Schoenberg's music and its evolution. It notes that his music became more condensed, violent in its contrasts, and more difficult to follow. The author argues that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that it precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
Thought: The author notes that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths. Therefore, the choice that is most analogous to Schoenberg's music is one that faces difficult truths, or shines a light on aspects of human nature that many people would prefer to ignore.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage discusses Arnold Schoenberg and his evolution of three different musical styles. The author argues that despite the fact that Schoenberg's music was difficult to follow, it was essential because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. 
Thought: The question asks for which of the following is "most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing." This means we need to consider which option presents something that "precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that [art form] had not recorded before." 
A: This option suggests that vulgar humor is disturbing but does not suggest that the comedian is delineating anything new or particularly emotional.
B: This option suggests that a comedian shining a light on aspects of human nature that people would prefer to ignore could be disturbing and could be seen as delineating emotional states. However, it does not present the idea that these emotional states have not been recorded before.
C: This option does not suggest that the comedian is disturbing in the way that Schoenberg's music is.
D: This option suggests that a comedian expressing an extreme political philosophy could be seen as disturbing and presenting new emotional states. However, it does not suggest that the emotional states are "disquieting" or that the philosophy has not been recorded before.
E: This option suggests that a comedian with an unfamiliar style of humor could be disturbing but does not suggest that they are delineating new emotional states.
Therefore, option B is the best answer as it presents something that is disturbing and could be seen as delineating new emotional states that have not been recorded before.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposed forms of multicultural education.
  The first version of multicultural education holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture.
  The second version of multicultural education holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of both the first and second versions of multicultural education argue that attempting to understand other cultures solely from the perspective of the majority culture or through Western scientific methods is distorting and inadequate.
Thought: 
  The proponents of the second version of multicultural education argue that examining other cultures using Western scientific methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity, which they see as potentially distorting.
  Among the given options, choice C is most similar to this idea, as it describes a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
  Therefore, proponents of the second version of multicultural education would most likely consider this objectionable.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education. 
  The second version of multicultural education adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
  Critics of the second form of multicultural education argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded on an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective.
Thought: 
  The proponents of the second version of multicultural education would object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
  This is because the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective.
  Thus, the second version of multicultural education is criticized as an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, the answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The first version of multicultural education in the passage proposes that schools and colleges should teach about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture, with the values of the majority culture.
  The second version of multicultural education proposes a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and to take cultures on their own terms, but still employs Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures.
  Critics argue that these methods are already value-laden and are an expression of cultural chauvinism of science.
Thought:
  Proponents of the second version of multicultural education would object to:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies. However, there is no indication of such a study in the passage.
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires. This also does not seem objectionable to proponents of the second version of multicultural education.
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture. This seems to be most objectionable because it involves Western methods of examination of cultures when the critics argue that it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values. Although this study may involve examining the literature of other cultures, it is not objectified through the Western scientific heritage, so it is unlikely to be considered objectionable by proponents of the second version of multicultural education.
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture. Critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that these methods are already value-laden, so this choice does not seem objectionable either.
Therefore, the most likely answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are two main proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal promotes teaching about other cultures, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture.
  The second proposal holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that it is not essentially different from the first, because examination of cultures by the methods of Western science is already value laden.
Thought: 
  The proponents of the second proposal hold that multicultural education should not privilege one culture's values over another.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that examining other cultures by Western scientific methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity; thus, the second proposal is not essentially different from the first.
  The objectionable study is one that uses Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct based on the information provided in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education that promote understanding of other cultures.
  The first version promotes understanding through teaching about other cultures using the values of the majority culture.
  The second version promotes understanding through a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures but still uses the methods of Western social sciences.
  Critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that these methods are value-laden and cannot lead to real understanding of non-Western cultures.
Thought:
  Proponents of the second version of multicultural education object to the methods of Western social sciences for understanding non-scientific cultures.
  Choice (C) is objectionable because it employs Western science to investigate a non-scientific culture, going against the approach of the second version of multicultural education.
  Therefore, choice (C) is the most likely answer.
Criticism:
  This is a valid analysis given the information in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses different proposals for implementing multicultural education.
  The first proposal advocates for teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture.
  The second proposal advocates for a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still using Western methods of examination, study, and explanation.
  Critics argue that both proposals are inadequate for understanding other cultures adequately.
Thought:
  The third paragraph describes objections to the second proposal for using Western methods of examination to understand non-Western cultures.
  Therefore, the answer choice that would be most objectionable to proponents of the second proposal would likely involve using Western methods of study to understand non-Western cultures.
  choice A discusses studying the differences between moral codes which could potentially involve non-Western cultures but does not necessarily invoke Western methods of study. Hence this is less likely the correct answer.
  Choice B discusses a literary study within a culture, which is outside the scope of an examination of other culture and hence is unlikely the correct answer.
  Choice D discusses the use of one society's literary theories to criticize another society's literature which is also outside the scope of understanding other cultures. Hence this is unlikely to be the correct answer.
  Choice E discusses critics using Western methods to criticize Western culture, which is not related to understanding other cultures. Hence this is unlikely to be the correct answer.
  Choice C discusses a study that employs Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture is highly likely to be the correct answer as it is directly relevant to understanding other cultures using Western scientific methods.
Conclusion:
   The answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education. 
  The first version holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. 
  The second version of multicultural education holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures, but the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
  Critics of these two versions argue that the Western scientific heritage and epistemological system prize the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical, leading to an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. 
Thought:
  The proponents of the second version of multicultural education believe that each culture should be taken on its own terms, and the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this version are still identifiably Western. 
  The passage suggests that the Western scientific system is value-laden and distorts other cultures, so using these methods to investigate a nonscientific culture would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the second version of multicultural education. 
  Thus, C is the most likely answer.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education. 
  The first version advocates for teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture's values (typically liberal democratic values).
  The critics of this version argue that this approach is insufficient and that genuine understanding requires considering the perspectives of the cultures being studied.
  The second version of multicultural education holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms, without judging it by other standards. However, the methods used to study other cultures (such as anthropology and sociology) are still Western, which some critics argue distorts the understanding of non-Western cultures.
Thought: 
  The proponents of the second version of multicultural education are critical of using Western scientific methods to study non-scientific cultures. 
  Choice C suggests using the methods of Western science to investigate a non-scientific culture.
  Therefore, choice C would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the second version of multicultural education.
  The answer is C.
Criticism: 
  Your interpretation of the passage is accurate. 
  However, proponents of the second version of multicultural education do not object to using Western scientific methods in general, but rather to using them exclusively to study non-Western cultures. They argue that using diverse perspectives and methods is necessary for genuine understanding.
  So, while choice C might be objectionable, it is not the only possible objectionable choice based on the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes two versions of multicultural education that have been proposed.
  The first version of multicultural education suggests that schools should teach about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture.
  The second version of multicultural education suggests that schools should adopt a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures and that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures should still be Western.
  Critics of the second version argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes certain values, such as objectivity, and that studying other cultures through these methods involves a commitment to these values. 
  According to these critics, attempting to understand non-scientific cultures through Western scientific methods is distorting and an expression of cultural chauvinism.
Thought: 
  Proponents of the second version of multicultural education argue that schools should take a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures.
  Critics of this second version of multicultural education argue that the methods of social-scientific examination are already value-laden and that understanding other cultures through Western scientific methods is distorting and an expression of cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture is most likely to be considered objectionable by proponents of the second version of multicultural education.
  The answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism: 
  There might be other studies that proponents of the second version of multicultural education would consider objectionable; for example, a study that takes a critical stance towards a non-Western culture could also be considered objectionable.
  However, the passage does not provide information about this, so it is reasonable to select C as the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal is to teach about other cultures while using the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture.
  The second proposal is to take a neutral stance on the value differences among cultures, but still use Western social-science methods to study other cultures.
  Critics of both proposals argue that they are flawed because they distort the perspectives and value systems of non-Western cultures.
Thought:
  The question asks which study would be considered objectionable by proponents of the third proposal for multicultural education.
  The third proposal is to use the perspectives and methods of the culture being studied to achieve a better understanding.
  Choice A does not involve the perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied.
  Choice B is focused on understanding the personal characteristics that particular cultures admire and can be viewed as an attempt to use the perspectives of those different cultures.
  Choice C is objectionable because it would entail using Western scientific methods to investigate nonscientific cultures, contrary to the third proposal.
  Choice D is objectionable because it would involve applying the literary theories of one society onto a literature that has different values and can be viewed as an attempt to pour foreign values into another culture.
  Finally, Choice E is not objective to the third proposal, as it does not use the perspective and methods of the culture being studied.
  Therefore, the most objectionable study for proponents of the third proposal would be C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.
  D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  E: "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed someone not from the Border region.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The passage explains that corridos are a type of narrative folk song that come from the border region between Mexico and the United States.
- The narratives of corridos are specific to the Border region.
- Corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments.
- Corridos use familiar linguistic and thematic conventions to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities.
- The passages explains that the corridos have certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another, especially in the formal closing verse.
Thought:
- Since the passage explains how corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings and affirm cohesiveness of Border communities, it is unlikely that "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings. 
- The passage mentions the oldest corrido surviving in complete form and how corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, suggesting that most surviving corridos do exist in complete form.
- The passage supports the idea that corridos have certain lines in common, suggesting that C: All complete corridos have some lines in common is the most plausible answer.
- The passage explains that the formal closing verse of a corrido has certain conventions, which might vary in the second and fourth line, suggesting that D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida is not the best answer choice.
- "El Corrido de Kiansis," which records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s, is part of the long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain, suggesting that it was composed by someone from the Border region. 
Criticism:
- There is no information in the passage to support the idea of the rarity of "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" at Border social gatherings, so Answer(A) is not correct.
- The passage does not provide any information on the majority of corridos not existing in complete form, or Answer (B), this makes it the least plausible answer choice.
- The passage suggests that corridos share certain conventions in the closing verse, but may vary in the second and fourth line, so answer choice D is not supported.
- Answer choice E is not correct as the author explains that corridos, in general, come from the border region and that they have roots in Spain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Corridos are narrative folk songs that have roots in eighteenth-century Spain.
  - Corridos flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s.
  - Corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs.
  - Corridos narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region.
  - Corridos affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities.
  - The term corrido comes from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow.
  - Corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishment.
  - The despedida is the formal closing verse of a corrido.
Thought:
  The passage describes the corrido as a narrative folk song that tells a story and embodies the culture of the Border region. The despedida, the formal closing verse, is the only part of the corrido with a set convention. It can be inferred that this section of the corrido, which varies based on subject matter and needs of rhyme, marks the completion of the tale. Therefore, it is most reasonable to conclude that all complete corridos have some lines in common. 
  Option A is not supported in the passage.
  Option B is mentioned in the passage; the oldest corrido surviving is not a complete form.
  Option C is supported by the passage; the despedida is the only section of a corrido with a fixed set of lines.
  Option D is strongly supported by the passage; the despedida is the only section of a corrido with a set convention.
  Option E is not mentioned in the passage.
  
  Therefore, the best answer is D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida. 
Criticism:
  There is no convincing evidence in the passage that suggests that most corrido variants have the same despedida. While the passage explains that the despedida follows a set convention, it does not state how frequently those conventions repeated across many corridos. Option C is correct since the passage clarifies that the corrido is a familiar form with standard elements, such as the despedida. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about corridos, a type of narrative folk song, that comes from the Lower Rio Grande Border.
  The corrido tradition has its roots in an eighteenth-century ballad tradition in Spain.
  Corridos tell stories about Border region subjects and events.
  Corridos are sung in Spanish and quickly, without using metaphors.
  The formal closing verse of the corrido has a set convention of the first and third lines, and the second and fourth lines are variables.
Thought:
  The passage mentions that corridos are sung at social gatherings to commemorate significant events in Border communities.
  The passage also states that the corrido has a set formal closing verse with an identical first and third line.
  The first and third lines are a set convention of the corrido, so all corridos have the same first and third lines in the formal closing verse, and the others are variable.
  Therefore, C: All complete corridos have some lines in common is the correct inference.
Criticism:
  There is no mention or evidence that "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings or that "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed by someone not from the Border region.
  The passage also does not specify whether most surviving corridos do or do not exist in complete form.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage provides information about corridos, a type of narrative folk song from the Lower Rio Grande Border region.
  Corridos have been part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain.

  Corridos commemorate significant local happenings and their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions serves to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities.
  Corridos use familiar images and ready-made lines and often incorporate storm imagery. 
Thought: 
  The passage describes the importance of corridos to Border communities and the conventions of the form, including the use of familiar images and ready-made lines, and the prevalence of storm imagery. 
  The author notes that different versions of the same corrido often partake of standard generic elements.
  The passage provides an example of the fixed lines that are part of the corrido's formal closing verse, the despedida, which confirms and strengthens the corrido tradition over time.
  Therefore, the most plausible inference is that all complete corridos have some lines in common. 
  The answer is C.
Criticism: 
  There is no support in the passage for A, B, D, or E. 
  The passage provides a great deal of information about the structure and conventions of corridos, but does not address the frequency with which any particular songs were sung or the origins of specific corridos. 
  The text mostly discusses the importance of corridos to Border communities and the features that are common to the form. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses corridos, a type of narrative folk song originating from the Lower Rio Grande Border region between Mexico and the United States.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage is about prions - a type of protein pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. Prions are different from other pathogens as they lack nucleic acid for reproduction, do not produce immune responses in the body, and occur naturally in the body as proteins. CJD is inevitably fatal, and there are no effective therapies. The exact mechanism of prion reproduction and cause of cellular destruction is not yet fully understood. 
Thought: 
- It is stated in the passage that "Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.", so choice C is likely to be agreed by the author.
- The passage mentions that CJD is inevitably fatal, so choice B is unlikely to be agreed by the author.
- The passage mentions that "the body does not produce an immune response when they are present", so choice D is likely to be agreed by the author.
- The passage does not state anything about patients with CJD recovering from the disease, so choice B is not supported or refuted by the passage.
- The passage discusses the mechanism of prion reproduction and cause of cellular destruction being not yet fully understood, so choice E is likely to be agreed by the author.
- The passage discusses the abnormal shape of prions being associated with neurological diseases, so choice A is likely to be agreed by the author.
Therefore, the author would be LEAST likely to agree with choice B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, caused by prions, which are infectious agents devoid of nucleic acid and composed mainly of protein. 
  - The disease is fatal and the body does not produce an immune response to prions.
Thought:
  - The author describes prions as being "infectious" and deadly, therefore, it is unlikely that they would agree that a patient with CJD will recover.
  - The author discusses at length the discovery that prions do not require nucleic acid for reproduction, indicating that they are likely to agree with this point.
  - The author also notes that the body does not produce an immune response to prions, so they would likely agree with the statement that the body has no natural defense against CJD.
  - The author acknowledges that there are still aspects of the mechanism by which prions reproduce that are not yet fully understood, so they would likely agree with the statement that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism of prion reproduction.
  - Thus, the statement the author would be LEAST likely to agree with is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism:
  - The text suggests that CJD is inevitably fatal, so it is unlikely that anyone infected with the disease would recover.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions, a new type of pathogen consisting mainly of protein and lacking nucleic acid.
  Prions convert normally shaped prions into the abnormal pathogenic conformation, leading to the destruction of nerve cells in the brain.
  CJD is inevitably fatal, and there is no effective therapy for preventing the reproduction of affected prions.
Thought:
  The author emphasizes the devastating effect of prions on the brain and notes that CJD is inevitably fatal with no effective therapy for the reproduction of affected prions.
  The passage mentions that prions are a new type of pathogen consisting mainly of protein and lacking nucleic acid.
  The passage does not mention any possibility that patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that B is the least likely answer choice to be agreed with by the author.
Criticism:
  There is no explicit discussion in the passage that patients currently infected with CJD will not recover from the disease.
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, but it does not exclude the possibility that some patients may recover from the disease.
  Therefore, it is not entirely accurate to say that B is the least likely answer choice to be agreed with by the author.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen responsible for causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a fatal degenerative neurological disorder.
  CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge.
  Prions are capable of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape; this produces a plaque that collects in the brain and destroys nerve cells, ultimately leading to death.
  Because prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
Thought:
  The author of the passage recognizes that CJD is a deadly neurological disorder caused by prions that reproduce in a way that is fundamentally different from other pathogens.
  The author provides evidence to support the affirmation that prions do not require nucleic acid to reproduce, and that they are capable of causing cell destruction by transforming normal proteins.
  The author also presents evidence that prions are not identified by the body as foreign, therefore the body does not produce an immune response to eliminate them.
  It is unlikely that the author would agree with B: some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease, because the text clearly states the disease is inevitably fatal, though there are variations in the course it takes.
  The passage does not provide support to agree or disagree with the other choices.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a degenerative form of dementia in humans in which the brain becomes riddled with tiny holes and destroys nerve cells. 
  The cause of CJD was previously thought to be one of the traditional pathogens: viruses, bacteria, fungus, and parasites which require nucleic acid for reproduction and regulate their functions via genetic material composed of nucleic acid. 
  However, it was later discovered that a pathogen called prion, which contains no nucleic acid, is responsible for CJD.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in the body's white blood and nerve cells but possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape that produces a plaque of thread-like structures in the brain.
Thought: 
  The author would be least likely to agree with a statement that contradicts information provided in the passage. 
  A: It is stated in the passage that the presence of abnormally shaped prions in the brain tissue results in disease and, therefore, information provided in option A is not contradicted by the passage.
  B: There is no indication in the passage that patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease. On the contrary, it is stated in the passage that CJD is inevitably fatal.
  C: The passage states that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction, and therefore, information provided in option C is not contradicted by the passage.
  D: The passage states that the body has no natural defense against CJD, and therefore, information provided in option D is not contradicted by the passage.
  E: The passage states that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce, and therefore, information provided in option E is not contradicted by the passage.
  Option B contradicts the information provided in the passage that CJD is inevitably fatal, and therefore the author is least likely to agree with option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
The passage explains Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a type of degenerative neurological disease in humans. It discusses the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called a prion, which unlike other pathogens, does not contain nucleic acid. The prion is capable of transforming from a harmless protein to a pathogenic protein that is capable of reproducing itself in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction. The infected prions could ultimately destroy nerve cells and tissues leading to CJD. The passage also states that the exact mechanism by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction is not yet fully understood.
Thought: 
Option A: The passage certainly supports this statement.
Option B: This contradicts the passage. The author has specifically mentioned that CJD is inevitably fatal. Therefore the author would not agree with this statement.
Option C: The passage states that the prions discovered as a result of research seeking to identify the pathogen responsible for CJD lack nucleic acids. Therefore, this statement is true, and the author would agree with it.
Option D: The author supports this idea. The passage mentions that unlike other pathogens, the prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, enabling them to bypass the body's immune system and making the body incapable of producing an immune response when they are present. Therefore, the author would most likely agree with this option.
Option E: The passage states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood. Therefore, this statement is true, and the author would agree with it.
Criticism:
There is nothing wrong with the evaluation and thought process.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - CJD is caused by a pathogen called a prion.
  - Prions are a type of protein pathogen that lack nucleic acid in their cellular structure.
  - Prions exist naturally in the body as proteins in many different tissues, but they can convert into a dangerous abnormal shape that reproduces itself by inducing other prions to transform.
  - The body doesn't produce an immune response to prions.
  - CJD is fatal and there is currently no effective therapy to prevent it.
Thought:
  - The author would be least likely to agree with a statement that contradicts or undermines the information given in the passage.
  - A: The passage clearly states that the abnormal shape of prions in the brain tissue creates a plaque that destroys nerve cells and causes neurological disease. This statement is supported by the passage, so it's not the correct option.
  - B: The passage states that CJD is fatal and currently has no effective therapy to prevent it. Therefore, it's unlikely the author would agree with this statement, which implies that some patients recover.
  - C: This is a statement supported by the passage--prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction. Therefore, the author would likely agree with this statement, and it's not the correct option.
  - D: The passage states that the body does not produce an immune response to prions, and there is no effective therapy to prevent CJD, which is fatal. Therefore, it's unlikely the author would disagree with this statement and it's not the correct option.
  - E: This statement is similar to the idea that the mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves are not fully understood, which is supported by the passage. However, it's possible that the author would have a stronger opinion on this statement or would disagree with it completely. Therefore, this is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a degenerative form of dementia in humans that causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes.
  Prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues.
  Prions possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape.
  Prions can reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Unlike other pathogens, prions occur naturally in the body as proteins.
Thought:
  A: The passage describes extensively how prions, abnormally shaped proteins, can reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction in the brain leading to neurological disease. A is true.
  B: The passage never suggests that someone infected with CJD will recover from the disease. The passage explicitly states that CJD is inevitably fatal, thus B is false.
  C: The passage explains how prions can reproduce and their behavior as a pathogenic agent lacking nucleic acid. Therefore, C is true.
  D: The passage explains that unlike other pathogens, the body does not produce immune responses when prions are present and there is no effective therapy for preventing reproduction. Therefore, D is true.
  E: The passages state that researchers still have not completely understood the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction. Therefore, E is true.
  The least likely answer is B, which is false.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  It discusses prions as a new type of pathogen responsible for CJD.
  Prions do not contain nucleic acid.
  Prions are capable of reproducing themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  The body does not produce an immune response when prions are present.
Thought: 
  The author gives a detailed explanation of the mechanism by which prions reproduce and cause cellular destruction.
  The author points out that CJD is inevitably fatal with a wide variation in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
  Based on the author's discussion of CJD, it can be inferred that a patient currently infected with CJD is not likely to recover from the disease.
  The author discusses the new class of pathogen that prion belongs to and how it is capable of reproducing themselves without nucleic acid.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the author is least likely to agree with B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which is caused by a pathogen that is a protein, not containing nucleic acid.
  The pathogen responsible for CJD is called a prion.
  Prions exist as normal proteins in the body, but can convert into an abnormal shape that leads to the formation of plaques in the brain, destroying nerve cells and resulting in CJD.
Thought: 
  The passage states that CJD is a degenerative disease caused by prions, which are a new type of protein pathogen that do not contain nucleic acid. The author is least likely to agree with an answer that contradicts any of these facts.
  A: The passage indicates that the presence of abnormally shaped prions in the brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease in the form of CJD. Therefore, A is not the correct answer.
  B: The passage does not mention any possibility of recovery from CJD. Patients infected with CJD ultimately succumb to the disease, albeit with wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and how aggressively the disease progresses. Therefore, B is a possibility.
  C: The passage confirms that prions lack nucleic acid and reproduces themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normal prions to convert to the abnormal, pathogenic conformation in an unexpected way. Therefore, C is also not a correct answer.
  D: The passage states that prions, unlike traditional pathogens like viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, occur naturally in the body as proteins and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. Therefore, D could be a possible answer.
  E: The passage confirms that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood. Therefore, E is not the correct answer.
  Between the possible answers, B, D, and E, B is the least likely option because the passage does not mention the possibility of any patient with CJD recovering.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle, which suggests that individuals make rational economic choices by weighing the potential outcomes of different actions and choosing the one that maximizes their expected utility.
Thought:
  A: In this scenario, the waiter is making a rational economic choice by weighing the potential outcomes of his actions, although he is breaking the law.
  B: In this scenario, the motorist is making a rational economic choice by weighing the potential outcomes of her actions and choosing not to incur the cost of losing her driver's license.
  C: In this scenario, the industrialist is making a rational economic choice by weighing the costs of treating the pollutant against the potential fine and choosing the option that maximizes his expected utility, although he is breaking the law.
  D: In this scenario, the government official is making a rational economic choice by weighing the potential outcomes of her actions and choosing to solicit bribes as a means of survival.
  E: This scenario involves an impulsive crime and does not appear to involve any rational economic choice based on the expected utility of the action.
Therefore, the answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. 
Thought:
  A: A waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized. 
    This is an example of a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. The waiter is minimizing his tax payment because the costs of high taxes are greater than the benefits of paying taxes.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license. 
    This is an example of a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. The motorist is avoiding the cost of a speeding ticket that carries a penalty of a lost license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
    This is an example of a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. The industrialist is minimizing cost associated with treating the pollutant and weighing the costs of the fine for illegal discharges.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. 
    This is an example of a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. The official is committing the offence to support her and her family financially.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. 
    This is not an example of a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the worker is not motivated by costs or benefits, but rather by anger and emotions.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage provides an explanation of the utility maximization principle, which holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction in the face of both economic incentives and disincentives.
Thought:
  A: The waiter's decision to conceal tip income is based on an assessment of the probability of being caught and the severity of the fine.
  B: The motorist's behavior is influenced by the high likelihood of detection and the severe consequences of a speeding ticket.
  C: The industrialist's decision to continue to pollute is based on a cost-benefit analysis, comparing the cost of treatment to the cost of paying the fine.
  D: The government official's decision to solicit bribes is based on an assessment of the economic costs and potential benefits of this action.
  E: The worker's decision to assault his supervisor may be based on frustration, anger, and a sense of injustice, which do not necessarily involve rational economic calculation.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described response to economic incentives and disincentives would be E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Criticism:
  The economic framework, by itself, is not necessarily suited to analyze all types of criminal behavior. Rationality, as defined by utility maximization, may not be the only motivation for human action. Certain types of crimes may reflect extreme psychological states, intense emotions or a willingness to take risks not fully captured by rational utility calculations.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
Thought: 
  The question asks to identify the least appropriate rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  In each of the given situations, the characters respond to economic incentives or disincentives in a way that can be analyzed as rational from the perspective of the utility maximization principle.
  However, response (E) is different from others, as it involves an impulsive reaction to a personal event rather than a rationally calculated decision based on economic incentives and disincentives. 
Criticism: 
  The explanation provided in the passage defines rational individuals as those who choose actions to maximize their overall satisfaction. However, it is possible that individuals may act irrationally and choose actions that do not maximize their satisfaction. From this perspective, response (D) could also be considered an irrational response to economic incentives and disincentives, since an individual who risks prosecution for soliciting bribes is not necessarily acting rationally.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The economic principle of utility maximization holds that people make rational decisions depending on their expected utility.
  Expected utility is a calculation of the utilities of possible outcomes, weighted by the likelihood of each outcome occurring.
Thought: 
  A: The waiter anticipates a reward from concealing the tip income, and the fine for detection and punishment is low. This is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  B: The motorist anticipates punishment (loss of driver's license) for speeding, which would be very costly. This is a rational response to economic disincentives.
  C: The industrialist decides not to treat the untreated pollutant because treatment is very expensive, whereas the cost of the fine is low. This is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  D: The government official risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because she needs the additional money to support herself and her family. This is a rational response to economic incentives.
  E: The worker physically assaults his supervisor because he has been dismissed and believes the dismissal was unfair. There is no clear economic incentive or disincentive for this action.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains the utility maximization principle as the idea that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  A: A person concealing income to reduce taxes would be acting on the basis of anticipated overall satisfaction.
  B: A person avoiding speeding on a heavily patrolled road to preserve their license would be acting on the basis of anticipated overall satisfaction.
  C: A person disregarding pollution regulations would be acting on the basis of anticipated overall satisfaction.
  D: A person soliciting bribes to deal with inflation would be acting on the basis of anticipated overall satisfaction.
  E: A worker physically assaulting a supervisor would not be a rational response to economic incentives/disincentives. 
Thought:
  The passage suggests that rational individuals are driven by anticipated overall satisfaction when responding to economic incentives/disincentives.
  All of the choices except for E have individuals making rational decisions based on anticipated overall satisfaction.
  In E, the worker physically assaulting their former supervisor seems impulsive rather than a rational response to their situation.
  Therefore, E would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives/disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle as an economic framework for analyzing an individual's decision to commit a crime.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is one that seeks to maximize expected utility. That is, individuals will weigh the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action and choose the one that offers the greatest expected satisfaction.
  Option A describes a situation where a waiter conceals a part of his tip income to reduce his tax burden. While illegal, his behavior is a rational response to the economic incentive of reducing his tax liability. 
  Option B describes a motorist avoiding speeding on a heavily patrolled road to avoid losing her driver's license. This is another example of a rational response to an incentive.
  Option C describes an industrialist who decides to continue discharging untreated pollutants into a river because the cost of treatment exceeds the fine. This is also a rational response to an economic disincentive.
  Option D describes a government official who solicits bribes because her government salary is not enough to support her family. While unethical, her behavior is a rational response to the economic conditions she faces.
  In option E, a worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he was dismissed from his job and believes that it was unfair. This is not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives, but rather an impulsive response to a perceived provocation.
  Therefore, option E would be the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  The expected utility is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.

Thought:
  A: The waiter conceals a large part of his tip income to reduce his taxes because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized. This shows a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  B: The motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license. This shows a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  C: The industrialist illegally discharges an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant. This shows a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  D: The government official risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. This shows a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  E: The worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This does not show a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

Criticism:
  Option E is a description of an impulsive crime, not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. The worker's decision to assault his former supervisor is not based on a calculation of the expected utilities of possible outcomes.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage explains the utility maximization principle and argues that a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity.
A: In this scenario, the waiter is avoiding paying taxes to increase his overall income, which would be a rational response to an economic incentive.
B: In this scenario, the motorist is avoiding speeding to avoid losing her driving license, which would be a rational response to an economic disincentive.
C: In this scenario, the industrialist is continuing to pollute because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine, which would be a rational response to an economic disincentive.
D: In this scenario, the government official is soliciting for bribe due to rampant inflation, which is making her salary inadequate to support her and her family, and hence, is a rational response to an economic incentive.
E: In this scenario, the worker is physically assaulting his former supervisor, which would not be a rational response to an economic incentive or disincentive.

Thought: 
The passage describes the rational response to economic incentives or disincentives, and assaulting a former supervisor is not an economic response. Thus, the least appropriate response is E.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  According to the utility maximization principle, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The principle predicts that people will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
Thought:
  The question asks for the least appropriate response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  A: The waiter's response is rational since he tries to reduce his taxes by concealing his tip income since he believes that this action will not be detected.
  B: The motorist's response is rational since she avoids speeding because she knows it will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: The industrialist's response is rational since she discharges the pollutants because the cost of treating the pollutant far exceeds the fine.
  D: The government official's response is rational since she risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because her government salary is inadequate to support her and her family due to rampant inflation. 
  E: The worker's response of assaulting his former supervisor is impulsive and not based on economic incentives or disincentives.
  Therefore, E is the least appropriate response to economic incentives and disincentives.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.
  D: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
  E: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Schoenberg worked in three different musical styles throughout his career.
  He began in the late-Romantic manner, moved towards unstable harmonies without a tonal basis, and finally developed the 12-tone technique.
  He did this to advance music's historical development and express himself better.
Thought: 
  Each of the three musical styles represent an important phase of Schoenberg's development as a composer.
  He began in the late-Romantic manner present in his youth, and progressed to explore new approaches to music.
  The change towards atonal music was a natural progression as he was advancing the historical development of music.
  The 12-tone technique was a means of bringing order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that choice A is correct.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  He began with a late-Romantic style that was pervasive in his youth and later pushed the unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of stabilizing nontonal music. 
Thought: 
  The author describes the evolution of Schoenberg's musical styles as a transition from late-Romantic music to nontonal music and stabilizing it through the 12-tone technique. 
  The author further identifies the technical mastery that Schoenberg applied in all three styles that he used. 
  Based on the information presented, it can be inferred that the second and third styles represent a natural progression from the first style, given the evolution of Schoenberg's work in shifting chromatic harmonies towards pushing the boundaries and limits of tonal music and then fully moving into the realm of nontonal music. 
  Therefore, the author would agree with choice D: The second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second. 
Criticism: 
  It is possible that the author may view the progression between the three styles differently, but given the information presented, choice D seems to be the most accurate. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how Schoenberg's music evolved over time through three different styles.
Thought:
  The passage first describes Schoenberg's late-Romantic style with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  Next, it describes how Schoenberg pushed unstable harmonies further and further without a tonal basis. 
  Finally, the passage states that he developed the 12-tone technique to bring order to nontonal music.
  The author suggests that Schoenberg's progression from one style to the next is natural and it is necessary in order to express what he needed to.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence or clues in the passage to suggest that each successive style is inexplicable or inexplicable departures, which rules out options B, C, and D.
  Option E indicates that the third style represents a natural progression from the first, which is not mentioned in the passage. While this may or may not be true, the passage only discusses how the second and third styles relate to one another rather than how they relate to the first style.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style was the late-Romantic manner with music based on shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style was more atonal, without a tonal basis.
  The third style utilized the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
Thought: 
  The author states that Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery in all three styles.
  The author also notes that in the second and third styles, Schoenberg's music became more difficult to follow and more violent in its contrasts.
  However, the author emphasizes that the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the author views the relationships between the three styles as a natural progression that allowed Schoenberg to more precisely delineate recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  A natural progression from the first style to the second and then to the third style would align with this view.
  Option A best represents this view.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes three different musical styles through which Schoenberg evolved.
  The first style was late-Romantic, charged with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style pushed unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  The third style developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Schoenberg's three musical styles each evolved naturally from the previous one.
  The first style was late-Romantic, and the second style can be seen as a progression from the first, as it pushed unstable harmonies to their limits.
  The third style brought a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilized it, which can be seen as a natural progression from the second style.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement E: "The second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first."
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Schoenberg is known for having worked in three different musical styles.
  His first musical style was late-Romantic.
  He later pushed unstable harmonies until they were no longer tonal.
  He developed the 12-tone technique.
Thought: 
  The passage states that Schoenberg worked in three different musical styles.
  The passage characterizes the first style as late-Romantic.
  The second style shifted unstable harmonies until they were no longer tonal.
  The third style brought order to nontonal music.
  The author emphasizes Schoenberg's technical and emotional mastery.
  The author also calls Schoenberg's music essential.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with statement E: The second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.
Criticism: 
  It is possible that the author may disagree with this statement, but based on the context provided in the passage, it is the most likely statement the author would agree with.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage describes the three different styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved: (1) late-Romantic manner music with chromatic harmonies; (2) unstable harmonies with no tonal basis; (3) a 12-tone technique to bring order to nontonal music.
Thought: The author argues that Schoenberg's music is essential because it precisely delineates recognizable and disquieting emotional states, and that Schoenberg was a man of destiny who pushed the historical development of music. The passage describes how Schoenberg's music evolved in three different styles, but does not present them as inexplicable departures from each other. Instead, the author suggests that Schoenberg's music evolved naturally and necessarily. Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with option A, that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  Schoenberg began in the late-Romantic manner and later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  He developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
Thought: 
  According to the passage, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. 
  The passage mentions that Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery in all three styles.
  The passage also notes that his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow as his career progressed, but what makes his music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would most likely agree with the statement that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  Thus, the answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Criticism: 
  I don't see any flaws in the logic and reasoning used to arrive at the answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the three styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style was late-Romantic music with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  The third style was the 12-tone technique.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that Schoenberg began with a late-Romantic style that transformed into music that was no longer tonal and unstable. Later on, he developed the 12-tone technique to create a new system of order and stability. 
  This implies that the three styles represent a progression from the late-Romantic period to the development of the 12-tone technique. 
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The author notes that Schoenberg worked in three different musical styles.
  The first style was late-Romantic music, which is marked by shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style was non-tonal music, where the unstable harmonies did not have a tonal basis.
  Finally, the third style was based on the 12-tone technique, which was used to stabilize nontonal music by creating a new system of order.
Thought:
  The author believes that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Accordingly, it can be inferred that the author views Schoenberg's evolution as a natural progression towards recording new emotional states.
  Therefore, each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  Thus, the answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Criticism:
  There is no criticism for this answer.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the ways in which art has been historically "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The first way was for a member of the elite to commission a well-known artist to produce something for display to symbolize taste.
  The second way was for the elite to create or have created, a work that expressed and mirrored their ideals and way of life.
Thought:
  The main point of the passage is that there have been two distinct traditions in the production of art by the elites.The second way produced art that embodied the ideology of the dominant class, which is what sociohistorical critiques focus on.
  The first way was more concerned with the reputation that comes with commissioning art, and was not likely to produce art that endures.
  Talented artists sometimes operated on the margins of the establishment due to the values of the elite classes, which were not always conducive to producing good art.
  Some works that the elite classes opposed ended up enduring, making it necessary for sociohistorical critics to engage in detailed analyses to argue that the art was embodying the ideals of the elites in subtle ways.
  
Therefore, the answer is E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two ways that art historically originated from political and social elites.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is to present and clarify two distinct ways that political and social elites have commissioned art in the past. The passage also explains the challenges of analyzing art produced by elites, but does not necessarily argue that sociohistorical interpretations of art are overly simplistic. Additionally, the passage does not focus on the motives of patrons for commissioning art nor claim that such motives are driven purely by a desire for reputation. Instead, the passage primarily deals with the challenges of analyzing art produced by elites and the way in which sociohistorical critics approach such analysis. 
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses different ways art was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The sociohistorical interpretation of art views it as a reflection of the dominant or governing class's ideals.
  Historically, the two classes that commissioned art were the aristocratic or governing class and the well-to-do middle class.
  The taste of these classes were not always apt to produce enduring art.
Thought: 
  The passage presents an exploration of how art was commissioned and understood historically by different classes of people.
  It discusses the ways in which members of the elite commissioned art and how the dominant class's ideals are reflected in art.
  It raises questions about the accuracy of sociohistorical interpretations of art, which seek to analyze the way art embodies the ideology of the elite.
  It suggests that artists sometimes subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons, and that some of the enduring art produced went against the grain of elite values.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that there have historically been different ways in which members of the elite classes have commissioned art, and that sociohistorical interpretations of art reflect only one of those ways.
  Option E best expresses the main point of the passage.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the historical production of art and the ways in which it was commissioned and created by members of the elite classes.
  The passage also discusses the difficulties inherent in analyzing the ideologies embodied by art produced for these classes, as well as the fact that artists sometimes subverted the ideals and intentions of their patrons.
Thought:
  The passage focuses primarily on the historical production and analysis of art created for members of the elite classes in two distinct ways.
  It also discusses the difficulties in analyzing the ideologies embodied in such art, as well as the subversion of artistic intentions by individual artists.
  The main point of the passage is that the production and analysis of art by members of the elite classes is a complex and difficult process.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses the historical production of art by the elite classes and the ways in which they commissioned and valued art. The author also critiques sociohistorical interpretations that claim art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes. They argue that historical social classes commissioned art for different reasons, and that the tastes of the elite classes sometimes were not apt to produce art that endures.
Thought: 
The main point of the passage seems to be that while sociohistorical interpretations claim that art embodies the values of the elite, this is an overly simplistic view that ignores the complicated relationship between artists and patrons. The author argues that there are two distinct ways in which members of the elite commissioned art, and that the tastes of the elite could be unpredictable and not always produce enduring art. The author's critique of sociohistorical interpretations suggests that we need a more nuanced view of the relationship between art and the elite class.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses different ways historically in which art was produced for the political and social elite.
  It also mentions that the taste of the aristocracy and upper middle class was not always apt to produce enduring art.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is that there have been historical differences in the ways that art was produced for the elites and that sociohistorical critics must engage in a subtle analysis of art produced for the elites to determine how it reflects their values and ideals.
  The passage also points out that the taste of the elites has not always produced enduring art.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Criticism: 
  The thought process and answer are correct based on the information in the passage. 
  However, the answer could be criticized for not including all of the relevant information in the passage, such as the fact that sociohistorical critics must engage in subtle analysis of art to determine how it reflects the values and ideals of the elites, or that the taste of the aristocracy and upper middle class has not always produced enduring art.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the historical production of art by the elite classes.
  The author distinguishes between two ways in which art was produced by the elite: commissioning a work and producing a work that reflects one's own ideals.
  The author argues that the sociohistorical interpretation of art produced by the elite is a complex issue that requires careful analysis.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage seems to be that the sociohistorical interpretation of art produced by the elite is a nuanced issue that requires careful analysis.
  The author discusses the two ways in which art was produced by the elite and argues that a simplistic view of art as a reflection of the ideals and values of the elite is inadequate.
  The author also discusses the problems with producing enduring art within the framework of the social classes that could commission art.
  Finally, the author argues that a more complex analysis is required to understand the relationship between art and the elite.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
Criticism: 
  This seems to be the right answer.
  The author discusses the limitations of simplistic views of the relationship between art and the elite and presents a more complex view of the issue.
  The answer accurately reflects the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

The main point of the passage is to criticize the sociohistorical interpretation of art as being overly simplistic. The passage argues that there were two distinct ways in which the elite had art produced for them, and therefore, it cannot be assumed that all art reflects their ideals and values. Moreover, the passage highlights that artists often subverted the ideals of their patrons and that some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. The passage cautions against making generalizations about the relationship between art and the elite, as it was often more complex and nuanced than is commonly thought. Thus, the best choice to express the main point of the passage is B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage is discussing various interpretations of how art was commissioned and how sociohistorical critics analyze it. The passage mentions that there are two different ways art was produced for political and social elites and that sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze the works produced the second way. The passage also notes that not all of the art produced for elites reflects their ideals, and often artists worked in the margins of society. Finally, the passage mentions that sociohistorical critics must engage in some form of analysis to assert that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.

Thought: The passage presents several points, but the main point seems to be that social and political elites commissioned art in different ways throughout history, and that not all the produced art reflects their ideals. Additionally, the passage highlights that artists often worked in the margins and produced art against the norms, yet some of this achieved remarkable status. Lastly, the passage emphasizes that sociohistorical critics have to employ some form of analysis to assert that works of art embody the ideals of the elite. 

Evaluation: A, B, C, and E only touch on one aspect of the multiple points discussed in the passage. D is more comprehensive as it recognizes that sociohistorical critics analyze art to justify the claim that it embodies the ideals of the elite. However, it doesn’t mention other main points in the passage related to the commissioning of art and the status of artists, so it is not the best answer.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  Scholars have focused on written life histories solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
  The scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history that were oral and served different cultural constructs.
Thought: 
  The question asks for the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The author criticizes the earlier scholarship by stating that the scholars have "overlooked" and "failed to address" traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history that were "markedly inclusive."
  The author is expressing a negative attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  The best choice is A: "failed to address" as it directly states the author's criticism of the earlier scholarship.
Criticism: 
  The other options may reflect the author's attitude toward aspects of Native American culture, but they do not answer the question being asked, which is about the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  Option E is close in that it talks about the European style of autobiography being "alien" to early Native American cultures, but it does not describe the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
  However, upon further reading, it is reasonable to see the author's positive attitude toward traditional Native American modes of autobiographical expression and communication.
  Nonetheless, the question specifically asks about the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship, which is negative insofar as it is described as limited and overlooking important aspects of Native American culture.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage critiques the existing scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  A: "failed to address" does convey a negative attitude, but it is not specific to the scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  B: "highly diverse" describes Native American peoples but is not directly related to the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
  C: "markedly inclusive" is used to describe the idea of self in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures.
  D: "seemingly more fragmented" describes the mode of autobiography in certain Native American cultures, but it is not directly related to the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
  E: "alien to the European style" describes how the intercultural collaboration of Native American autobiography may seem to European style of autobiography, but it is not directly related to the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
Thought:
  The passage generally critiques earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The author points out that the scholars limited their study to a specific type of written document,
  and this overlooks traditional modes of communication and cultural constructs of the Native American peoples that shape the idea of autobiography.
  Therefore, it is likely that the author has a negative attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  The only answer choices that indicate a negative attitude are A and E.
  However, "failed to address" in A is not specific to the scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  Since E does describe European scholars' unfamiliarity with the Native American mode of autobiography, it may be a better choice.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that focused on written, as-told-to life histories. The scholars overlooked traditional, pre-literate modes of communicating personal history and failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples. The author also points out that pre-contact Native American cultures did not share the same assumptions about self, life, and writing as Europeans, and that the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events. The author describes various pre-literate modes of communication for personal history, including oral autobiography, dance, drama, tattoos, and tribal pageants.
Thought:
  The author discusses the limitations of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies because scholars overlooked traditional, pre-literate modes of communication and failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples.
  C: "markedly inclusive" represents the author's attitude toward the Native American cultures, not the earlier scholarship.
  D: "seemingly more fragmented" describes the pre-literate modes of communication, not the earlier scholarship.
  E: "alien to the European style" describes the intercultural collaboration during expression of life experiences, not the earlier scholarship.
  A: "failed to address" best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("A")

  This scholarship overlooks traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
Thought: 
  The author is discussing earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The author points out that this scholarship has focused on written life histories created by non-Native American collaborators which overlooks traditional modes of communicating personal history.
  The question asks for the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  Answer A: "failed to address" (line 9) - The author uses this phrase to describe the earlier scholarship but it does not reveal the author's attitude toward it.
  Answer B: "highly diverse" (line 10) - The author uses this phrase to describe Native American peoples but it does not reveal the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  Answer C: "markedly inclusive" (line 16) - This phrase is used to describe the idea of self in pre-contact Native American cultures and does not reveal the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  Answer D: "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24) - The author uses this phrase to describe traditional modes of communicating personal history and it implies that the earlier scholarship was limited in its scope and completeness.
  Answer E: "alien to the European style" (line 51) - The author uses this phrase to describe intercultural collaboration in Native American autobiographical expressions and does not reveal the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  The most suitable answer is D: "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24).
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The author is discussing the limitations of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that focused on written documents, as opposed to traditional oral modes of communicating personal history. The author argues that scholars have failed to consider the cultural constructs of pre-contact Native American cultures and the idea of self, which was inclusive of a society, specific landscape, and the cosmos. The author also notes that expression was not limited to writing but included language including speech and signs, songs, chants, and stories, dance and drama, tattoos, artifacts, and help from the tribe. 
Thought: 
  The question asks about the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage, so I need to identify what the author thinks or feels about the scholarship. The author points out that scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history and have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples. I interpret this as the author criticizing the earlier scholarship for missing important aspects of the study of Native American autobiographies. 
  A: "failed to address" implies that the earlier scholarship lacked something important, so it is a possible answer.
  B: "highly diverse" relates to the cultural constructs of Native American peoples, so it is not the best answer.
  C: "markedly inclusive" describes the idea of self in pre-contact Native American cultures, but does not relate to the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  D: "seemingly more fragmented" describes one mode of expressing personal history in pre-contact Native American cultures but does not relate to the author's attitude.
  E: "alien to the European style" describes intercultural collaboration in pre-contact Native American cultures, but does not relate to the author's attitude.
Criticism: 
  Answer A seems like a possible answer, but it only partially represents the author's attitude. The author points out that the scholarship has limitations, but does not necessarily say that it has completely "failed." The other answers do not adequately reflect the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how scholars have focused on written forms of Native American autobiographies, ignoring traditional preliterate modes of communicating personal history. 
  The passage suggests that these scholars failed to consider the cultural constructs of diverse Native American peoples, who did not share the Europeans' conception of self, life, and writing. 
  The passage further suggests that Native American modes of autobiography were more inclusive, fragmented, and oriented toward current events than European modes of autobiography.
Thought: 
  The question asks for the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies. 
  The passage suggests that scholars have limited their studies to written as-told-to life histories and have overlooked traditional modes of personal history. 
  The passage indicates that these scholars have failed to consider the cultural diversity of Native American peoples and their distinctive modes of expressing personal history. 
  Therefore, since the author critiques scholars for overlooking these features of Native American autobiographical narratives, the author's attitude is likely negative or critical.
  Choice A, "failed to address," suggests that the author views the earlier scholarship as lacking in some way, which is true. 
  Choice B, "highly diverse," describes Native American peoples but does not directly relate to the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship. 
  Choice C, "markedly inclusive," describes a feature of pre-contact Native American cultures, which the author finds significant but does not directly relate to the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship. 
  Choice D, "seemingly more fragmented," describes the difference between Native American and European modes of personal history, which the author notes but does not use to characterize the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship. 
  Choice E, "alien to the European style," describes a feature of Native American modes of personal history that differs from European autobiography, which the author notes but does not use to convey the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not overtly express the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies. 
  While the author critiques the limitations of the earlier scholarship, the passage does not convey an emotional tone or judgmental language about the scholars themselves. 
  Therefore, none of the choices accurately reflect the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The author argues that this scholarship has overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history and has failed to address important cultural constructs of Native American peoples.
Thought: 
  The author is critical of the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies and identifies several key gaps in this scholarship.
  The phrase that best conveys the author's attitude toward this scholarship is "failed to address" (line 9), because this phrase indicates a significant, crucial flaw in the earlier scholarship.
  The other phrases— "highly diverse" (line 10), "markedly inclusive" (line 16), "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24), and "alien to the European style" (line 51)— indicate aspects of Native American cultures and modes of communication that the author is describing and analyzing, rather than expressing an attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the limitations of most scholarship on Native American autobiographies, which has focused exclusively on written documents in the European style that were produced with non-Native American collaborators.
Thought:
  The author expresses a critical attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The author argues that the earlier scholarship "overlooked" traditional Native American modes of communicating personal history (line 3).
  The author argues that the earlier scholarship "failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples" (lines 9-10).
  Therefore, the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship is critical because they did not give accurate account of the Native American cultures.
  A: "Failed to address" (line 9) is evidence of the author's critical attitude.
  B: "Highly diverse" (line 10) is not related to the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  C: "Markedly inclusive" (line 16) is not related to the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship. 
  D: "Seemingly more fragmented" (line 24) presents a contrast between the traditional Native American modes and European style without expressing a clear attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  E: "Alien to the European style" (line 51) describes the differences between the Native American modes and European style, but it does not express the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses the limitations of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies, which focused on written accounts in English, and did not take into account pre-literate modes of communication or cultural differences between Native American and European concepts of self and life history. 
A: "failed to address" suggests that the author has a negative view of the earlier scholarship.
B: "highly diverse" describes the Native American peoples, but does not indicate the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship. 
C: "markedly inclusive" describes a feature of some pre-contact Native American cultures, but does not indicate the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship. 
D: "seemingly more fragmented" indicates a difference between Native American and European modes of autobiography, but does not necessarily indicate the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship. 
E: "alien to the European style" suggests that the author sees the earlier scholarship as different from European autobiography, but does not necessarily indicate a positive or negative attitude toward it.
Thought: 
The passage critiques the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies for overlooking pre-literate modes of communication and cultural differences, so it seems likely that the author has a negative attitude toward that scholarship. 
A: "failed to address" supports this interpretation.
B: "highly diverse" and C: "markedly inclusive" do not indicate a positive or negative attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
D: "seemingly more fragmented" could be interpreted as a criticism of the earlier scholarship, but the phrase "seemingly" suggests a tentative attitude rather than a strong opinion.
E: "alien to the European style" also suggests a difference between Native American and European concepts of autobiography, but again does not necessarily indicate a positive or negative attitude toward the earlier scholarship. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limits of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  A: "failed to address" indicates a negative attitude toward the scholarship.
  B: "highly diverse" refers to the Native American peoples, not the scholarship itself.
  C: "markedly inclusive" describes the cultural constructs of some Native American peoples, not the earlier scholarship.
  D: "seemingly more fragmented" describes the pre-contact Native American mode of autobiographical expression, not the earlier scholarship.
  E: "alien to the European style" describes the intercultural collaboration that shaped Native American autobiographical expression, rather than the earlier scholarship directly.
Thought: 
  The author points out limitations of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The earlier scholarship mainly focused on written as-told-to life histories recorded by non-Native American collaborators.
  However, the author argues that such scholarship fails to address traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history that were central to some Native American cultures.
  Therefore, the author may have a negative attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
  In particular, the author may view it as inadequate or incomplete.
  The closest phrase that fits this attitude is "failed to address."
  Thus, the answer is A: "failed to address."
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the phrase "failed to address" best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The other answer choices are not as closely related to the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship, or they refer to different aspects of the passage.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism
  D: admiration for its subtle critique of contemporary culture
  E: appreciation for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses two concepts: the Pin Factory (increasing returns to scale) and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory explains how there are increasing returns to scale, and therefore, an advantage to larger size in some industries.
  However, increasing returns to scale can lead to natural tendencies towards monopoly, and monopolies are a threat to the Invisible Hand because competition is necessary for it to work properly.
Thought: 
  Increased size leads to increased productivity, which is an advantage in some industries.
  However, increased size leads to a natural tendency towards monopoly power.
  Therefore, if there is evidence that increased size does not necessarily lead to greater monopoly power, it would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice A suggests that larger businesses are not always monopolies or able to exert monopoly power, and that there are businesses that can achieve monopoly power even if they are not the largest in the industry.
  Therefore, choice A would undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The author describes a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
The Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of increased size, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry.
Increasing returns can lead to monopoly, while diminishing returns ensure many competitors.
Thought:
The author suggests that increasing returns to scale can cause businesses to become monopolies.
Monopolies are undesirable because they can harm consumers by charging higher prices.
Therefore, if an industry can have increased size without leading to monopoly power, it would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes a contradiction inherent in economic theory since Adam Smith's time.
  Smith describes the efficiency gains of large firms, but the author explains that larger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, eventually leading to monopoly power.
  The concept of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries because it lent itself to mathematical representation.
  Economists have long sought rigorous mathematical representations of their ideas.
Thought:
  The author is suggesting that increasing returns (e.g. increased efficiency with larger firms) can often lead to monopoly power, which is contrary to the assumption that free markets are always best.
  For the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors (i.e. no monopoly power) in each industry.
  Therefore, if there are examples of larger businesses not driving smaller firms out of business and not leading to monopoly power, this contradicts the author's argument.
  Choice A suggests that this may be the case.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The author describes a contradiction between the concept of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the efficiency gains that come with increased scale, while the Invisible Hand relies on competition to prevent monopoly power.
  Increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly power.
Thought:
  The author implies that if returns to scale are not clearly associated with monopoly power, then the connection between the Pin Factory and monopoly power is not definitive.
  Answer choice A mentions that some businesses have a monopoly in certain regions despite there being larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  This implies that size alone may not always lead to increased market share or monopoly power, thereby weakening the connection between Pin Factory and monopoly power.
  Therefore, the answer is A.
Criticism:
  The answer correctly identifies a scenario where a business is able to remain dominant despite having a smaller size when compared to other businesses in the same industry. 
  However, there may be other factors at play that allow for these businesses to maintain their monopoly power, regardless of size, such as brand power or government regulations.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The excerpt discusses the struggle between the Pin Factory's increasing returns to scale and the Invisible Hand's need for many competitors to prevent monopoly power.
Thought: 
  If there is evidence that firms can achieve increasing returns to scale without driving smaller firms out of the industry, then the connection between size and monopoly power is not as strong as the author suggests.
  Option A does not undermine the connection because it supports the idea that firms can exert monopoly power despite competition from larger firms in other regions.
  Option B also does not undermine the connection because it discusses the impact of increased specialization on salaries, not on the relationship between firm size and monopoly power.
  Option C strengthens the connection by emphasizing that when industries are dominated by only a few players, they have the power to set prices as high as they would if they were truly a monopoly.
  Option D does not undermine the connection because it acknowledges that industries vary in the size of firms needed to achieve increasing returns, which does not address how larger firms impact competition.
  Option E also does not undermine the connection because it only discusses the costs of further specialization, not how larger firms interact with smaller firms in the industry.
Criticism: 
  N/A
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. 
  The Pin Factory represents the idea of increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand represents free markets. 
  Increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopolies. 
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that monopolies can arise from the idea of increasing returns to scale if the industry has few players.
  It would therefore undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power if the size of a business needed to reach before it could achieve increasing returns to scale varied widely from industry to industry. 
  This is because a larger business would not always be able to dominate smaller competitors if larger size did not always confer monopoly power. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The article presents a problem that arises when accepting the assumption of increasing returns to scale as true. This assumption implies bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, leading to few players in the market and the probability of monopoly power. There is a connection between the size of the firm and the monopoly power. 
A: The choice presents a situation where larger businesses in one region do not exert monopoly power, while smaller businesses in another region do. The argument in the paragraph is that as firms grow larger, they tend to push out smaller competitors, increasing their own market share. Therefore, this choice does not affect the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
B: The choice presents a situation where the salaries of workers narrow, doesn't directly affect the connection between increased size and the monopoly power.
C: This choice presents a situation where when an industry is dominated by a few players, these businesses collude to set prices, increasing monopoly power. Therefore, this choice strengthens the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
D: This states the size required to reach increasing returns vary between industries. As this doesn't directly affect the connection between increased size and monopoly power, this is not the right answer.
E: This answer states that there are other costs related to specialized workers, such as training costs and higher turnover, which offset the gains from increased productivity. This answer presents a situation where increasing returns to scale do not happen, and that doesn't directly affect the connection between increased size and the monopoly power. 

Thought: Options A, B, D, and E do not directly affect the connection between increased size and monopoly power. Option C, on the other hand, strengthens the argument and reinforces the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 

Criticism: None.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The article describes a contradiction between the concepts of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory concept emphasizes the huge increases in efficiency that can be achieved through increased size and specialization of labor.
  The article notes that a natural tendency toward monopoly is created when there are increasing returns to scale, and that this tendency can lead to a lack of competition.
  The article suggests that free markets depend on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
Thought:
  One of the main concerns with increasing returns to scale is that they can lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly because larger businesses can achieve larger scale and lower costs than smaller businesses.
  If there are larger businesses in an industry that do not have monopoly power, then this would suggest that there is not a direct and inevitable connection between increased size and monopoly power, and would weaken the idea that free markets always lead to monopolies.
  Therefore, option A is the most likely to undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the contradiction between Adam Smith's concept of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  Adam Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size.
  Thus, there are increasing returns to scale, the bigger the factory the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker.
  However, increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
Thought: 
  The author discusses how increased size can lead to monopoly power.
  But, the answer choices ask which would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option A discusses how some businesses can exert monopoly power regionally even if there are larger businesses in other regions. But this is unrelated to the size of the businesses. So it doesn't undermine the connection.
  Option B talks about how more specialized workers may not be able to command as high a salary. But this doesn't address the issue of increased size leading to monopoly power, so it's irrelevant.
  Option C discusses how larger firms may collude with other large firms. This reinforces the idea of increasing returns leading to monopoly power, so it doesn't undermine the connection.
  Option D describes how the size that a business needs to reach before achieving increasing returns varies. This actually reinforces the idea of increasing returns, so it doesn't undermine the connection.
  Option E argues that any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover. This suggests that there is a limit to the benefits of specialization and thus of the increasing returns. Therefore, it undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Therefore, the right answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
The passage describes a contradiction between two concepts in economic theory: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. The Pin Factory highlights the benefits of increased scale and specialization, while the Invisible Hand highlights the benefits of competition and many players in a market. The Pin Factory is associated with increasing returns to scale while the Invisible Hand is associated with diminishing returns to scale. The connection between increased size and monopoly power is that large businesses can achieve lower costs and drive out smaller competitors until the industry becomes dominated by just a few players.
Thought: 
The author argues that if returns to scale are increasing, bigger firms will tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. If the size of a business needed to achieve increasing returns varies widely from industry to industry, this would suggest that the connection between increased size and monopoly power is not strong. Option A describes that some businesses are able to exert monopoly power in one region even though they face larger businesses in other regions. This suggests that the size of a business is not always the determining factor in monopoly power. 
Therefore, Option A would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society
  E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  He did not agree with the radical critics' view of realism in literature.
  The radical critics demanded that reality be depicted "as it is," and that it should contribute to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was not separate from the experiences of individuals, and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky did not agree with the radical critics' view of realism because he believed that reality was not independent of the experiences of individuals and there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  He did not agree with the radical critics' demand for art to serve a particular political view.
  Dostoyevsky believed that literature had a deeper understanding of reality, and that art should not be used only for political purposes; it should stand or fall on its artistic merit.
  Therefore, he believed that reality was the crucial source of successful literature.
  The correct answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct and you have identified Dostoyevsky's disagreement with the radical critics' view of realism.
  However, you did not mention the other options, such as B, C, D, and E, so it is not clear if they are incorrect.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  Reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it; what may not be reality for you may be reality for me.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' that art should have a strict relation to reality.
  He believed that reality was shaped by personal experience and that there is no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns.
  Dostoyevsky's definition of artist laid on the ability to write well and fully express thoughts in characters and images.
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' claim that art must be useful and in service of a political view.
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature.
  However, it was specifically because he believed that reality was shaped by personal experience and there is no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  Dostoevsky believed that art should neither be elevated above nor reduced beneath the portrayal of reality.
  Therefore, options B, C, and E are wrong.
  Option D is also wrong because the passage does not mention that Dostoevsky believed that realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society. 
Action: Answer("A")

Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. 
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society. 

Thought:
  The correct answer is the one that correctly captures why Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature.
  Dostoyevsky disagreed because he believed that reality, though a crucial source, was far more than tangible experiences; it also included a sphere that exists within perceptible reality, that is, the fantastic. 
  Dostoyevsky believed that the task of the writer was less about depicting reality as it exists in order to expose social inequalities, and more about exploding the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Furthermore, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view that art must serve a particular political view, as he believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit. 
  Overall, Dostoevsky's disagreement with these critics was fundamentally about his belief that literature was an art form and should therefore not be constrained by the views of its critics.

Evaluation:
  The options presented all pertain to Dostoyevsky's disagreement with the radical critics' view of realism.
  A is something Dostoyevsky believed, but it does not capture his disagreement with the radical critics' view of realism.
  B is not something Dostoyevsky believed; he disagreed with a requirement that art must serve a particular political view, not that realism is unequal to the task of representing political views.
  C is not something Dostoyevsky believed; he disagreed with the view that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality. 
  D is not something Dostoyevsky believed; he did not oppose the exposure of social inequities or the creation of a new society. Rather, he believed that the task of the writer was less about depicting reality as it exists.
  E is partially true, but it does not capture Dostoyevsky's essential disagreement with the radical critics' view of realism. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. According to the passage, during Dostoyevsky's time, there was a debate between two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism— one position which maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society.

  3. Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society because he believed sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
  4. Dostoyevsky believed that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms since only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals.
Thought:
  1. Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature.
  2. The radical critics' view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it contributed to the creation of a new society.
  3. Dostoyevsky believed that a work of art should stand or fall on its artistic merit and that a literary work must be fully realized to fulfill its goals.
  4. Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society.
  5. Therefore, Dostoevsky disagreed with the radical critics' practical and utilitarian purpose of realism.
  6. The correct answer is D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
Criticism:
  The passage does not directly suggest that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the social purpose of radical critics, but he believed that realism should be handled as a unique aspect of human experience and should explode the boundaries of the real world. So, answer choice A could be another possible answer. Answer C is not clearly suggested in the passage. Answer B does not accurately reflect Dostoyevsky's view. Answer E does not accurately reflect the contents of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's views on realism and literary criticism. He disagrees with the radical critics' view that literature must be realistic and portray social inequities in order to be useful.
  A: The passage does state that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the individual experiencing it.
  B: The passage does not mention Dostoyevsky's views on literature's representation of political views.
  C: The passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky believed that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality.
  D: The passage does suggest that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' views that art must portray reality "as it is" and that literature must be useful for a specific political purpose.
  E: The passage does suggest that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was "literature's crucial source."
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of literature.
  He believed that reality was shaped by individual experiences and that there was a fantastic side to reality.
  He did not believe that literature needed to be realistic or serve a particular political purpose.
  The answer must reflect Dostoyevsky's disagreement with the radical critics' views on realism and literature's purpose.
  The best answer is D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
Criticism:
  The passage does not explicitly state that Dostoyevsky believed that realism does not facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
  However, the passage does suggest that Dostoyevsky did not agree with the radical critics' views on realism, which included the belief that literature must be useful in exposing social inequities and contributing to the creation of a new society. 
  Therefore, D is the closest answer choice to reflecting Dostoyevsky's views on the radical critics' emphasis on realism and literature's political purpose.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on realism and literary criticism in Russia during his time.
  A: According to Dostoyevsky, reality was shaped by the person who experienced it and there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. 
  B: Dostoyevsky rejected the radical critics' view that art needed to serve specific political views.
  C: The passage notes that one position in Russian literary criticism maintained that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality.
  D: The radical critics believed that literature should expose social inequities and contribute to the creation of a new society. 
  E: Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source but that it could go beyond merely the tangible and realistic. 
Thought: 
  The question asks about Dostoyevsky's disagreement with the radical critics' view of realism in literature.
  The passage notes that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the individual who experienced it and that there was no distinction between fantasy and reality. 
  This seems to suggest that Dostoyevsky would disagree with the radical critics' view of realism, which demanded that reality be depicted "as it is".
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky likely believes that realism in literature is not sufficient or accurate in portraying reality.
  The answer is D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
Criticism: 
  While the passage suggests that Dostoyevsky disagrees with the radical critics' view of realism, it doesn't explicitly state that he thinks realism does not facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
  It is possible that Dostoyevsky believed in the potential for literature to expose social inequities and contribute to societal change, but did not agree with the radical critics' approach or narrow view of realism.
  Therefore, the answer choice may be an oversimplification of Dostoyevsky's beliefs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a position on the role of literature in portraying reality that differed from the two competing schools of thought in Russia at the time.
  His understanding of reality differed from the schools of thought that claimed reality needed to be depicted as it is in order to contribute to social change.
  He believed that artistic merit was more important than having a utilitarian purpose.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was different for every individual.
  He believed that reality was not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns.
  He believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  He believed that realism did not facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
  Therefore, the answer is D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was different for every individual.
  However, he did not believe that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality. 
  Additionally, he did not believe that realism was unequal to the task of representing political views. 
  Rather, he believed that utilitarianism was not a sufficient standard for evaluating literature. 
  Specifically, he believed that the focus on usefulness for social change was misplaced.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, C, or B. 
  The answer is E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature.
  For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible.  
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' views on realism in literature.
  For Dostoyevsky, reality was all-encompassing and was shaped by individual experiences.
  The radical critics' demand for accurate portrayal of reality was meaningless, as what is reality for one person may not be for another.
  Dostoyevsky also believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit.
  Therefore, he disagreed with the radical critics' demands that art must be useful in serving any particular political view.
  The answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
Criticism: 
  Your thoughts are correct.
  Therefore, the answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's view of the role of literature in society and his position in opposition to the radical critics in Russia during his time.
  A: Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and that reality was necessarily shaped by individual experiences.
  B: Dostoyevsky did not believe that art should be utilized to promote a particular political view.
  C: The passage discusses the two opposing views of literary criticism regarding the role of art in relation to reality, but Dostoyevsky takes a different position and argues that reality is literature's crucial source.
  D: While the radical critics believed that art should depict reality "as it is" and contribute to the creation of a new society, Dostoyevsky believed that reality was more than just tangible experiences, and that the utilitarian view of art was unsatisfactory.
  E: Dostoyevsky believed that reality is literature's crucial source, and that the task of the writer was to explore the boundaries of reality and create a fully realized artistic work.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's opposition to the radical critics' view of realism in literature.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was more than just tangible and that reality was shaped by individual experiences.
  He rejected the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" because the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Dostoyevsky also rejected the utilitarian view of art and believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  Therefore, according to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed that realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
  The answer is D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the logic or reasoning.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The text explains that there were two competing views of realism in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time. 
  One view maintained that art should be elevated above the tangible world, while the other insisted that art should serve political and social reform. 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position, believing that reality -- including both tangible and intangible experiences -- was crucial for fiction but should not be constrained by any particular political, moral, or artistic agenda.
Thought:
  The question asks what Dostoyevsky's view of realism in literature was 
  The text explains that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source of fiction but that reality was not limited to the tangible, visible world. 
  Dostoyevsky believed that the constraints of radical critics' demands -- that literature should be politically useful and portray reality "as it is" -- limited the imagination and creativity of writers.
  Therefore, Dostoevsky disagreed with radical critics' view of realism in literature since he believed that reality could not be sharply delimited, and that art and the fantastic were intertwined with reality in crucial ways.
  So, the answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
Criticism: None.

Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's ideas about the role of negative evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B gives examples of astronomers revising their theories based on new observations and auxiliary assumptions.
Thought: 
  Passage A emphasizes that scientific research involves not only generating bold theories but also searching for evidence that would disprove them.
  Passage B describes how astronomers revised their predictions of the orbits of two planets, Uranus and Mercury, when their initial predictions were not borne out. 
  The revising of predictions involves altering the theory that underlies the prediction. 
  Therefore, revising a theory is the best answer.
  Answer: B: revising a theory.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's views on the power of negative evidence and provides criticism on it. 
  Passage B presents the historical illustrations of predictions of Uranus's orbit and Mercury's orbit, which were made based on auxiliary assumptions in Newton's laws and revised accordingly, leading to a new theory of relativity.
Thought: 
  According to Passage B:
  Uranus's orbit and Mercury's orbit were predicted based on Newton's laws and auxiliary premises.
  Since predictions for the Uranus's orbit of Uranus were incorrect, scientists changed auxiliary assumptions about the existence of planets, which led to the discovery of Neptune. 
  Similarly, predictions for Mercury's orbit were incorrect, and scientists hypothesized the existence of another planet called Vulcan; but later, with Einstein's general theory of relativity, the calculations matched the observations, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
  In both cases, scientists revised their theories based on new evidence and observations.
  Therefore, revising a theory is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B.
The answer is B: revising a theory.
Criticism: None.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A talks about Karl Popper's contributions to the philosophy of science regarding the power of negative evidence, and how scientific research should involve not only generating bold theories, but searching for evidence that would disprove them.
  Passage B illustrates an example of how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, but their predictions were incorrect. They revised their assumption about the existence of other planets and hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which explains the orbit of Uranus. Later, they predicted the orbit of Mercury, but their predictions were incorrect again. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, called Vulcan, but it was never found. Finally, Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, and calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury.
Thought:
  Passage A talks about searching for negative evidence and revising theories.
  Passage B illustrates how astronomers revised their assumptions about the existence of other planets when their predictions about Uranus's orbit were incorrect. They also hypothesized the existence of another planet called Vulcan to explain the orbit of Mercury, but later discovered that Einstein's theory of relativity explained the orbit of Mercury and rejected Newton's theory of gravity. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: revising a theory.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the power of negative evidence and the concept of testability in scientific research.
  Passage B gives examples of astronomers using theories and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbits of planets and revising their assumptions when predictions were not borne out.
Thought:
  Passage A: Popper believes that for a theory to be scientific, it must make predictions that are testable via negative evidence and that scientific research involves not only generating bold theories but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. 
  Passage B: The astronomers first predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. When the prediction was not borne out, they revised their auxiliary assumptions about the existence of other planets to explain the observed orbit observed. Later, they predicted the orbit of Mercury based on Newton's laws, hypothesizing the existence of another planet to explain the observations; however, the planet was never found, putting Newton's laws into question until Einstein's general theory of relativity explained the observations.
  So, Passage B illustrates revising a theory when its predictions are not confirmed by observations. 
  The answer is B: revising a theory.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science about the power of negative evidence and the importance of searching for evidence that would disprove scientific theories.

  Of the options, "revising a theory" accurately captures the astronomers' actions in Passage B and is also in line with Popper's ideas about searching for negative evidence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's philosophy of science, including the concept of the power of negative evidence and the search for evidence that would disprove theories.
  Passage B illustrates how astronomers revised their theory about the existence of other planets in order to correct their predictions of the orbit of Uranus, and then again with respect to Mercury's orbit.
Thought:
  Passage A discusses the search for negative evidence and how theories are required to make predictions that are testable by searching for evidence that would disprove them. 
  Passage B illustrates how astronomers revised their theory about the existence of other planets to correct their predictions of the orbit of Uranus and Mercury. 
  This is an example of revising a theory based on evidence.

  None
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes Karl Popper's philosophy of science, focusing on the power of negative evidence and the need for a theory to make testable predictions.
  Passage B describes the attempts of astronomers to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury and their need to revise their assumptions in the face of new evidence.
Thought:
  Passage A discusses the importance of negative evidence and the need for a theory to make predictions that are testable. Passage B illustrates this process by describing how astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, but had to revise their assumptions in the face of new evidence. They revised their assumptions to predict the existence of another planet that then led them to discover Neptune near Uranus and, later on, Einstein's general theory of relativity helped corrected predictions of Mercury's orbit.
  Choice B, revising a theory, is the best answer that is mentioned both in passage A and illustrated in passage B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A is about Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science. He maintains that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. He takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them.
  Passage B talks about the discovery of Uranus and how scientists predicted its orbit using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. They found that their prediction was incorrect and hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they later discovered to be Neptune. This scenario is similar to what happened when scientists predicted the orbit of Mercury using Newton's laws and hypothesized the existence of a planet named Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced to predict Mercury's orbit accurately.
Thought: 
  There is mention of generating and checking theories that would disprove them in passage A. 
  In passage B, scientists had to revise an auxiliary assumption to predict Uranus's orbit correctly after they had made an incorrect prediction. 
  Later on, scientists had to revise Newton's laws and hypothesize another planet's existence to predict Mercury's orbit accurately.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Revising a theory.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's view about the power of negative evidence in science and the importance of a theory making testable predictions.
  Passage B illustrates how astronomers revised their auxiliary assumptions, based on their observations, to correctly predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury.
Thought:
  Passage A provides theoretical knowledge about how scientific research involves making bold theories and searching for evidence that could disprove them.
  Passage B presents a real-life example where astronomers made predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the universe, but observations did not match the predictions, revealing errors in the assumptions and leading to their revision.
  Therefore, the answer is B: revising a theory.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's views on the power of negative evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B discusses the attempts of astronomers to predict the orbit of Uranus using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
Thought: 
  Passage A does not mention predicting the orbit of a planet or revising a theory explicitly.
  Passage B discusses the astronomers' attempts to predict the orbit of Uranus using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. When the predictions were not borne out, the astronomers changed their assumptions and hypothesized the existence of another planet, resulting in a revision of their theory. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: revising a theory.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention in passage A whether revising a theory is related to negative evidence. The two passages seem to describe two different things; Karl Popper's view on scientific research and astronomers' attempts to predict the orbit of the planet. 
  Thus, the correct answer could be either B: revising a theory or D: predicting a planet's orbit.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the Mexican American Generation and their political diversity, and the author's criticisms of a recent study by Mario Garcia.
  The author argues that Garcia may be exaggerating the representativeness of the views of the activists he studies, given demographic changes over time and variations in ethnic consciousness.
  A: There is no evidence in the passage to support this statement.
  B: The passage suggests that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States might not necessarily result in an increase in political activism or ethnic consciousness.
  C: There is no evidence in the passage to support this statement.
  D: The passage suggests that variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population might account for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: The passage suggests that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization might account for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Thought:
  The passage discusses demographic changes over time that may have affected Mexican American political activism and ethnic consciousness, including an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States and changes in patterns of immigration and naturalization.
  The passage also suggests that the political diversity of Mexican Americans during this period might have been influenced by the varying degrees of influence of different groups of activists and leaders.
  Therefore, it is possible that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization might account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans during this period.
  Answer: E
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the political diversity and representative nature of Mexican American activists in the United States between 1930 and 1960.
  Though the text discusses factors that may have influenced ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans during this period, it does not explicitly support any of the statements provided.
Thought:
  The passage provides evidence that there was political division among Mexican American activists in the United States between 1930 and 1960.
  Furthermore, the text acknowledges that there may have been differences between the views of Mexican American leaders and those of the general Mexican American population.
  However, the passage does not support any of the statements about ethnic consciousness provided in the answer choices.
Criticism:
  None of the answer choices accurately represents the position of the passage on ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Ethnic consciousness is a term used to describe the awareness and identification of individuals with their ethnic group.
  The passage discusses the ethnic consciousness of Mexican Americans in the United States between 1930 and 1960.
  A: The passage does not support this statement.
  B: The passage suggests that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States may have led to a new generation of Mexican American leaders who were more politically active and determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent, but it does not necessarily indicate a direct correlation between an increase in the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States and an increase in ethnic consciousness.
  C: The passage does not support this statement.
  D: The passage suggests that there may have been variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large, but it does not necessarily indicate a direct correlation between variations in influence and variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: The passage suggests that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization may have contributed to the appearance of a new generation of Mexican American leaders who were more politically active and determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it does not necessarily indicate a direct correlation between variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization and variations in ethnic consciousness.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the presence of a new generation of Mexican American leaders who were more politically active and determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent may have been influenced in part by variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization. 
  However, there is not enough information to determine whether or not this led to an increase in ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans during this period.
  Therefore, choice B, which suggests a direct correlation between an increase in the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States and an increase in ethnic consciousness, is the most supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the political diversity among Mexican American activists in the United States between 1930 and 1960.
  The author argues that there was not a consensus among these groups and that the degree to which their views were representative of the ethnic Mexican population as a whole is unclear.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the relationship between ethnic consciousness and factors such as rates of immigration and assimilation is complex and not fully understood.
  The passage does not provide enough evidence to support any of the choices as they are stated.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage does not provide enough evidence to support any of the choices as they are stated.
  Additionally, the passage does not provide a clear definition or explanation of what is meant by "ethnic consciousness" or how it is related to the issues discussed.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate, and the Mexican American Generation was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. 

Thought: The passage indicates that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States does not necessarily result in an increase in political activism of the ethnic Mexican population. Garcia argues that a new generation of more acculturated Mexican American leaders appeared between 1930 and 1960, but it's unclear how much that extended to the Mexican American population at large.

Answer: E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the political activism and diversity of Mexican Americans in the United States between 1930 and 1960.
  The passage also mentions important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create.
Thought:
  The passage raises the possibility that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States may not necessarily result in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  This suggests that the link between ethnicity and political activism is not straightforward and may be influenced by other factors.
  However, the passage does not support any of the specific statements in the answer choices.
Criticism:
  While the passage discusses the potential influence of patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization on ethnic consciousness, it does not support any of the specific statements in the answer choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the political diversity among Mexican American activists and may be exaggerating the impact of these activists on the ethnic Mexican population at large.
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that ethnic consciousness may vary due to variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization.
  The passage notes that the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the US does not necessarily result in an increase of political activism among Mexican Americans.
  Therefore, it is likely that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  Choice E captures this reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the political history of Mexican Americans in the United States from 1930 to 1960, and argues that the group of activists called the "Mexican American Generation" was more politically diverse than previously recognized. The passage identifies two flaws in the study, one of which relates to the degree to which the activists' views were representative of the wider Mexican American population, and the other of which relates to the diversity of views among the activists themselves.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the relationship between the ethnic consciousness of Mexican Americans and variables such as rates of immigration and naturalization is complex and not fully understood. The author notes that the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States increased during the period under study, but argues that this alone is not sufficient to assume an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage analyzes the political activism of the Mexican American Generation in the United States between 1930 and 1960.
  The passage argues that the Mexican American Generation was more politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized.
  The passage also discusses two flaws in Garcia's study of the Mexican American Generation's political activism, one of which is that it may exaggerate the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period.
Thought:
  The passage does not provide a direct statement about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
  However, the passage does suggest that the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States may not necessarily have resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  Therefore, it is possible that variations in ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans may be influenced by factors other than rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization or assimilation into American culture.
  Thus, options A, B, and C are not well-supported by the passage.
  Option D is not mentioned in the passage and is therefore not supported by the text.
  Option E is mentioned in the passage as a potential variable that could influence ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans. 
  The passage suggests that a better understanding of patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization could help create variations in ethnic consciousness.
Criticism:
  The passage does not provide substantial evidence for option E, as it only mentions it as a potential variable that could influence ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
  The passage does not provide a clear answer to the question of which statement it supports about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passages discuss the degree to which Mexican American activists were representative of the broader Mexican American population.
  The passages do not make a clear statement about the relationship between ethnic consciousness and Mexican immigration or naturalization or assimilation into the United States culture.
Thought: 
  The passage does not make it clear how ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans is affected by variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization or assimilation into the culture of the United States.
  Therefore, none of the choices is supported by the passage.
  However, the passage suggests that the ethnic Mexican population's political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.
  Therefore, variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in political activism.
  Thus, the statement in choice D is the most likely answer.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the colleagues in anthropology who advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
Thought:
  Although Dunham's colleagues in anthropology had advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances and to maintain detachment, Dunham participated in the dances herself and was successful in her research and incorporation of dance techniques into new forms of ballet.
  Therefore, the author is likely to disagree with the methodology of complete detachment in social research.
  The author believes that effective data gathering is often enhanced by a degree of personal investment.
  Therefore, the most likely statement the author would agree with is that the colleagues mentioned in line 33 were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  The answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the advice that colleagues in anthropology gave Katherine Dunham when she was starting her research into traditional Caribbean dance forms.
  The colleagues suggested that Dunham not get too involved in the dances she observed and keep a distance.
  The author describes the long-standing view of some social scientists that conducting research from a position of complete detachment leads to more effective data gathering.
Thought: 
  The author describes how Dunham diverged from the prevailing methodology of social scientists by deeply immersing herself in the dances she was researching and performing them herself.
  The author suggests that this approach was crucial to Dunham's success in understanding the dances as complex cultural practices, learning their techniques, and teaching them to others.
  The author does not suggest that Dunham's method of data collection was less effective or rigorous than the detachment approach recommended by her colleagues.
  Instead, the author suggests that Dunham's method was an innovation that broke new ground in the field of dance ethnology and had a significant impact on the development of modern North American dance.
  The author also implies that the overemphasis on detachment in social research prior to Dunham's work was a limiting factor that prevented dance from being recognized as a legitimate area of social research.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to disagree with the view that increasing the degree of detachment in ethnographic research enhances scientific rigor.
  The correct answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage focuses on African American choreographer Katherine Dunham and her contribution to North American dance. 
  Dunham was both an anthropologist and a choreographer, and combined her skills to bring traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into mainstream modern North American dance.
  Dunham's success was due to her approach to research, which involved participating in the dances she was observing and understanding them as complex cultural practices.
Thought: 
  The colleagues recommended that Dunham not participate in the dances she was observing for fear of physical harm and lack of scientific rigor.
  However, Dunham's success in bringing traditional dance techniques from other cultures into mainstream modern North American dance was due in part to her hands-on approach to research.
  Therefore, the author would most likely disagree with the colleagues' advice to increase the degree of detachment in fieldwork.
  The answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Criticism: 
  The statement in choice C is somewhat of a reversal of the colleagues' advice. The colleagues advised Dunham to not become too involved in the dances she was observing for fear of physical harm and lack of scientific rigor, but choice C suggests they advised her to increase detachment, which is not accurate.
  Additionally, the statement in choice C is a bit too strong in suggesting that extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor. While Dunham's hands-on approach was successful for her, it may not be the best or only approach to fieldwork in all cases.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology.
  She conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms.
  Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
Thought: 
  Dunham's colleagues advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances, but she participated in them herself.
  Dunham's prolonged immersion allowed her to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to disagree with the colleagues' advice.
  Answer: C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Criticism: 
  The author does not say the colleagues advised Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment.
  The author argues that Dunham's colleagues advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  Therefore, both answer choice C and the thought above are incorrect.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author presents the colleagues' advice to Dunham in contrast to Dunham's own approach to research.
  The colleagues advise Dunham to not become too involved in the dances she observes due to physical demands and the belief that data can only be gathered from a position of detachment.
Thought: 
  The author describes Dunham's immersion in the dances as key to understanding them as complex cultural practices.
  Therefore, the author likely disagrees with the colleagues' advice to maintain a position of detachment.
  The author's presentation of Dunham's success and methodology implies that the author believes personal investment in fieldwork enhances scientific rigor.
  Therefore, the statement that the author would most likely agree with is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Criticism: 
  The author does not explicitly say that personal investment always enhances scientific rigor, but rather presents Dunham's success as an example of how a researcher's immersion in their subject can lead to deeper understanding.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the work of Katherine Dunham, an anthropologist and choreographer who incorporated African and Caribbean dance techniques into North American and European dance forms.
  Dunham was one of the pioneers in dance ethnology and conducted research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms.

Thought:
  The passage suggests that the colleagues mentioned in line 33 were advising Dunham to maintain complete detachment, citing her physical safety and scientific rigor as reasons.
  However, Dunham eschewed such caution and actively participated in the dances herself.
  The passage implies that Dunham's approach to research was successful in allowing her to comprehend the dances as complex cultural practices and learn the techniques well enough to incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
  Thus, the author would most likely disagree with the colleagues' advice to increase the degree of detachment.
  The most likely answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:

  Anthropology is the field of study that Dunham had training in.
  Dunham diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time of complete detachment.
Thought:
  The colleagues in anthropology in line 33 were advising Dunham to be cautious and to remain detached while observing the dances she was studying. 
  The author disagrees with this advice, stating that Dunham's personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  The author may also agree with the statement that researchers in the social sciences are not able to gather data in an entirely objective manner, as mentioned in option D.
  However, there is no evidence in the passage to support the statements in options A, B, C, or E.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound
  C: the royalties paid to authors by their publisbers
  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
  E: the total sales ofa book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author is discussing the economic efficiency of digital publishing in comparison to traditional publishing.
  Printing and shipping costs are eliminated in digital publishing.
  The author anticipates that under a digital publishing model, authors will be entitled to a larger share of proceeds.
Thought:
  The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" to refer to costs that are irrelevant to digital publication.
  The author mentions that "the elimination of whole categories of expense means that under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product".
  Based on this, we can infer that the phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to the costs of printing, selling, and distributing physical books that are irrelevant to digital publishing. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the benefits of digital publishing and the costs that are eliminated with this model.
Thought:
  The author talks about how digital publishing eliminates "whole categories of expense"
  The author then goes on to list specific expenses that are irrelevant to digital publishing.
  These expenses include: warehousing, shipping, displaying physical books, and returning unsold books to publishers.
  There is no mention of fees collected by literary agents, the price paid to print and bind books, royalties paid to authors, or the total sales of a book minus the value of unsold books.
  Therefore, the answer must be D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The author argues that the digital publication of a book online eliminates the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and retail stores, displaying physical books in stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. These are the costs of the retail trade in traditional printed books.    
A: Literal agents are mentioned as part of the increased share the authors will demand but do not have anything to do with whole categories of expense.
B: This is mentioned as a cost of traditional publishing but not referred to in the phrase "whole categories of expense".
C: This is mentioned as part of the cost savings of digital publication but not referred to in the phrase "whole categories of expense".
D: This is the category of expense that the author refers to in this phrase.
E: This is not referred to in the phrase "whole categories of expense".
Thought:
  "Whole categories of expense" are identified as being eliminated by digital book publication, so it relates to the cost savings for publishers.
  The author has already described how digital publication eliminates the costs of the retail trade in the physical books, which leads to the conclusion that this comprises the "whole categories" mentioned in the phrase.
  Therefore, option D - the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books - is the correct answer.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence anywhere in the text that supports the idea that "fees collected by literal agents from their clients" or "the total sales of a book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller" are categories of expense. This makes the answer choices A and E invalid. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The author is discussing the impact of digital publishing on traditonal publishing.
  The author mentions that digital publishing eliminates the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers.
Thought: 
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to categories of expense that are eliminated in digital publishing but are present in traditional publishing.
  Among those eliminated expenses are warehousing, shipping, displaying, and returning unsold books.
  Therefore, the answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author is discussing how digital publishing can eliminate certain expenses associated with traditional publishing, such as warehousing, shipping, display of physical books, etc.
Thought: 
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to expenses that are eliminated under the digital publishing model.
  The author explains these expenses earlier in the passage, such as warehousing, shipping books, displaying physical books in stores, etc.
  Choices A, C, D, and E are not mentioned as categories of expenses that are eliminated under the digital publishing model.
  Only choice B refers to the expenses that are eliminated under the digital publishing model.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: the price paid to have books printed and bound.
Criticism: N/A
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the cost savings of digital publishing and the financial implications for authors and publishers.
Thought: 
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" likely refers to the costs associated with the production and distribution of physical books, such as printing, shipping, warehousing, and retail display. 
  The author argues that these costs are unnecessary under a digital publishing model and that publishers can offer higher royalties to authors as a result.
  Therefore, the answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Criticism: 
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" could also refer to other costs mentioned in the passage, such as warehousing and shipping. 
  However, given the context of the passage and the author's focus on the economic advantages of digital publishing, it is most likely that the phrase refers to the costs of traditional retail trade.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The author argues that digital publishing is likely to eventually supplant or rival traditional publishing. The digital publication of a book online eliminates many of the costs associated with traditional publishing, such as printing, shipping, warehousing, and displaying physical books, and therefore, digital publishing is likely to be much less expensive than traditional publishing. The reduction or elimination of these costs will result in a greater proportion of the value of the final product being borne by authors. This will lead to a larger share of the proceeds going to the authors. Currently, a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing physical books. 

Thought: 
The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" to refer to the costs that are specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books. These include warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The cost of producing printed books in traditional publishing includes several expenses such as printing, warehousing, shipping, distribution to retailers, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. 
Thought: 
  The author argues that under the digital publishing model, several expenses that are incurred in traditional publishing models, in particular, the costs of printing, shipping, distributing to bookstores, and returning unsold books to publishers, would be eliminated. 
  Therefore, by "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31), the author primarily refers to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books, which include warehousing, shipping, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers.
  The correct answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:

  Digital publishing eliminates the need for physical inventory and the costs associated with traditional printing, selling, and distributing physical books.
Thought: 
  The author refers to "whole categories of expense" that would be eliminated with digital publishing.
  These expenses are not related to the fees collected by literary agents, the royalties paid to authors, or the sales and returns of traditional books.
  The costs that would be eliminated are specific to traditional publishing, such as warehousing, shipping, displaying, and returning physical books.
  Therefore, the author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" to refer to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books, which is best represented by choice D.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention of literary agent fees or author royalties being part of the "whole categories of expense" that would be eliminated with digital publishing.

Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the issues with jury nullification, including the lack of accountability and the potential for misuse of power.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful check on overzealous prosecutors and can also serve as a signal to the legislature that there may be a problem with a particular law.
Thought:
  The authors of Passage A would be more likely to oppose jury nullification due to its potential for abuse and the lack of accountability of jurors.
  The authors of Passage B would be more likely to support jury nullification because it can act as a check on prosecutorial overreach and can signal a problem with a law to the legislature.
  While both passages recognize the potential for jury misuse of power and both acknowledge that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate, the differing opinions on the usefulness of jury nullification suggest that the authors would disagree on whether juries should have the power to nullify in the first place.
  The authors do not address the issue of whether elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are, nor do they directly address the issue of whether juries should be more forthcoming with their reasoning behind their verdicts.
  The authors of Passage B advocate for the use of discretion in the prosecution of minor offenses, but do not take a stance on whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion overall.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passages A and B both talk about the power of juries to nullify a verdict.
  Passage A mentions problems created by the power of nullification such as lack of accountability and insufficient evidence.
  It also suggests that legislative changes should be made in public and that jurors are not equipped to do this.
  Passage B, on the other hand, sees jury nullification as a safety valve against overzealous prosecutions.
  It suggests that nullification can be a way of indicating to the legislature that a law may be problematic.
Thought: 
  Passage A is critical of jury nullification.
  It believes that juries are ill-suited to the task of revising laws and that their lack of accountability can lead to abuses.
  In contrast, Passage B sees nullification as an important way of ensuring that the law is applied fairly and appropriately.
  It sees juries as a check on overzealous prosecutions and as a way of indicating to the legislature when laws need to be revised.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would most likely disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  Passage A would likely argue that juries lack the expertise to interpret the law and that this should be left to judges.
  Passage B would likely argue that juries have the right to interpret the law insofar as it affects a particular defendant, and to indicate to the legislature when the law needs to be revised.
  The authors do not seem to directly disagree on any of the other choices.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the problems created by jury nullification.
  Passage B discusses situations where jury nullification may be beneficial.
  A: The passages do not directly address the issue of juries being forthcoming about their reasoning.
  B: Both passages suggest that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people.
  C: Passage A suggests that elected officials are better suited to interpreting the law than jurors.
     Passage B suggests that jurors can use their discretion to address overzealous prosecution.
  D: Passage A argues that jurors are not elected, accountable, or obligated to consider the effects of their verdicts on others. 
     Passage B suggests that jurors can use their discretion in certain situations but does not say that they can interpret the law.
  E: Passage B suggests that the discretion of police and prosecutors can sometimes lead to overzealous prosecution.
Thought:
  Passage A argues that jury nullification can be problematic because juries lack accountability and do not consider the effects of their verdicts.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be beneficial in certain situations where the law is unclear or unjust.
  The authors would most likely disagree over whether juries have the authority to interpret the law.
  Passage A suggests that juries are not elected or accountable and lack the legal expertise to interpret the law.
  Passage B suggests that juries can use their discretion to decide when the law should not apply, but does not suggest that they can interpret the law.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  The answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism:
  None
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by the power of jury nullification, including that juries are often insufficiently informed to make reasoned decisions and are not elected or accountable.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous, and that it can also serve to communicate to the legislature when there are problems with a law. The author also contends that instances of nullification driven by reasons that should be ignored are likely to be uncommon.
Thought: 
  The authors seem to agree that the jury nullification power is both powerful and problematic. 
  However, the author of Passage B appears more willing to accept and even defend instances of nullification than the author of Passage A, who focuses more on reasons why nullification might be problematic. 
  The passages do not really address the specific options presented in the question, but one potential area of disagreement could be whether the nullification power provides a way to question or scrutinize laws, as Passage B suggests, or whether it should be viewed more skeptically as a potential threat to the legislative process, as Passage A suggests. 
  Based on this reading, one possible answer could be B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people.
Criticism: 
  While the authors do provide different perspectives on the issue of jury nullification, the passages do not directly address whether laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people, so this option may be an unlikely area of disagreement between them. 
  It is possible that one or both authors might object to the idea that police and prosecutors should have less discretion (option E), but neither passage takes a clear enough stance to rule this out. 
  It is also possible that one or both authors might have some concerns about the transparency of juries' decision-making (option A), but neither passage makes a definitive statement on this issue. 
  Overall, the question may not have a clear or definitive answer based solely on the information provided.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains what jury nullification is and the problems associated with it. It argues against the power of the jury to nullify.
  Passage B gives a more favorable view of jury nullification and argues that it can perform a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature. It defends the power of the jury to nullify.
  A: Both passages acknowledge that juries are not required to explain their verdicts.
  B: Both passages agree that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people.
  C: Passage A argues that jurors are unaccountable and without obligation, but Passage B suggests that juries can sometimes act as a safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous. The passages do not explicitly compare elected officials to jurors in terms of bias.
  D: Passage A argues that jurors are not legislators and that they often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Meanwhile, Passage B suggests that when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature by indicating that there may be a problem with the law in question.
  E: Passage A does not address whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion in which violations of the law to pursue. Passage B argues that when a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, it can be viewed as assisting the legislature.
Thought: 
  The authors of the passages clearly agree on points B and A. While they provide different views on jury nullification, they do not explicitly address other policy issues. 
Criticism: 
  The passages are not clear on whether the authors would disagree about the items listed in the choices. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that jury nullification creates problems because we do not know how the power is used, jurors often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision, and jurors are not legislators. 
  Passage B argues that when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, and a jury can act as a safety valve in cases when there is overzealous prosecution. 
Thought: 
  The authors of both passages agree that juries have the power of nullification. 
  However, the authors of the two passages have different opinions about the legitimacy of this power.
  Passage A argues that it creates more problems than benefits because juries are not legislators, there is no accountability, and jurors often make uninformed decisions.
  Passage B argues that nullification can be beneficial as a safety valve and can help the legislature identify problems with the law.
  Therefore, the authors are most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it, which is the subject of the opinions in the two passages. 
  Thus, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism: 
  None 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the problems created by jury nullification and argues against it.
  Passage B argues in favor of jury nullification and describes situations in which it can be useful.
  A: The passages do not address whether juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts.
  B: Both passages agree that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people.
  C: There is no direct disagreement between the passages about the relative biases of elected officials versus jurors, although Passage B suggests that juries can provide a check on overzealous officials.
  D: The passages do disagree about whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it. Passage A suggests that this is not the jury's role, while Passage B argues that jurors can interpret the law by deciding whether it should apply to a particular case.
  E: Passage A does suggest that problems can arise when jurors have too much discretion in interpreting the law, while Passage B argues that the availability of jury nullification can provide an important check on the discretion of police and prosecutors. 
Thought:
  The question asks for a disagreement between the two passages.
  Passage A argues against jury nullification while Passage B argues in favor of it in certain situations.
  The only option that clearly reflects a disagreement between the two passages is D, which describes the extent of the jury's role in interpreting the law.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by jury nullification and argues against its use.
  Passage B views jury nullification as a necessary safeguard against overzealous police and prosecutors and as a way to signal to the legislature that a law may be unjust.
  A: Passage A discusses the lack of explanation of verdicts, but does not argue for or against juries being more forthcoming.
  B: Both passages agree that criminal laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people.
  C: Passage B argues that juries can provide a check against overzealous police and prosecutors, while Passage A raises concerns about juries' lack of accountability and potential for misuse.
  D: Passage A argues against juries interpreting the law, noting that the legislature creates laws and judges interpret them. Passage B suggests that jury nullification can be a way to signal to the legislature that a law may be unjust, but does not discuss jury interpretation of the law.
  E: Passage B suggests that jury nullification can provide a necessary check against overzealous police and prosecutors, thus implying that police and prosecutors may have too much discretion.
Thought:
  Both passages discuss the role of juries and their power to nullify. 
  Passage A is critical of jury nullification and argues against its use due to various problems it creates. 
  Passage B sees jury nullification as a necessary safeguard against overzealous police and prosecutors, and as a way to signal to the legislature that a law may be unjust.
  The passages do not directly address whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion in selecting cases to prosecute.
  The author of Passage A would likely argue against jury nullification, while the author of Passage B would likely be in favor of it as a way to provide a check against overzealous prosecution.
  Thus, the authors would most likely disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law, but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A explains the problems associated with jury nullification, highlighting that it is an unelected and unaccountable body that is not required to explain its verdicts, lacks sufficient evidence to make reasoned nullification decisions, and can make decisions that do not consider the effect it will have on others.
  Passage B explains that juries should act as a safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous and should use its discretion to decide if a case is too trivial or has extenuating circumstances. The authors maintain that jury nullification could indicate problems with the law while also being uncommon.
Thought:
  The authors appear to disagree on the role of juries in using their discretion and verdicts as a valuable contribution to the law.
  In passage A, the author believes that juries are neither elected nor accountable and have no obligation to consider the effects their acquittal will have on others, indicating that they should only apply the law and not interpret it.
  In passage B, the author suggests that juries should use their discretion to interpret the law and act as a safety valve when criminal laws are overbroad or too trivial. This passage suggests that jurors can contribute to lawmaking by making a judgment on whether the law is unjust or not fair in the circumstances.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries only to apply the law or to interpret it.
  The answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism:
  The passages do not mention disagreement about jurors' transparency or scrutiny and debate of the law.
  The passages do not talk about whether elected officials are more biased than jurors.
  Passage B suggests that discretion is needed to decide whether a case is too trivial to be prosecuted.
  The passages do not talk about police and prosecutor discretion explicitly.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues against the power of jury nullification, saying that it creates problems because we do not know how often it is used or for what reasons. It also notes that juries are not legislators and not accountable for their decisions.
  Passage B argues in favor of jury nullification as a safety valve for situations where the law is too harsh or unjust. It also argues that it can assist the legislature in identifying laws that need to be revised, and that instances of nullification based on inappropriate factors are likely to be uncommon.
Thought:
  The authors of both passages seem to agree that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people, so B is not a point of disagreement.
  Passage A argues against jury nullification because it creates problems, while Passage B argues in favor of it because it performs a useful function. Therefore, we might expect them to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries to interpret the law or not.
  A is not really a point of disagreement since Passage A acknowledges that juries do not explain their verdicts.
  There is no clear indication that either passage argues for the greater bias of elected officials or jurors, so C is a red herring.
  E is mentioned in Passage B as an argument for the usefulness of jury nullification, but it is not mentioned in Passage A.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration
  D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
  E: Some of the refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today contain chemicals known to be environmentally damaging.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  The two scientists who discovered this were Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland.
  CFCs were used in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants.
  CFCs are highly volatile and millions of tons of CFCs were used each year.
  CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  In 1987, the international community signed the Montreal Protocol, banning the production of ozone-depleting gases, including CFCs.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the negative effects of CFCs on the ozone layer and the advocacy of Molina and Rowland to prompt public policy changes.
  Nothing in the passage suggests that there weren't any other refrigerant chemicals discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  The passage discusses the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals after the cessation of CFC production, but doesn't provide data on the comparative amount of chlorine atoms released by these chemicals.
  The passage doesn't mention that CFCs were used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration.
  The passage does mention explicitly that CFCs were banned in North America in the late 1970s, not as a result of the Montreal Protocol.
  While the passage discusses the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals, nothing in the passage suggests that all of them are completely free of chemicals known to be environmentally damaging.
  Based on this, the most strongly supported statement is that "CFCs were banned in North America." which is option D.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:

  C: The passage mentions that millions of tons of CFCs were used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants but not why CFCs were initially used for refrigeration.
  D: The passage supports this statement as the information presented suggests the Montreal Protocol of 1987 led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
  E: There is no information in the passage to support statement E.
  Thus, the best answer is D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
Criticism:
  There is no criticism of the selected choice as it is supported by the information presented in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  CFCs are highly volatile chemicals used in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants.
  Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt policy response and the Montreal Protocol was developed in 1987 to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought: 
  Choice A is not supported by the passage because there is no mention of other refrigerant chemicals.
  Choice B is not supported by the passage because there is no mention of how many chlorine atoms are released by substitute refrigerant chemicals.
  Choice C is not directly supported by the passage. Although CFCs were used in refrigeration, there is no mention of them being the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration.
  Choice D is supported by the passage. The Montreal Protocol was developed in 1987 to ban ozone-depleting gases, including CFCs. North America banned CFCs in the late 1970s leading to the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
  Choice E is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention whether or not refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today contain environmentally damaging chemicals.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the harmful effects of CFCs on the ozone layer, and the advocacy work of Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, whose research eventually led to the Montreal Protocol and the ban of CFCs.
  A: The passage does not provide information to support this statement.
  B: The passage does not provide information to support this statement.
  C: The passage does not provide information to support this statement.
  D: The passage indicates that CFCs were banned in North America in the late 1970s, but it was the international agreement, the Montreal Protocol of 1987, that led to the ban of CFC production worldwide. The passage does not specify whether the Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America specifically.
  E: The passage does not provide information to support this statement.
Thought:
  The passage provides the most evidence to support the statement that the Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America since it specifically mentions the ban of CFCs in North America after the Montreal Protocol.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone
  B: testing to see whether the chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there
  C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine
  D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine
  E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the damaging effects of CFCs on the ozone layer and the need to find alternatives to CFCs.
  Molina and Rowland discovered that CFCs are chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, in the stratosphere.
Thought:
  The question asks for the most useful experiment in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage states that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, in the stratosphere and react with ozone, which results in the depletion of the ozone layer.
  The best experiment to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer would be testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine, which would indirectly suggest if it would cause a depletion of the ozone layer.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the damaging effect of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  The passage explains that CFCs break down in the stratosphere into their constituent elements, including large amounts of chlorine. Chlorine can chemically react in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. 
  Some chlorinated chemicals have been studied as potential replacements for CFCs.
Thought:
  Any replacement chemical that is reactive in a way that leads to the production of free chlorine could contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer. 
  To determine if a replacement chemical will harm the ozone layer, scientists should test to determine whether it will chemically react with chlorine.
  Therefore, the most useful experiment to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer would be to test the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: 
  The other answer choices could be important in determining whether a particular chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. 
  However, considering the information in the passage, testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine is the most helpful approach.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the harmful effects of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  Molina and Rowland discovered that CFCs, when released into the atmosphere, move up into the stratosphere where they break down and release chlorine.
  Chlorine reacts with ozone to destroy it, and the resulting chlorine atom then goes on to destroy more ozone.
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Since Molina and Rowland showed that CFCs are harmful because they release chlorine, an experiment to determine if a new chemical would react with chlorine (choice C) would be the most useful in determining its suitability as a replacement for CFCs.
  The other options do not appear directly relevant to evaluating the potential replacement of CFCs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the contributions of Molina and Rowland to the discovery of the harmful effects of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt policy response, which led to the Montreal Protocol of 1987 to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  If the chemical reacts with forms of oxygen other than ozone (A), it does not necessarily mean it is safe for the ozone layer.
  If the chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there (B), it does not necessarily mean it is safe for the ozone layer.
  If the chemical chemically reacts with chlorine (C), it could potentially lead to the destruction of the ozone layer and is not a safe replacement for CFCs.
  If the chemical or its constituent elements share similar chemical properties as chlorine (D), it could be destructive to the ozone layer and is not a safe replacement for CFCs.
  If the chemical breaks down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation (E), it is safe enough to be considered a replacement for CFCs because the chemical would not build up in the ozone layer and lead to its depletion.
  Therefore, E would be the best experiment to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  CFCs are chemicals that attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Ultraviolet radiation from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  Stratosphere contains a thin, diffuse layer of ozone, which screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  Molina and Rowland discovered that manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage talks about how CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, and then react with ozone to destroy it.
  So, testing whether a new chemical reacts with chlorine (choice C) would be most useful in determining whether it could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone (choice A) seems not relevant for the question.
  Testing to see whether the chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there (choice B) is not focused on determining whether the chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine (choice D) might not provide information on the effect of the new chemical on the ozone layer.
  Finally, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation (choice E) is not valuable for determining whether the new chemical would cause ozone layer depletion or not.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer.
  Molina and Rowland's research showed the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  The ozone layer is a thin, diffuse layer of ozone in the stratosphere, which screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is caused by the release of CFCs in the lower atmosphere, which then diffuse upward and reacts with the ozone layer.
Thought:
  The question asks about which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  A - testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone: This experiment is not relevant to determining whether a chemical can replace CFCs.
  B - testing to see whether the chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there: This experiment is useful in determining whether a chemical, when released into the atmosphere, would be reactive with other compounds, but it does not necessarily mean that it would not harm the ozone layer.
  C - testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine: This experiment is relevant, as one of the main reasons for the depletion of the ozone layer is the release of chlorides from the breakdown of CFCs.
  D - testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine: This experiment may be useful, but it does not directly address the impact of the chemical on the ozone layer.
  E - testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation: This experiment is not particularly relevant in determining whether a chemical can replace CFCs without harming the ozone layer.
  Therefore, the most relevant experiment for determining whether a chemical can replace CFCs without harming the ozone layer is C - testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Stratospheric ozone is important in shielding the earth from ultraviolet radiation.
  CFCs destroy the ozone layer when they react with it in the presence of UV radiation, chlorine being the most destructive element in this reaction.
  Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, conducted pioneering research on CFCs and the effects of these chemicals on the ozone layer.
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The primary concern is whether the replacement chemical would not react with the ozone layer when exposed to UV radiation, which creates damaging chlorine atoms that break down the ozone layer.
  The experiment that would most easily help determine whether a particular chemical would replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer would be testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine, which is central to the chemical reaction that destroys the ozone layer.
  Thus, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the harmful effects of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone layer and how this leads to the depletion of the ozone layer, which causes an increase in ultraviolet radiation and a consequent increase in the risks of skin cancer. 
  Public policy makers have been alerted to the issue through the advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland.
  The scientists found that CFCs react chemically with ozone, leading to a concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere, which in turn leads to a depletion of the ozone layer. 
Thought:
  The question asks what information a scientist would need to conduct an experiment to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage is clear that the main problem with CFCs is that they react chemically with ozone and lead to the depletion of the ozone layer. So, a good replacement for CFCs would be a chemical that does not react with ozone. 
  Therefore, it would be most useful to test whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone.
  A and C are close to the answer. A concerns testing whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone, which provides one wayto determine whether the chemical could replace CFCs. However, it is more important to know whether the chemical would not be harmful to the ozone layer. C concerns whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine. Although the passage explains how CFCs lead to chlorine depletion and subsequent ozone depletion, testing a chemical to determine whether it would react with chlorine wouldn't be the most useful in determining whether a particular chemical would replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.   
Criticism:
  There seems to be no criticism regarding the thought process and the conclusion drawn from the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response, leading to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Thought: 
  The question is asking which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  We know that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Therefore, we need to determine if a potential replacement chemical would have the same damaging effects on the ozone layer before it can be used.
  From the given choices, testing to determine whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine would be the most useful experiment.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
Criticism: 
  While testing whether the chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there could also be useful, it is not the most determinant factor in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine, testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone and testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation could also be useful, but ultimately testing to determine whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine would be the most useful in determining the chemical's impact on the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:  
  In the passage, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were identified as damaging to the ozone layer by chemically attacking and depleting it.
  Molina and Rowland observed that CFCs, when released into the lower atmosphere, slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere.
  CFCs then break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
Thought:
  To determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, we need to identify whether the chemical has the same damaging properties as CFCs, specifically in how the chemical reacts with ozone and chlorine.
  Therefore, the most useful experiment would be testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine (C).

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, and the power of negative evidence.
  Popper believes that negative evidence is at the heart of scientific research, and that scientific research involves generating theories that can be tested.
  Passage B discusses how scientists used their theories to predict the orbits of planets, and how they had to change their auxiliary premises when their predictions failed.
  The passage mentions that one of the auxiliary premises was the absence of disturbing forces.
Thought:
  Passage A mentions that when scientists try to derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which can include the absence of disturbing forces.
  Passage B discusses how scientists tried to predict the orbits of planets using their theories.
  To predict the orbit of Uranus, they made the auxiliary assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When their predictions failed, they changed their assumption to conclude that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  This implies that there was a disturbing force, which was the gravitational force of the unknown planet.
  Therefore, the most clearly illustrated disturbing force in Passage B is Neptune, since its gravitational force affected the orbit of Uranus by causing it to deviate from the predicted orbit.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Popper's views on the role of negative evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and the subsequent hypothesis of Neptune and Vulcan.
  Disturbing forces are mentioned in passage A and are described as potential source of error.
Thought:
  Passage A states that auxiliary premises may include the absence of disturbing forces.
  Passage B discusses incorrect predictions about the orbit of Uranus.
  Auxiliary premises were used to make calculations about Uranus's orbit.
  They made assumptions that other planets do not exist which is an auxiliary premise.
  Another assumption is that there is no disturbing force.
  From the passage B, the existence of Neptune was predicted, which was due to some disturbing force.
  Hence, Neptune is the answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A is about Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, which is the power of negative evidence.
  Popper gives the logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application.
  In scientific research, positive evidence has no value as evidence and negative evidence is tantamount to disproof.
  A theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable.
  When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises.
  When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation.
  Passage B is about the history of predicting the orbit of Uranus and Mercury based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
Thought: 
  The question asks for an example of a disturbing force described in Passage A.
  Disturbing force is an auxiliary premise that affects the experiment.
  In Passage B, Uranus, the sun, Neptune, and Mercury are objects of study, not auxiliary premises.
  The moon is not discussed in Passage B.
  There is no mention of disturbing forces in Passage B.
  None of the choices is the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct.
  None of the choices is the correct answer.
  However, this is because the answer is not present in the question.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how scientific theories often rely on auxiliary premises to derive predictions, which can introduce "disturbing forces" that complicate the interpretation of evidence. 
  Passage B discusses how astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus and later the orbit of Mercury and how they made assumptions that had to be revised in light of their observations.
Thought: 
  The correct answer will identify an object or force that played a role in disrupting the predictions made by astronomers. 
  The planet Uranus and Neptune were discovered because their orbits did not match the predictions made using Newton's laws without considering the possibility of other planets. Later on, astronomers used the prediction of Mercury's orbit as a way to test Newton's theories of gravity. Again, the prediction was not borne out until Einstein's theory was used instead. Uranus, Neptune, and Mercury were not disturbing forces as implicitly defined in Passage A. The sun was an input to the predictions for Uranus and Mercury, but it did not disrupt the predictions. Only the moon had been left unconsidered and therefore qualifies as a "disturbing force" like those described in Passage A.
  The answer is E: the moon.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. 
  The moon's gravitational force is often excluded from predictions of the orbit of Mercury because it is too weak. However, this force can disrupt calculations of Mercury's orbit at very high degrees of precision.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A discusses the importance of negative evidence, and how searching for evidence that would disprove a theory is fundamental to scientific research.
  Passage B presents an example of how when a theory fails to predict an observation, it can indicate that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one.
  Passage B describes how scientists used Newton's laws, auxiliary assumptions, and observations to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury, and how they hypothesized the existence of new planets to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
Thought:
  The question is asking which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A. The only information about disturbing forces in passage A is that they can cause errors in auxiliary premises that scientists need to make predictions.
  In passage B, the scientist's observations of Uranus' orbit not matching their predictions led them to change their assumptions about the existence of other planets.
  Based on the information given, none of the options seem to clearly illustrate a disturbing force exactly as described in passage A. However, the most related option is the sun, which is an auxiliary premise in the scientists' predictions.
Criticism:
  The question asks specifically for a disturbing force "as described in passage A", which is about negative evidence and how auxiliary premises can cause errors in scientists' predictions. Therefore, information about the sun or any of the other options causes errors in predictions cannot be found in passage A.
Action: Answer("None of the above (select closest option: B)")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passages A and B discuss the use of auxiliary premises in scientific theories.
  Passage A describes how positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof.
  Passage A also explains how a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own and that diverse additional "auxiliary" premises are needed to derive the predictions.
Thought: 
  The astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets.
  The astronomers made observations and found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  The astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they later found and named Neptune.
  In Passage A, "absence of disturbing forces" is mentioned as one of the "auxiliary" premises needed to derive the predictions.
  The only answer choice that could be described as a "disturbing force" is E, the moon.
  However, the moon is not relevant to Passage B since it is not mentioned.
  None of the other answer choices match the description of a "disturbing force".
  Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage details a story of astronomers predicting orbits of planets with the help of Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers were wrong in their prediction for Uranus resolved it by revising their assumptions.
  They repeated the exercise for Mercury, predicted a planet that was never found, and ultimately revised Newton's theory with general relativity.
Thought:
  The term "disturbing forces" is used in passage A (line 26) to indicate one of the possible "auxiliary" premises used by scientists to derive predictions for a theory. Disturbing forces refer to additional factors, such as gravitational pull from other celestial bodies, that may interfere with the predicted orbit of planets. A better explanation for failure of a prediction must take these possibilities into account.
  When astronomers made the prediction for Uranus's orbit, they made an auxiliary assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. In the absence of such auxiliary assumptions, there might have been other disturbances like other planets. 
  Hence, Uranus can be considered as a possible disturbing force.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contribution to philosophy of science. 
  It highlights his focus on the power of negative evidence and that he believes scientific research is about searching for evidence that would disprove theories.
  The passage also mentions that deductive entailment of false predictions makes a scientific theory false. 
  Passage B is about the discovery of Uranus, the attempt to predict its orbit, and the discovery of Neptune.
  It also describes another attempted prediction of Mercury's orbit, the hypothesis of Vulcan, and the discovery of Einstein's general theory of relativity.
Thought: 
  According to passage A, a disturbing force can be an auxiliary premise, which scientists appeal to when deriving a theory's predictions.
  The scientists in passage B based their predictions of Uranus's orbit on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. 
  One of those assumptions was that there were no other planets near Uranus, which can be considered an auxiliary premise that might cause disturbing forces.
  The scientists concluded that there must be another planet nearby because their prediction was incorrect.
  Therefore, the most clearly illustrated example of a disturbing force in passage B is the auxiliary assumption about the existence of other planets near Uranus.
  The answer is A: Uranus.
Criticism: 
  The question asks for the most clearly illustrated example of a disturbing force, but the option A, Uranus, does not actually illustrate a disturbing force.
  The correct answer should be an option that illustrates a disturbance as a result of auxiliary premises or other theories.
  Based on the passage, the best choice would be B: the sun, since the mass of the sun is an auxiliary premise that affects the calculations of planetary orbits. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the power of negative evidence and the logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence.
  It also mentions that when a scientific theory's prediction fails, there is usually more than one possible explanation.
  Passage B discusses the attempts to predict the orbits of Uranus and Mercury.
  It describes the auxiliary assumptions made in these predictions and how adjustments were made when the predictions failed.
  The passage mentions the planet Neptune and the hypothetical planet Vulcan.
Thought:
  The question asks about which choice in passage B most clearly illustrates a disturbing force as described in passage A.
  According to passage A, scientific predictions may fail due to the absence of auxiliary premises that appeal to other theories, correct instrumentation, or the absence of disturbing forces, etc.
  Uranus, the sun, and Neptune are not said to be disturbing forces in passage A.
  Mercury's orbit was not predicted accurately according to Newton's laws, but this is not necessarily due to a disturbing force.
  The hypothetical planet Vulcan was suggested to explain Mercury's orbit, but it was never found.
  The only answer choice that seems to clearly involve a disturbing force is E: the moon.
  The moon's gravitational pull on Mercury could be seen as a disturbing force that would affect the accuracy of its predicted orbit.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's ideas about negative and positive evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B gives two examples of astronomers using predictions based on Newton's laws and other assumptions.
  Scientists needed auxiliary premises to successfully predict orbits.
  Passage A mentions auxiliary premises, which can involve other theories or the functioning of instrumentation.
Thought:
  The passage does not clearly indicate which option describes a "disturbing force."
  The astronomers made predictions using Newton's laws and other assumptions.
  The existence of another planet in the vicinity of Uranus disturbed the calculations.
  After detecting the planet Neptune, the astronomers were able to adjust their auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers hypothesized the existence of Vulcan as another planet near Mercury, but it could not be found.
  Einstein's theory of general relativity helped explain the discrepancies in the observations of Mercury.
  Based on this, it seems that "disturbing force" refers to an unforeseen factor or variable that makes it difficult to make accurate predictions.
  None of the options appear to fit this, as they are all celestial bodies.
Criticism:
  None.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred that the aulbor would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?
Choices:
  A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model ofpub1ishing will be uuiikely to remain economically competitive.
  B: The primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers aud haudheld devices for reading text.
  C: The growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business.
  D: Any book will sell more copies ifit is published digitally thau if it is published traditionally.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The author provides a translation of a proverb in lines 32–33 primarily in order to
Choices:
  A: illustrate the relation between proverb use and education about peer-group relationships in Mexican American communities
  B: provide an example of the tone of a proverb that is frequently used in Mexican American communities
  C: illustrate how a proverb can function as an appeal to traditional wisdom

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a unique position on literary criticism. 
  He believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but understood reality to be deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  For Dostoyevsky, reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and that within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic.
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Dostoyevsky took a unique position on literary criticism that was different from the radical view that maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source but went deeper than what the radical critics imagined.
  He believed that within perceptible reality, another sphere, the fantastic existed.
  The goal of a work of art is not merely to be useful to society but to be artistically good.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would not agree that art should stand high above the present and everyday as the radical critics proposed.
  Option A is incorrect because Dostoyevsky believed that fantastic and reality should be intimately bound up, but it does not suggest that the fantastic element in art should be strong to make it a good work of art.
  Option B is incorrect as it aligns with Dostoyevsky's view on reality but does not refer to the topic about art standing high above the present and everyday.
  Option C is incorrect because Dostoyevsky believed that reality must be understood as involving the fantastic.
  Option D aligns with Dostoyevsky's view about reality involving the fantastic but does not refer to the topic about art standing high above the present and everyday.
  Option E aligns with what Dostoevsky believed as he believed that a work of art does not need to be useful for society but must stand on its artistic merit.
  Therefore, It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with the statement that "It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end". 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky believed reality was the crucial source of literature but that reality was more than just the tangible and that there was no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  Dostoyevsky believed that the fantastic must be closely tied to the real in literature.
  Dostoyevsky believed art must have artistic merit and exist on its own, rather than being required to serve a political view or be useful to society.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the supposed radical view that art should stand high above the present and everyday, as he believed there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. 
  However, he also believed that reality was more than just the tangible and the fantastic had to be closely tied to the real in literature.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would likely have disagreed with the statement in the view held that art should stand high above the present and the everyday.
  The answer is not A, B, or D.
  As Dostoyevsky believed art should have artistic merit and be able to stand on its own, he would likely have disagreed with the statement that art should further some societal end.
  Therefore, the answer is E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Criticism: 
  The thought process and answer are correct.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:

  Therefore, he would likely disagree with this view.
  The radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society.

  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The fantastic must be intimately bound up with the real.

  Dostoyevsky found the radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society unsatisfactory. 
Thought:
  The view that art should stand high above the present and everyday is a position held by some Russian critics.
  Dostoyevsky would most likely have an opinion about this position.

  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit." 
Thought:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's opinion on the radical view of the critics that maintained that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality and the fantastic could coexist and both be crucial sources of literature.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky may not have agreed with the radical view of the critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  Option A claims that the radical view is correct because of its requirement for a strong element of the fantastic. However, the passage does not support this claim directly.
  Option B says that the radical view is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.

Conclusion: 
  Based on the passage, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with option D, that the radical view is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy. 
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: The author most likely lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings (lines 38–43) primarily to
Choices:
  A: show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life
  B: support the claim that Lichtenstein's work was parodic in intent
  C: contrast Lichtenstein's approach to art with that of abstract expressionism
  D: suggest the emotions that lie at the heart of Lichtenstein's work
  E: endorse Lichtenstein's attitude toward consumer culture

  The author is describing the work of painter Roy Lichtenstein and his influence in defining pop art.
  Lichtenstein's work incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings and incorporated the style of comic books.
  Pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism.
  Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it.
Thought:
  The author lists the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings, such as stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps, and stilted romances and war stories, to show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life. 
  The author also mentions that beneath the cartoonish methods, Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism and a deliberate naivete.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how enforcing laws to the letter can be harmful, and introduces the concept of "discretionary nonenforcement" to prevent overinclusion while maintaining the intended scope of laws.
  Capricious enforcement is mentioned as a possibility but is not fully defined.
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement (line 32) refers to enforcement that is arbitrary or inconsistent, and does not follow any predetermined principles or guidelines.
  Passage A argues that capricious enforcement is unlikely to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, if capricious enforcement occurs, it is not due to ambiguity or overinclusion in the law, but rather a failure to follow the intent or the letter of the law.
  Thus, E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law, is the most likely answer.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A talks about discretionary nonenforcement as a technique of law enforcement.
  The author explains that enforcing the law to the letter imposes heavy social costs, but discretionary nonenforcement can reduce the costs of overinclusion without an increase in underinclusion.
  The author also states that discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases.
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement refers to enforcement that is unpredictable or erratic.
  Passage A suggests that discretionary nonenforcement does not lead to capricious enforcement because the law enforcement agency must not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced due to legislative oversight.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law (E).
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the use of discretionary nonenforcement by law enforcement agencies to reduce the costs of overinclusion in laws.
  Capricious enforcement refers to random or unpredictable enforcement of laws.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that discretionary nonenforcement allows law enforcement agencies to reduce costs associated with overinclusion without creating more underinclusion (loopholes). Thus, capricious enforcement is not the central tendency of law enforcement because legislative oversight ensures that the agency is not too far from the intended regulation being enforced. Therefore, capricious enforcement is unlikely to involve enforcing the law based on available resources, prioritizing enforcement based on damage caused by crimes, or not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and its intent. Instead, it would involve not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how law enforcement agencies can nullify overinclusive laws by selectively choosing not to prosecute violators.
  Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare).
  The agency does not appear to be straying too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement (line 32) means that law enforcement agencies are not enforcing the law according to the intent of the legislature in passing the laws.
  Therefore, the answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  Your thought is correct. 
  Therefore, Answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Passage A discusses a technique of law enforcement called "discretionary nonenforcement" which allows law enforcement agencies to selectively not prosecute violators of certain laws.
- Capricious enforcement is mentioned as rare and not the central tendency.
Thought:
- The passage defines "capricious enforcement" as law enforcement that is unpredictable or arbitrary.
- The passage makes clear that such enforcement is rare.
- Given this information, it is difficult to determine what type of enforcement would be considered "capricious."
- One could infer that enforcement that is arbitrary or unpredictable might involve ignoring the intent of the legislature in passing the law and only prosecuting certain violators.
- However, it is difficult to determine from the passage what type of enforcement would be considered capricious.
- None of the choices seem to accurately reflect the passage's discussion of capricious enforcement.
Criticism:
- The passage does not provide enough information to determine what type of enforcement would be considered "capricious."
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how law enforcement agencies can nullify particular laws simply by declining to prosecute violators and that this power is exercised frequently. 
  The passage explains that rules of law are almost always overinclusive, and enforcing them strictly may impose heavy social costs.
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement (line 32) means random or unpredictable enforcement of the law.
  The passage explains that enforcing laws according to the legislature's intent is not the central tendency but is not rare since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct. There are no flaws in your logic.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses discretionary nonenforcement as a technique of law enforcement agencies to reduce the costs of overinclusion of laws.
  Capricious enforcement refers to unpredictable or arbitrary enforcement of the laws.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement refers to unpredictable or arbitrary enforcement of the laws.
  In other words, the law enforcement agency does not follow a consistent principle in selecting cases to prosecute.
  Passage A suggests that discretionary nonenforcement is not the same as capricious enforcement.
  Discretionary nonenforcement involves the judicious selection of cases to prosecute by the law enforcement agency.
  Capricious enforcement, on the other hand, involves selective enforcement of laws according to unpredictable or arbitrary criteria.
  Therefore, the opposite of capricious enforcement is enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws.
  The answer is B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct and follows from the information given in the passage.
  However, the question could potentially be interpreted differently/more broadly and other options (such as "A" and "C") could also be plausible, depending on the interpretation.
  But based on a strict interpretation of the information given in Passage A, your answer is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses a technique of discretionary nonenforcement and how it can be used to reduce the costs of overinclusive laws.
  Capricious enforcement refers to unpredictable enforcement of the law, which can be problematic.
Thought: 
  According to Passage A, capricious enforcement is not unknown or rare but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight ensures that the agency enforces the regulation intended by the legislature. This means that capricious enforcement occurs when the law enforcement agency does not follow the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  Therefore, the answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that law enforcement agencies can nullify particular laws by declining to prosecute violators, which can lead to discretionary nonenforcement as a technique of law enforcement. 
  Capricious enforcement is not a central tendency of law enforcement agencies.
Thought:
  Passage A mentions capricious enforcement, but it does not provide a clear definition of the term.
  Capricious enforcement is described as not unknown or even rare, but it does not appear to be the central tendency of law enforcement agencies.
  From this, it can be inferred that capricious enforcement involves a lack of consistency in enforcing the law.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement most likely involves "not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law".
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that law enforcement agencies have the power to nullify laws by choosing not to prosecute violators. 
  Overinclusive laws forbid some conduct that the legislature did not mean to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule would make it too expensive. 
  The danger of punishing the innocent is a consideration, but can be balanced with alternative methods. 
  Discretionary non-enforcement can be a technique to reduce costs of overinclusion in specific cases.
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement refers to when law enforcement agencies do not follow the intent of the legislature when enforcing the law, such as choosing which cases to prosecute based on personal bias or preference. 
  However, the passage suggests that legislative oversight helps prevent agencies from straying too far beyond intent.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement in this context most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law. 
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide a clear definition of "capricious enforcement" beyond saying that it is not unknown or rare. 
  It is possible that capricious enforcement could refer to multiple behaviors beyond just not following the intent of the legislature.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a debate in the legal community regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  On one side of the debate, scholars believe deliberate crimes are a product of social norms and institutions, and suggest changing beliefs about crime, increasing access to economic institutions, and rehabilitating offenders.
  On the other side, scholars argue that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is a result of individual choice and suggest increasing penalties and strengthening law enforcement.
  Recent legal scholarship has reconciled these positions, suggesting that utility maximization theory can explain crime deterrence as a rational economic decision-making process.
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle explains that people make rational choices based on the expected utility of their options.
  The decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational decision using this principle.
  The two sides of the debate on crime deterrence, in fact, have the same overall effect on utility by increasing the expected utility from lawful activities and decreasing the expected utility from criminal activities.
  This reconciles the two positions as complementary, rather than antithetical.
  The use of utility maximization theory in this context is similar to a judge using evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a legal case, because it provides a theoretical framework for understanding the crime deterrence debate.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  The principle of utility maximization involves analyzing rational decision-making by weighing the benefits and costs of different actions.
Thought:
  The question asks which scenario is most similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  The use of the principle involves using insights from economic theory to analyze the rational decisions of individuals.
  Therefore, the answer should involve a scenario where an expert in one field uses a concept from a different field to explain a phenomenon or make a point.
  Answer choices A, B, C, and D do not involve using a concept from another field, but instead involves explaining or using concepts within their own field.
  Answer choice E is also unlikely, as using a quotable novel to promote good conduct at the start of a bargaining session is more about setting a tone rather than supporting an argument.
  Therefore, None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle in the debate over the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  A: This choice is about an astronomer's use of a metaphor to describe a phenomenon using new technologies.
  B: This choice is about a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics to demonstrate parallel lines.
  C: This choice is about a botanist's use of a quotation to make a point about the competitive nature of plants.
  D: This choice is about a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a legal decision.
  E: This choice is about a mediator's use of a quotation from a novel to set a tone of conduct in a bargaining session.
Thought: 
  The passage talks about the use of the utility maximization in the crime deterrence debate.
  Individuals make choices that maximize their expected utility.
  A crime is a rational economic choice.
  The likelihood of criminal activity increases if the expected utility from crime exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  The two crime-deterrence methods (changing societal norms and institutions, and increasing fines and penalties) both affect the utility equation.
  The two approaches are complementary and not fundamentally in conflict.
  Based on these ideas, it can be concluded that legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to analyze the rational economic choice of criminal behavior.
  Thereby, the most similar scenario to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle is a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a legal decision.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains the utility maximization principle and how it can be applied to the crime-deterrence debate.
    - This principle holds that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
    - Expected utility is determined by weighing the utilities of possible outcomes based on likelihood and totaling those weighted utilities.
    - An individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice within this principle.
  A: An astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies is not similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  B: A drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other is not similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  C: A botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest is not similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  D: A judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case is not similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  E: A mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session is not similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
Thought:
  The question asks which scenario is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  The passage explains how the utility maximization principle can be used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime and how deterrence strategies affect this analysis, finding that both deterrence strategies affect the utility equation in different ways.
  None of the choices seem to match the use of the utility maximization principle to analyze the decision to commit a crime and how deterrence strategies affect this decision.
  However, choice D is slightly more similar, because both involve the use of a discipline outside of law (anthropology vs economics) to support arguments regarding legal decisions.
Criticism:
  The question is misleading, and none of the choices seem to match the use of the utility maximization principle to analyze the decision to commit a crime and how deterrence strategies affect this decision. 
  Therefore, the problem with choice D is that the passage does not mention the use of evidence from anthropology to support arguments regarding legal decisions, while it specifically acknowledges the use of economics/economic principle to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime and how deterrence strategies affect this decision. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle and how it can be applied to the crime deterrence debate.
  A: This choice is about an astronomer's use of a paradox used by ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to describe a new phenomenon observed with the aid of new technologies. There is no connection to the utility maximization principle, the crime deterrence debate, or the legal community.
  B: This choice is about a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics to demonstrate how two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel. There is no connection to the utility maximization principle, the crime deterrence debate, or the legal community.
  C: This choice is about a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest. There is no connection to the utility maximization principle, the crime deterrence debate, or the legal community.
  D: This choice is about a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. There is a connection to the legal community but no connection to the utility maximization principle or the crime deterrence debate.
  E: This choice is about a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session. There is no connection to the utility maximization principle, the crime deterrence debate, or the legal community.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle by some legal scholars in the crime deterrence debate.
  Choosing an option that has no connection to the utility maximization principle, the crime deterrence debate, or the legal community can be eliminated.
  Option D has a connection to the legal community, but not to the utility maximization principle or the crime deterrence debate.
  The answer should focus on the utility maximization principle and the crime deterrence debate.
  Therefore, the best answer choice is not D.
  There are no connections to astronomy, drawing, or botany in the passage.
  Therefore, A, B, and C can also be eliminated.
  The answer is not A, B, C, or E.
  The answer must be D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses an economic principle called utility maximization, which analyzes an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  Using this principle, the decision to commit a crime can be influenced by economic incentives or disincentives, and the expected utility from committing the crime must be less than the expected utility from lawful activity. 
Thought:
  Legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to evaluate the optimal approach to crime deterrence. They suggest that changing economic incentives, such as increasing law enforcement and penalties, can decrease the utility of committing a crime. Additionally, they suggest that increasing economic opportunities can increase the expected utility of lawful activity. 
  Therefore, legal scholars use economic principles to analyze the decision to commit a crime and the expected utility of different activities.
  The scenario in the answer choice that is most similar to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle is the one that also involves using principles from one field to make a point in another field.
Criticism: 
  The scenario in option D discusses the use of evidence from anthropology in a legal case, which is not necessarily similar to using an economic principle in the legal field.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the way in which an economic principle, the utility maximization principle, can be used to reconcile seemingly opposing views on crime deterrence.
  A: The metaphor of ancient cosmologists has nothing to do with the content of the passage and does not relate to the use of the utility maximization principle by legal scholars.
  B: The use of the optical law by an instructor has nothing to do with the content of the passage and does not relate to the use of the utility maximization principle by legal scholars.
  C: The use of a quotation by a botanist has nothing to do with the content of the passage and does not relate to the use of the utility maximization principle by legal scholars.
  D: The use of anthropological evidence by a judge is a plausible argument but it has nothing to do with the content of the passage on the use of the utility maximization principle by legal scholars.
Thought:
  The passage discusses how legal scholars are using the economic principle of utility maximization to find a solution to the debate on the best approach to deter crime. 
  The legal scholars are using the principle to suggest that the optimal approach to deter crime would include elements of both deterrence strategies - increasing penalties and fines as well as improving economic opportunities for individuals.
  The passage does not provide information on a similar scenario.
  Therefore, there is no one scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  However, this means that the answer is "None of the Above" and this is not an available option.
  The closest option could be D, but it is not a good fit.
Criticism:
  The question asks for a scenario similar to how legal scholars use the utility maximization principle, but the options provided are not related or relevant to the principles discussed in the passage.
  The answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a debate in the legal community about the effectiveness of different methods of deterring crimes, specifically deliberate crimes like fraud.
  Some legal scholars believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice and suggest increased fines, penalties, and law enforcement as the best deterrence methods.
  Others scholars believe that societal norms and institutions influence individuals, and suggest changing beliefs about crime, providing more economic opportunities, and rehabilitating convicted individuals.
  The utility maximization principle is introduced as an economic framework for analyzing an individual's rational decision-making regarding crime deterrence methods.
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle can be used to analyze the rational decision-making of individuals regarding crime deterrence methods.
  Legal scholars who suggest increased fines, penalties, and law enforcement as a deterrence method are using the utility maximization principle by increasing the cost of committing a crime, thereby lowering the expected utility from criminal activity.
  Legal scholars who suggest changing beliefs about crime, providing more economic opportunities, and rehabilitating convicted individuals as a deterrence method are also using the utility maximization principle by positively affecting the expected utility from lawful activity.
  Therefore, the scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate is B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other.
Criticism: 
  There is no apparent connection between a drawing instructor using a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other and the use of the utility maximization principle by legal scholars to analyze the rational decision-making of individuals regarding crime deterrence methods.
  The scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate should provide a valid comparison or analogy to the use of this principle by the scholars in question.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a debate in the legal community about the best way to deter deliberate crimes. 
  One side of the debate believes that changing societal norms and institutions, increasing economic opportunities, and rehabilitating criminals is the best deterrent for deliberate crimes. 
  The other side of the debate believes that increasing penalties and enforcement is the best deterrent. 
  The passage introduces the economic principle of utility maximization, which suggests that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice based on the expected utility of the possible outcomes. 
Thought:
  The question asks which scenario is most similar to how legal scholars use the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate. 
  The passage suggests that the utility maximization principle is used to reconcile two opposing views on crime deterrence by showing that they are complementary. 
  None of the answer choices seem particularly related to the topic of the passage. 
  A, B, C, D, and E all involve a professional in one field using an idea from another field to illustrate a point. 
  However, none of them seem to relate to the topic of the passage, which is the use of the economic principle of utility maximization to reconcile two opposing views on crime deterrence. 
  Based on this, "None of the Above" seems like the best answer. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage discusses how the utility maximization principle can reconcile the two positions in the crime deterrence debate, which suggests that a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
Thought: Answer choice A discusses astronomers and ancient cosmologists, which is not related to the topic of the passage. Answer choice B discusses physics, which is also not related to the topic of the passage. Answer choice C discusses botany, which is not related to the topic of the passage. Answer choice D discusses anthropology, which is not directly related to the topic of the passage. Answer choice E discusses a mediator and a novel quotation, which is not related to the topic of the passage. Therefore, none of the answer choices are similar to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists conducted experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium between 1934 and 1939, that resulted in nuclear fission of uranium atoms.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939 which led to the discovery of nuclear fission of atoms.
  Earlier, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
Thought: 
  It took physicists a long time to realize that atoms were being split during the neutron bombardment of uranium experiments. 
  The by-products of those experiments were not identified or recognized by the researchers.
  If the physicists conducting the experiments did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they may have been able to recognize them earlier.
  Therefore, B could have been the most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Criticism: 
  Option A is irrelevant to the problem at hand. Whether or not they were using the same research techniques would not have affected the result.
  Option C is contradicted in the passage. It talks about how some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating the possibility of breaking atoms apart.
  Option D is irrelevant to the problem at hand. It does not seem that the number of physicists conducting the experiments was an issue.
  The passage does not mention Option E.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how it took many scientists several years to realize they had split the atom through neutron bombardment of uranium.
Thought:
  If the physicists had not had specific expectations about the by-products, they might have noticed the significance of the findings earlier.
  Therefore, choice B is the best answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  In the 1930s, physicists conducted experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Between 1934 and 1939, scientists compiled evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing it.
  Lise Meitner discovered that researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms, coining the term "nuclear fission."
Thought: 
  Physicists had compiled evidence that could have indicated that atoms were being split, but they did not recognize it.
  Therefore, if the physicists had been aware of or looking for the possibility that atoms could be split, they may have recognized it sooner.
  Choice C states that the physicists had not been aware of the calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
  Therefore, if they had been aware of the calculations, they may have recognized nuclear fission sooner.
  So, Choice C would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of the means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split.
  Physicists conducted experiments involving neutron bombardment of uranium.
  In the years prior to the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without realizing what they were witnessing.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the physicists were not aware of the theoretical possibility of splitting atoms prior to Meitner's crucial theoretical connection.
  If physicists had been aware of this theoretical possibility, they may have recognized the significance of the evidence more quickly.
  Therefore, option C is most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the path that led to its discovery.
  The physicists conducting the experiments on neutron bombardment of uranium compiled evidence of nuclear fission without realizing it.
Thought:
  If the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, then they would have been more receptive to the possibility of fission happening and more open to the evidence of such an occurrence. Therefore, option B would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists conducted experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium between 1934 and 1939.
  They compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fishion without recognizing it at first.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
Thought:
  Physicists did not recognize nuclear fission at first despite the increasing evidence they were compiling.
  The products of uranium neutron bombardment remained unidentified because researchers expected them to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Otto Hahn's surprising result led Lise Meitner to conclude that the researchers had been splitting uranium atoms.
  Therefore, something that would have reduced the researchers' expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Choice B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, would have reduced expectations and therefore led to earlier realization of nuclear fission.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that researchers did not recognize nuclear fission at first despite the increasing evidence.
  However, other options could also have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists' discovery of nuclear fission was not a direct result of one experiment, but rather compiled evidence over time that was lacking the right conceptual link.
Thought: 
  Physicists lacked the right conceptual link to realize they were splitting uranium atoms.
  Something that would help them make the conceptual link sooner would have been if they had not had expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Criticism: 
  While it is true that the physicists had preconceived notions regarding the outcome of their experiments, it is not the only reason that led to their delayed realization.
  Therefore, the answer is probably not B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists amassed increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939. 
  Earlier, some theoretical physicists produced calculations indicating it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result initially.
  Researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection for the discovery of splitting atoms.
  The discovery was delayed because scientists failed to correctly recognize the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations. 
Thought:
  Physicists took time to recognize the significance of the data in relation to 'underlying theoretical considerations.'
  It would follow that the most likely answer would be something that would allow physicists to easily link the data to underlying theoretical considerations.
  A- the use of the same research techniques does not seem to have an impact nor is it mentioned as having an impact.
  B- This is not the case as researchers were not receptive towards the possibility for such an occurrence.
  C- This could have been the case, but it doesn't change the fact that physicists needed a theoretical connection to the data to make a breakthrough.
  D- This could have been the case, but more experimental results do not change the fact that physicists needed a theoretical connection to the data to make a breakthrough.
  E- Although it could have led to a quicker discovery of splitting atoms, this information is not present in the passage. 
  Therefore, none of the choices seem to be reducing the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Criticism: 
  The question assumes that there is an option that would most likely reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  However, the passage does not provide any information about such an option.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists discovered the means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split.
  Scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  The researchers were witnessing the splitting of uranium atoms.
Thought: 
  Physicists were not even receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms during neutron-bombardment experiments.
  Some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Physicists did not have a particular expectation regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  The researchers were not aware of the calculations that indicated that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  Physicists could not quickly recognize that atoms were being split because they had preconceived ideas about what would or would not happen during the experiments.
  Thus, the most likely answer which would have reduced time, is C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
Criticism: 
  There is no information in the passage to suggest that the physicists' use of the same research techniques had any impact on their ability to realize that atoms were being split.
  There is no information in the passage to suggest that having more physicists doing the experiments would have helped them to realize that atoms were being split.
  There is no information in the passage about the Results of neutron bombardment of any substance other than uranium which could be used to arrive at a conclusion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Scientists began executing neutron-bombardment experiments but did not expect to cause nuclear fission.
  Physicists such as Enrico Fermi had already produced calculations indicating that in principle, it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  In 1939, Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that scientists were witnessing nuclear fission.
Thought: 
  The passage indicates that scientists had already produced calculations that breaking atoms apart in principle should be possible.
  Therefore, the most likely thing to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split would be for them to be aware of the prior calculations indicating that breaking atoms in principle should be possible.
  Therefore, choice C: "The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms." is most unlikely.
Criticism: 
  The thought process is correct, so there is no criticism.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Three positions are presented and each is elaborated in detail.
  B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
  C: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the second in detail.
  D: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be superior to the first two.
  E: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be inferior to the second.
Response 0:
The answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. 

Explanation: The passage outlines three positions on literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time, contrasting with each other. The first maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the second believed that literature should be useful, and the third position presented is Dostoyevsky's own, which is differentiated from the first two in detail. The passage describes Dostoevsky's understanding of reality and his belief that the task of a writer was to explode the boundaries of reality so as to reveal the fantastic, and his emphasis on artistic merit over utility. This focus on Dostoevsky's view and its contrast with the other two positions qualifies B as the correct choice. There is no development of the argument that one view is superior or inferior to another.
Response 1:
The organization of the material presented in the passage is as follows:
  The first two paragraphs introduce the context and explain the two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  The third paragraph presents Dostoyevsky's third position, which is differentiated from the first two in detail.
  The fourth paragraph elaborates on Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality and the relationship between the real and the fantastic.
  The fifth and sixth paragraphs argue against the radical critics' insistence that art must serve a political view and be useful, respectively, and instead emphasize the importance of artistic merit.
  
Therefore, the answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Response 2:
The correct answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. 

The passage presents three positions on literature: one that believes that literature should be above the present and everyday, another that believes that literature should only exist if it finds its sources in concrete reality and contributes to a new society, and a third position that Dostoyevsky believes in, which has a deeper understanding of reality and believes that there is no distinction between fantasy and reality. 

The passage goes on to explain how Dostoyevsky's view differs from the first two positions by stating that for him, reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit. The third position is differentiated from the first two in detail throughout the passage, and there is no indication that the third position is shown to be superior or inferior to the other two. Therefore, option B is the best choice.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses three significant positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The first position maintains that art stood high above the present and everyday, while the second position maintains that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality.

  The presentation of the three positions and the description of the third position are clear in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
The passage presents three positions on Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time. The first position maintains that art should stand high above the present and the everyday, while the second radical position maintains that art should find its sources in concrete reality and contribute to the creation of a new society. Dostoyevsky's position is then presented and differentiated from the first two in detail. He believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but reality was far more than just the tangible. He also believed that literature should not be limited by political views or utility and should instead focus on artistic merit. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Response 7:
The answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. The passage presents three positions in Russian literary criticism, the first being that art should stand high above the present and the everyday, the second being that art must be useful and serve a particular political view, and the third being Dostoyevsky's position that reality is literature's crucial source, but that reality goes deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics. The passage then goes on to elaborate on Dostoyevsky's position and how it differs from the first two presented. Thus, option B is the best answer.
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time. 
  The first position believes that art stands above the present and the everyday. 
  The second position believes that art should only exist if it is found in concrete reality. 
  Dostoyevsky takes a third position that realism is important, but he believes reality extends beyond the tangible and that the fantastic is intimately connected to reality. 
  Dostoyevsky defines artistry as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader understands the author's thoughts. 
  Dostoyevsky believes that the utilitarian claim that art must be useful is unsatisfactory since we cannot predict what will be useful or measure the breadth of a work of art's usefulness.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time and explains Dostoyevsky's view in detail. 
  He takes a third position which is different from the first two. 
  While the first position believes that art stands above the present and the everyday, and the second believes that art should only exist if it is found in concrete reality, Dostoyevsky believes in the importance of realism but also believes that reality extends beyond the tangible and that the fantastic is an important part of reality. 
  Dostoyevsky also discusses his definition of artistry, which is the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader understands the author's thoughts. 
  He also critiques the utilitarian claim that art must be useful since we cannot predict with certainty what will be useful or measure the breadth of a work of art's usefulness.
  Therefore, the organization of the material presented in the passage is best described as: B) Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. 
Criticism: None.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses how evolutionary psychology examines human behavior in terms of its contribution to reproductive success.
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory, where behavior is explained by an unacknowledged interest in the proliferation of genes.
Thought:
  The term "conspiracy theory" implies that evolutionary psychology is assuming a hidden interest in people's behavior that is not acknowledged or even discovered.
  One statement in passage A that could illustrate this is Option D, where genes that promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism:
  While Option D describes an instance where genes may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish, this does not fully capture the idea that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory. 
  Option D does not refer to a hidden interest in human behavior that individuals do not openly acknowledge or are not aware of.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the application of evolutionary psychology to understanding human behavior.
  The main idea of passage A is that seemingly altruistic behavior can be explained by genes promoting their own self-propagation.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it imputes an interest to behavior which the agent of the behavior may not openly acknowledge or even be aware of.
Thought:
  The author of passage B believes that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it imputes an interest to behavior that may not be reasonable.
  The assertion that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish fits with this idea.
  The assertion that evolution psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution is not an example of a "conspiracy theory".
  The assertion that altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology is not an example of a "conspiracy theory".
  The assertion that an altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual is not an example of a "conspiracy theory".
  The assertion that early humans lived in small, kin-based groups is not an example of a "conspiracy theory".
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct.
  Great job!
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and how it explains human behavior from the standpoint of evolution. 
  It argues that altruism is difficult to account for but may have arisen through identification and empathy. 
  It suggests that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish. 
  Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory because it imputes an interest (proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior may not acknowledge.
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish. For example, a mother rushing to help her injured child promotes the survival and replication of genes promoting identification and empathy. Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory because it identifies an interest (proliferation of genes) that people may not acknowledge as the reason for their behavior. Evolutionary psychology presupposes the idea of selfish genes that secretly and subtly control behavior, replicating in the way that works to ensure their survival.
  Therefore, the assertion from passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory is "D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the tenets of evolutionary psychology, which views human behavior through the lens of evolution and the "proliferation of genetic material."
  Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" because it attributes hidden motives to behavior (the interest in gene proliferation). 
Thought: 
  The author of Passage B is critical of evolutionary psychology because it suggests that behavior is motivated by a hidden interest in gene proliferation.
  Of the options presented, Choice D may be the most appropriate answer because it suggests that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This aligns with the idea that evolutionary psychologists seek hidden motives behind behavior. 
Criticism: 
  This choice is somewhat indirect and may not be the best answer to the question because it does not specifically address the idea of a "conspiracy theory." 
  Additionally, the concept of genes promoting self-propagation through seemingly unselfish behavior is just one aspect of evolutionary psychology, so it may not be the most clear example.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the theory of evolution and its application to the understanding of human behavior.
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory."
  A: Evolutionary psychologists examine human behavior from the point of view of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: Altruism involves one individual using valuable resources to promote the welfare of another.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Thought:
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory, implying that it involves attributing behavior to hidden or unacknowledged interests that lead to the proliferation of genes.
  The author of passage A suggests that genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy may promote their own self-propagation by provoking psychological experiences that lead to the enhancement of survival and replication of those genes.
  This implies that the evolutionary explanation for apparently altruistic behavior may be a way in which genes promote their own self-interest through unselfish actions.
  Therefore, the assertion that best exemplifies what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the perspective of evolutionary psychology and how it seeks to explain human behavior through evolution and the propagation of genes.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing interests to behaviors that individuals may not be aware of or openly acknowledge.
Thought:
  To identify the assertion from Passage A that most exemplifies the author's characterization of evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory," we need to find an example of behavior that is imputed with a hidden genetic interest.
  The passage suggests that genes may promote self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother's rushing to help her injured child.
  This idea exemplifies the way that evolutionary psychology can be seen as a "conspiracy theory," as it attributes hidden genetic interests to behaviors that may appear selfless on the surface.
  The correct answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism:
  This analysis seems to be a valid interpretation of both passages.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A examines the perspective of evolutionary psychology, which explains human behavior by examining how it contributes to reproductive success and proliferation of genetic material.
  The passage discusses the thorny problem of altruism and how it could be accounted for by identification and empathy.
  Evolutionary psychology accounts for apparently altruistic mechanisms within a genetically "selfish" system.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology as a kind of conspiracy theory, where behavior is explained by imputing an interest (proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior is not aware of.
  Passage B argues that interests other than proliferation of genes could explain any given behavior, making the inference that genes explain a particular behavior rare.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a kind of conspiracy theory.
  The author thinks evolutionary psychology imputes interests to behavior that the agent of the behavior is not aware of.
  Therefore, the assertion that most exemplifies evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory is one where evolutionary psychology imputes interests to behavior.
  The author of Passage A explains how genes promoting their self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  This explanation by evolutionary psychology of apparently unselfish behavior exemplifies what the author of Passage B criticizes about evolutionary psychology.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  The author of Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology by characterizing it as a conspiracy theory.
  However, the author does not explicitly give reasons why evolutionary psychology should not be considered a conspiracy theory.
  Also, the author does not provide evidence to support the claim that "not all of one's motives can be instrumental" (line 49).
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how evolutionary psychology examines human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution and explains the evolution of behavior such as altruism and how genes may promote their self-propagation.
  Passage B argues that evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory because it imputes interests to the agent of the behavior that they may not be aware of or may not acknowledge.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it assumes that an agent's behavior is solely motivated by interests in the proliferation of genes, which the agent may not even be aware of or acknowledge.
  Therefore, the assertion that best exemplifies this characterization is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A describes the principles and mechanisms of evolutionary psychology and how genes can promote altruistic behavior.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory by suggesting that it attributes interests to individuals that they might not be aware of or that are not necessarily the only explanations for their behavior.
Thought:
  Passage B contends that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it imputes interests to individuals that are not necessarily the only explanations for their behavior.
  The idea that genes may promote their own self-propagation through instinctive and apparently unselfish actions exemplifies this notion of imputing an interest to individuals.
  Therefore, the assertion in choice D most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A talks about the evolutionary perspective of human behavior and how altruism could have originated through psychological experiences of identification and empathy. 
  The passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory that explains behavior by imputing an interest in the proliferation of genes.
Thought: 
  The author of passage B is arguing that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior using hidden, underlying motives like the proliferation of genes. 
  The example in passage A that most closely exemplifies this argument is the assertion that genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. This passage exemplifies how evolutionary psychology connects unselfish actions to selfish motives through the promotion of gene proliferation.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Native American autobiographies and how scholars have traditionally studied them.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used in line 5.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural" suggests two cultures.
  The word "composite" suggests something that is made up of different parts.
  The word "authorship" suggests the act of writing or creating something.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" may refer to the act of writing a text that is created in collaboration between two individuals from different cultures.
  This collaboration may involve translating, recording, and editing the text.
Answer: Answer("D") written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the limitations of studying Native American autobiography through written, "as-told-to" accounts.
  The scholars in question have tended to focus on written documents that were created through "bicultural composite authorship."
  The author explains that some Native American cultures did not have the same concept of self and life that is the basis of Western autobiographical writing.
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as used in the passage refers to the collaborative process by which many written Native American autobiographies were created.
  The author notes that the scholars studied in this passage focused on those written accounts and thereby overlooked traditional modes of autobiographical expression.
  Based on this, it seems likely that "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the fact that the written accounts were created by both Native American and non-Native American people.
  The choice that best describes this would be D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism:
  The author does not specify exactly who participated in the process of "bicultural composite authorship."
  It is possible that the authors of the written accounts were not Native American themselves, but rather simply recorded the narratives of Native Americans.
  While this interpretation would not fit choice A ("written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture"), it is not entirely clear whether choices B, C, or E might also be possible interpretations.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the study of the autobiographies of Native Americans.
  The passage asserts that most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories, which emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to how the as-told-to life histories were created.
  The passage does not explain the phrase beyond its initial use.
  The phrase suggests that non-Native American collaborators were involved in the creation of the as-told-to life histories.
  The phrase suggests that the collaborators were from a different culture than the Native Americans.
  The phrase suggests that there were at least two cultural perspectives involved in the creation of the as-told-to life histories.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" most accurately refers to the as-told-to life histories being written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
  The answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism:
  N/A
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholars who solely focus on the written autobiographies of Native Americans.
  It mentions "bicultural composite authorship."
Thought:
  Based on the context, "bicultural composite authorship" appears to refer to the fact that the written autobiographies of Native Americans were often created with the assistance of non-Native American collaborators. 
  These collaborators would participate in the process of recording, translating, and editing the autobiography, resulting in a final product that was a combination of the two cultures.
  Therefore, option D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture, is the most accurate definition.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how scholars have studied the autobiographies of Native Americans.
  Some scholars have focused on written life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The resulting autobiographies are said to have emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
Thought: 
  "Bicultural composite authorship" is a phrase used in the passage to describe the process by which most written life histories of Native Americans were produced.
  The phrase suggests that the resulting autobiographies are the product of collaboration between people from different cultures.
  The answer must describe a process by which written life histories are produced that involves collaboration between people from different cultures.
  A, C, and E can be eliminated because they do not mention collaboration between people from different cultures.
  B can be eliminated because it suggests that there are only two people involved in the collaboration, when the passage indicates that there can be more than two.
  D accurately conveys the meaning of "bicultural composite authorship" by indicating that the autobiographies are written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the autobiographies of Native Americans and how scholars have limited their studies to written documents that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators. These scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history and have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who view identity relationally and express life experiences through oral communication and various forms of artwork. The passage also introduces the term "bicultural composite authorship" in line 5.
Thought: 
  The term "bicultural composite authorship" suggests that the autobiographies of Native Americans are written by a collaboration between members of two different cultures. 
  This collaboration probably involves one person from a nonindigenous culture and one person from a Native American culture, who work together to create a finished written product. 
  The word "composite" implies that the finished product is a combination of contributions from both cultures.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  You have the correct idea that "bicultural composite authorship" implies a collaboration between members of two different cultures. 
  However, the phrase does not necessarily indicate that the finished product is written. 
  Additionally, the phrase does not suggest that each person contributes in the same way. It is possible that one person contributes more heavily than the other. 
  Finally, the word "composite" suggests that the finished product is a combination of different elements, but it does not necessarily imply that the elements come from both cultures. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the various means of communication and forms of autobiography in Native American cultures prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a specific type of written autobiography that has been studied by scholars.
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to written autobiographies that are produced through the collaborative efforts of both Native American and non-Native American individuals.
  The word "composite" suggests that the finished product is a combination or synthesis of two different cultures and perspectives.
  The word "bicultural" suggests that the people involved in producing the autobiography come from two distinct cultures.
  Therefore, the answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism:
  While the answer choice B correctly conveys the idea that "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a collaborative effort between two cultures, it does not necessarily imply that both individuals contribute in the same way. 
  Other answer choices, such as A and E, could also be seen as partially correct.
  However, given the emphasis on the collaborative nature of the writing process, answer choice B is the best fit.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the autobiographies of Native Americans and how scholars have focused on written documents that may not encompass the traditional way of communicating personal history. 
  In line 5, the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" specifically refers to the as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by the non-Native collaborators that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
Thought: 
  "Bicultural" refers to two cultures, meaning that there are multiple cultural perspectives. "Composite" means to put together. "Authorship" means the state of being an author, usually of a book. Therefore, the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is referring to the fact that there are multiple cultural perspectives and authorship involved in the creation of these written documents.
  Option B refers to two people from different cultures contributing equally to a finished product. This is close to the definition of "bicultural," but it does not mention that there are multiple authorships involved.
  Option D refers to a work that is originally written by one member of a culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture. This answer choice is close to the definition of "bicultural," but it does not mention that there are multiple cultural perspectives involved in the creation of the work.
  Option E refers to a work that was written by a member of one culture, based on oral communication by a member of another culture. This is a close definition to "bicultural composite authorship," but it does not encompass the editing and translating that occurred to produce these written documents.
  Option A and C are not close to the definition of "bicultural composite authorship."
  The best answer choice is D: "written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture." 
Criticism: 
  The answer is close to the definition of "bicultural composite authorship." However, the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the fact that there are multiple cultural perspectives and authorship involved in the creation of these written documents, not just one author from one culture and another author from a different culture. Therefore, the most accurate answer is a combination of option B and D. 
Action: Answer("B and D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how most scholars have focused on written documents and overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history, especially those of Native Americans. The passage introduces the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" in this context.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is introduced as a way that most scholars have focused on written documents and overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history, especially those of Native Americans. 
  The phrase refers to an approach where a non-Native American collaborator records and edits the life history of a Native American, resulting in a composite, or collaborative, written autobiography. 
  Therefore, the closest meaning for this phrase is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how most scholars who study Native American autobiographies focus on written documents.
  These documents are often "as-told-to life histories" that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators, leading to "bicultural composite authorship."
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" seems to refer to written autobiographies that are the result of collaboration between two cultures: that of the Native American whose story is being told, and that of the non-Native American who is recording and editing the story.
  This phrase suggests that the resulting autobiographies are not solely the work of one individual or culture, but are instead a product of two cultures working together.
  The correct answer will reflect this understanding.
Evaluation:
  A: This choice suggests that the autobiography is based on artifacts and oral traditions of a different culture, but it does not necessarily suggest that two cultures are directly collaborating on the autobiography itself.
  B: This choice correctly suggests that two people from different cultures are contributing to the autobiography, but does not necessarily suggest that the final product is a result of their equal collaboration.
  C: This choice seems to describe an improbable scenario that is not suggested by the text.
  D: This choice correctly suggests that non-Native American collaborators edit and revise the autobiography, but it does not necessarily suggest that the autobiography is a result of collaboration between two cultures.
  E: This choice suggests that the Native American culture is contributing through oral communication, but it does not necessarily suggest that the autobiography is the result of collaboration between two cultures.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon
  C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  D: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to introduce the main topic to be discussed
  E: to introduce the main topic to be discussed to present a view that will be argued against
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how people relate their income to some norm, and discusses the phenomena of habituation and rivalry in relation to happiness and wealth.
  
  Passage B argues that the data shows that earning more money makes people happier because it makes them feel successful. The author argues that people are not merely seeking to one-up their neighbors, but rather they use material wealth to show that they create value. 
  
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in both passages.
  
Thought: 
  Passage A mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study in order to provide evidence for the importance of how people relate their income to some norm, and the phenomenon of rivalry.
  
  Passage B mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study in order to argue against the idea that people are solely motivated by one-upmanship, and to provide evidence for the idea that people use material wealth to show that they create value.
  
  Thus, the authors use the Solnick and Hemenway study for different purposes.
  
Action: Answer("B") to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the paradox of the relationship between wealth and happiness and explains the two phenomena of habituation and rivalry which impact the level of happiness. The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned to illustrate the phenomenon of rivalry.
  Passage B challenges the theory that one-upmanship is the reason people feel happy and proposes that earning more is related to a sense of success and creating value rather than just having more money. The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned to support this stance, suggesting that relative prosperity contributes to a sense of success.
Thought: 
  Passage A refers to Solnick and Hemenway study when discussing rivalry to show that relative social status rather than absolute wealth impacts the level of happiness. 
  Passage B refers to the same Solnick and Hemenway study to support the idea that relative prosperity makes people feel successful and thus contributes to their level of happiness. 
  Both passages use this study to illustrate their respective points. 
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B respectively mention the Solnick and Hemenway study to present evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon rather than to introduce the main topic to be discussed or to present a view that will be argued against.
  The answer is C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided.
Criticism:
  There's no indication in the passages that additional evidence will be provided after the Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned. The main purpose of mentioning the study in both passages is to support the key ideas they are presenting about the relationship between wealth and happiness.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between happiness and wealth.
  Solnick and Hemenway conducted a study about people's preferences in relation to their income in comparison to others.

Thought:
  Passage A discusses the paradox of how over time, advanced societies have not grown happier despite becoming richer.
  The passage then discusses the idea of people's comparison to a norm that rises with actual income, and two phenomena that result from this: habituation and rivalry.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is presented in Passage A to support the idea that people's relative position, compared to those most like them, is crucial for happiness.
  Passage B discusses a theory that people have a primeval urge to demonstrate their superiority to ensure mating prospects.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is presented in Passage B as evidence that earning more makes people happier because it makes them feel successful and that they have created value.

Criticism:
  The pair that describes the author's intentions for presenting the Solnick and Hemenway study in each passage is one where one passage presents a view that will be argued against, and the other passage provides evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
  While both passages do provide evidence and explanations for the relationship between happiness and wealth, it is more accurate to say that Passage A presents the view that relative position is crucial for happiness and Passage B provides evidence for the idea that earning more makes people happier because it makes them feel successful and that they have created value.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses research on the relationship between wealth and happiness, including the phenomenon of habituation and rivalry, and how people compare their income to a norm.
  Passage B argues that earning more makes people feel successful and create value, providing happiness.
  Both passages mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway in the context of explaining why people care about relative prosperity.
Thought: 
  Passage A mentions the study by Solnick and Hemenway to show that people care about relative prosperity and compare themselves to their reference group.
  Passage B mentions the study by Solnick and Hemenway to argue against the idea that people care about one-upmanship and to provide evidence for the idea that people feel successful and create value from earning more.
  The authors of the two passages use the Solnick and Hemenway study for different reasons.
  Therefore, the pair of choices that most accurately describes why the authors of the two passages mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway are B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses research on happiness and wealth, specifically the paradox that while richer people report higher levels of happiness, advanced societies have not grown happier despite becoming richer. 
  Passage B discusses a theory about why earning more money makes people happier, arguing that it is not just because of the money but rather because it makes people feel successful and like they have created value.
  Solnick and Hemenway's study is mentioned in both passages and is used to support different arguments.
Thought:
  Passage A uses the study by Solnick and Hemenway to support the argument that people compare their income to some norm and that the norm rises along with actual income. The study's result is used as evidence that people are more concerned with their relative position than their absolute income level. 
  Passage B, on the other hand, uses the study by Solnick and Hemenway to argue against the theory that people care most about one-upmanship. Instead, it suggests that people care about earning more money because it makes them feel successful and like they have created value. The study's result is used as evidence that people care more about feeling successful and creating value than about having more than others.
  Therefore, the authors mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway for different reasons, to provide evidence for different arguments.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses research on the relationship between income and happiness, primarily focusing on the role of social comparison in influencing happiness.
  Passage B challenges the idea that happiness is primarily driven by a desire for one-upmanship and argues that it is actually driven by a desire for success and creating value.
  Both passages mention the Solnick and Hemenway study, in which participants were asked to choose between two options with different income levels and relative positions.
Thought:
  Passage A mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study in the context of discussing social comparison and the importance of relative positions for happiness.
  Passage B mentions the study to challenge the idea that happiness is primarily driven by a desire for one-upmanship and instead argue that it is driven by a desire for success and creating value.
  Therefore, the authors mention the study for different reasons: Passage A uses it as evidence for the importance of social comparison, while Passage B uses it to critique the idea that one-upmanship is the primary driver of happiness.
  The most accurate pair that describes why the authors mention the study is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B both mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study involved a choice between two income options: one with higher absolute income but lower relative income, and one with lower absolute income but higher relative income.
  Passage A uses the study to discuss the importance of relative income in determining happiness.
  Passage B uses the study to argue against the "one-upmanship" theory of happiness and instead support the idea that earning more money can lead to happiness because it represents creating value.
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses how people's happiness is influenced by relative income, and it bring up Solnick and Hemenway's study to provide evidence for this point. 
  Passage B argues against the "one-upmanship" theory of happiness and instead provides evidence of how earning more money can lead to happiness because it represents creating value. 
  It brings up the same Solnick and Hemenway study to provide this evidence.
  Therefore, both passages use the study for different purposes.
  The answer is C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses research on the relationship between wealth and happiness and how people compare their income with some norm that rises along with actual income.
  Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful, that they have created value, and wanting to create value benefits society.
  Solnick and Hemenway's study is mentioned in both passages.
Thought: 
  In Passage A, Solnick and Hemenway's study is mentioned to support the idea that how people compare to their "reference group" is crucial for happiness.
  In Passage B, Solnick and Hemenway's study is mentioned to provide evidence for the idea that earning more makes people happier because it makes them feel successful and that they have created value.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B respectively mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon and to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
  The answer is D: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to introduce the main topic to be discussed.
Criticism: 
  This answer reverses the order of the passages. Passage A actually comes before B.
  Also, while it is true that the Solnick and Hemenway study does introduce the topic of how people compare themselves to others, this is not the main topic discussed in either Passage A or Passage B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the paradox of wealth and happiness, how people compare themselves to others, and the phenomena of habituation and rivalry.
  Passage B discusses the theory that people use material wealth to show that they are successful and have created value, and that wanting to create value benefits society.
Thought: 
  Passage A mentions the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon, specifically how people compare themselves to others and the phenomenon of rivalry.
  Passage B mentions the study by Solnick and Hemenway to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided, specifically that people use material wealth to show they are successful and have created value.
  Therefore, the authors of each passage refer to the study for different purposes.
  The answer is C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided.
Criticism: 
  The descriptions of the purposes for which the study by Solnick and Hemenway is mentioned, while accurate, could also potentially apply to other aspects of the passages. 
  However, the authors each present specific perspectives and arguments that are supported by the study, making answer choice C the most appropriate. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The Solnick and Hemenway study was mentioned in both passages A and B.
  Passage A used the study to illustrate the importance of relative prosperity and how people view their income compared to others.
  Passage B used the study to support the idea that material wealth is used to show success and the desire to create value, rather than simply a desire for one-upmanship.
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A mentioned the Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for the importance of relative success when it comes to happiness.
  The authors of Passage B mentioned the same study to provide evidence for the idea that people use material wealth to demonstrate success and the desire to create value.
  The two passages use the study to support two different explanations for a similar phenomenon.
  Therefore, the answer is B: to present a view that will be argued against and to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Criticism: None.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about the controversial and evolving musical style of Arnold Schoenberg.
  Initial reactions to Schoenberg's music were negative.
  Schoenberg's music is divided into three different musical styles: late-Romantic, atonal, and 12-tone.
  In all three styles, Schoenberg demonstrated technical mastery.
  Schoenberg's music conveys recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the musical evolution of Arnold Schoenberg and his technical mastery, as well as how his music conveys emotional states that hadn't been captured by music before.
  The author also notes that, like Beethoven, some of Schoenberg's challenging works didn't become popular until well after their creation.
  The author concludes that if Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him.
  The main point of the passage seems to be that, despite the initial negative reactions to his music, Arnold Schoenberg's contributions to the expansion of music's expressive range and the evolution of musical style are worthy of admiration.
Therefore, the answer is C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
Response 1:

Thought:
  The passage primarily discusses Schoenberg's music and its reception over time.
  The author describes the different styles of Schoenberg's music and the technical mastery evident in all three.
  The author also suggests that Schoenberg's music is important because it expresses new emotional states that had not been recorded in music before.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that though Schoenberg's music has faced controversy, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and technical innovations.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the music of Arnold Schoenberg and how it evolved through three different musical styles.
  It mentions that his music was not well-received by many listeners.
  However, the author believes that Schoenberg's music is deserving of admiration for its expressive range and technical innovations.
Thought: 
  The author argues that even though Schoenberg's music has not always been well-received by listeners, it is still worthy of admiration for its expressive range and technical innovations.
  The details in the passage emphasize Schoenberg's contributions to the historical development of music, and his ability to precisely delineate recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  The author puts Schoenberg on a pedestal alongside Beethoven in terms of having a continually evolving musical style.
  Choice A is obviously not the main point of the passage since the author expresses no preference whether any of the listeners like the music or not. The author simply states the criticisms leveled against Schoenberg.
  Choice B is not accurate since the author does not compare Schoenberg to Beethoven; instead, they are mentioned in the same context as being composers who changed the language of music.
  Choice D is a very narrow description of Schoenberg's importance. While he did invent the 12-tone technique, the passage makes it clear that Schoenberg worked in multiple musical styles that each made big leaps in musical history.
  Choice E is a true statement about Schoenberg's slow acceptance but it is not the main point of the passage.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the music of Arnold Schoenberg and its characteristics.
  It notes that Schoenberg extended the expressive range of music and worked to bring a new system of order to nontonal music.

Thought:
  The main point of the passage is to convey the argument that Schoenberg's music is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations. 
  The passage acknowledges that Schoenberg's music has been challenging for some listeners, but it also notes that his work expresses emotional states that had not been recorded before. 
  The mention of Beethoven serves as a point of comparison rather than as a focus of the passage, and the discussion of recordings is also not central to the main point. 
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations. 
Criticism:
  The thought process above is accurate and captures the key points of the passage. 
  It could be noted that the passage does not argue that Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven, as option B suggests. 
  Option D focuses solely on Schoenberg's invention of the 12-tone technique and does not capture the broader argument of the passage. 
  Option A is partially correct in noting that some listeners find Schoenberg's music shrill and incoherent, but it does not capture the positive aspects of his work. 
  Option E is also somewhat accurate but focuses on a peripheral issue rather than the main point of the passage.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.
  B: It serves as the author's logical conclusion from data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development.
  C: It forms part of a speculative hypothesis that the author presents for its interest in relation to the main topic rather than as part of an argument.
  D: It serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.
  E: It forms part of the author's concession that certain factors complicate the argument presented in the first two paragraphs.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy
  D: conviction that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border
  B: a study focusing on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain
  C: an editorial in a contemporary newspaper from the Lower Rio Grande Border
  D: Lower Rio Grande Border

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology.
- The passage examines the modular theory of mind and argues against the idea that mental processes are decomposable into independent modules.
- The passage describes the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
Thought:
- The author argues against the idea of the modular theory of mind and raises concerns about the subtractive method used in FMRI.
- The author suggests that the subtractive method creates an illusion of neat functional localization that is not supported by their critique of the modular theory of mind.
- The author does not suggest that the subtractive method is invalid for all medical applications, but rather that its use in psychology should be reconsidered.
- The author does not suggest that the subtractive method proves that emotions are not seated in the amygdala.
- The author does not suggest that the view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use is a fundamental misconception.
Criticism:
- None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging, specifically the subtractive method, in psychology to study the modular theory of mind.
- The subtractive method involves taking a baseline measurement of the brain's activity and then subtracting it from the activity observed when the subject is performing cognitive tasks, with the difference assumed to represent the activity associated solely with the task at hand.

Thoughts:
- The author is critical of the modular theory of mind and argues that mental processes are likely to be properties of more general mental activity distributed throughout the brain, rather than distinct entities associated with specific brain regions.
- The author notes that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control and task conditions, which creates an illusion of functional localization that supports the modular theory of mind.

Evaluation:
- Option A is not supported by the passage, which does not suggest that the subtractive method produces invalid empirical results for medical applications.
- Option B is more in line with the author's argument that mental processes are likely properties of a more general mental activity, but the passage does not explicitly suggest that the subtractive method strongly supports this view.
- Option C is not stated in the passage. The author argues against the popular press claim that emotions are seated solely in the amygdala and notes that separating emotion from reason-giving "makes a hash of human experience," but this is not the same as saying that brain scans disprove the localization of emotions in the amygdala.
- Option D is a plausible interpretation of the passage. The author argues that the subtractive method creates an illusion of neat functional localization that supports the modular theory of mind, so this statement accurately reflects the author's view.
- Option E is not supported by the passage. The author does not suggest that there is a fundamental misconception of the subtractive method; instead, the author critiques the use of the method to support a modular theory of mind that may not accurately reflect the nature of mental activity.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology as a research method to investigate the modular theory of mind, which posits that mental activity can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules that are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The subtractive method is a technique used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) and involves subtracting a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought: 
  The author critiques the modular theory of mind and contends that the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  The author also critiques the subtractive method of FMRI, arguing that it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both control and task conditions and gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The author suggests that the view that the subtractive method supports the modular theory of mind is based on an illusion created by the subtractive method.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with statement D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to produce brain scans that reveal well-defined areas of metabolic activity in response to cognitive tasks.
  The passage argues that the validity of neuroimaging in psychology depends on the premise of the modular theory of mind, which holds that mental activity can be analyzed into distinct modules represented in localized brain regions, but may not accurately reflect the distributed nature of mental processes.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that the subtractive method used in FMRI creates an illusion of neat functional localization that supports the modular theory of mind, but actually obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both control and task conditions.
  While the passage does not state that the subtractive method's empirical results are invalid for medical applications, it does suggest that the use of FMRI to analyze mental activity is fundamentally different from its medical application in diagnosing physical conditions.
  Uttal's view that mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain is offered as a critique of the modular theory of mind, but the passage does not suggest that the subtractive method specifically supports this view.
  The passage argues against the claim that emotions are seated solely in the amygdala and reason solely in the prefrontal cortex, so it does not support the idea that the subtractive method shows emotions are not seated in the amygdala.
  The passage suggests that the subtractive method supports the modular theory of mind by creating an illusion of functional localization, so it does not argue that the subtractive method contradicts this theory.
  The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is presented in the passage as seemingly plausible, rather than fundamentally misconceived.
Evaluation:
  Based on the knowledge and thought processes outlined above, it seems that choice D is the best match to the author's stance and arguments in the passage.

Thought: 
  The subtractive method is used in functional magnetic resonance imaging.
  The FMRI is a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The subtractive method subtracts a baseline measurement and shows the resulting increase in brain activity while the subject performs a task.
  The entire brain is active in both the control and task conditions.
  Therefore, the subtractive method can create an illusion that brain functions are localized and is not indicative of distinct mental modules.
  Thus, the author may disagree with choice D that the subtractive method supports the modular theory of mind.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that the author would agree with or support answer choice B.
  There is no mention of brain scans of individuals experiencing anger in the passage, as mentioned in answer choice C.
  Answer choice E does not reflect the passage's description of the subtractive method.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
  The subtractive method involves taking a baseline measurement of brain activity, and then subtracting it from a second measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task.
  The resulting image is interpreted as showing the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task, not the entire brain activity.
Thought:
  The author criticizes the modular theory of mind because it assumes that mental activity can be analyzed into separate components, and that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions, which may not be the case.
  The author is skeptical that the subtractive method utilized by FMRI studies supports this premise, as the entire brain activity is not accounted for in the method.
  Therefore, the author would most likely reject choice D, which asserts that the subtractive method strongly supports the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion of localized brain function.
  Instead, the author argues that the subtractive method may obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, which contradicts the assumption that cognitive tasks are associated solely with the localized brain regions that "light up" in the scan.
  However, the author does not directly support any of the other choices.
Criticism:
  The author does not directly support any of the choices, but rather critiques assumptions made by the modular theory of mind and the subtractive method.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the use of brain scans in psychology and neuroscience research.
  The subtractive method involves taking a baseline measurement in a control condition and then subtracting it from a second measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task. 
Thought:
  The passage suggests that while the subtractive method is widely used and produces striking images of "neat functional localization," it is not a reliable way to localize mental processes.
  The author is critical of the modular theory of mind, which holds that the mind can be broken into distinct, localized modules.
  The author suggests that mental processes are distributed throughout the brain, and that the brain is active as a whole even during specific cognitive tasks.
  Although the subtractive method is used to support the idea of modular functions in the brain, the author feels that it obscures the complex nature of brain function and activity.
Conclusion: 
  The author is skeptical of the modular theory of mind and critical of the subtractive method's ability to accurately localize mental processes. Based on this, the author would most likely agree with Choice D, that the subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the subtractive method, which is used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to produce images of the brain at work. 
  The subtractive method involves taking a baseline measurement in a control condition and then subtracting that from the measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task. 
  The resulting image is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. 
Thought: 
  The author is critical of the modular theory of mind, which posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, and that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. 
  The author argues that this theory may not be valid, as the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. 
  The author also notes that the subtractive method used in FMRI obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and produces an illusion of neat functional localization. 
  Therefore, the author is unlikely to agree that the subtractive method strongly supports the modular theory of mind. 
  The author does not make any statements about medical applications of the subtractive method or about the relationship between the method and Uttal's view of mental processes. 
  The author also does not suggest that the subtractive method proves that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala. 
  Therefore, the best answer is E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging, particularly the subtractive method, in psychology to study modular theory of the mind.
  The subtractive method produces images of the brain that reveal well-defined areas that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks by taking a baseline measurement in the control condition and, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task before subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
Thought:
  The author critically evaluates the subtractive method and asserts that it is problematic because it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. The method creates an illusion of neat functional localization that supports the modular theory of mind, but it is not ultimately attractive because the brain is not decomposable into distinct and independent modules. Therefore, the author critiques the modular theory of mind and argues that the subtractive method does not support it.
  The author does not argue that the empirical results derived using the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications nor that it reveals that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity. The author also does not argue that brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala. The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is not based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and critiques the modular theory of mind.
  The subtractive method is a research method that produces brain images showing the metabolic activity associated with a cognitive task by subtracting a baseline measurement taken in a control condition from a measurement taken during the task.
Thought: 
  The passage introduces the subtractive method and critiques its use for validating the modular theory of mind. The author argues that the method gives a false impression of neat functional localization by subtracting out all the distributed brain functions. The author would not agree that the method invalidates empirical results for medical applications or that it supports Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity. The author also does not suggest that the method shows emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology as a research method and challenges the validity of the modular theory of mind, which posits that distinct modules of the mind are instantiated in localized brain regions. The passage also describes the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to produce images of brain activity.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind may not accurately reflect the organization of mental activity in the brain and challenges the belief that distinct components of the mind are localized in specific brain regions. However, it also acknowledges that brain scans do reveal well-defined areas of the brain that "light up" in response to certain cognitive tasks. It explains that the subtractive method used in FMRI produces images of differential brain activity that represent the metabolic activity associated solely with a cognitive task.
  Option A is contradicted by the passage, which calls into question the validity of the modular theory of mind and suggests that mental activity may be distributed throughout the brain rather than modular. 
  Option B is not supported by the passage, which does not claim that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have zero metabolic activity.
  Option C is supported by the passage, which describes the FMRI subtractive method as producing images of differential brain activity in response to cognitive tasks.
  Option D is not supported by the passage, which does not claim that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times, but rather that the entire brain is active in both control and task conditions.
  Option E goes beyond the information provided in the passage, which does not specify the regions of the brain that are activated in response to anger.
Criticism:
  Option C is the best answer because it accurately reflects the information provided in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology, specifically in relation to the modular theory of mind and the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
  FMRI maps the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain as a measure of metabolic activity and depicts the differential rate of oxygen use between the control and cognitive task conditions.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind may not be entirely valid, as mental processes are likely to be distributed throughout the brain rather than localized in independent modules.
  The passage describes the subtractive method of FMRI, which subtracts baseline measurements from on-task measurements to produce striking images of the brain at work.
  The passage does mention that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a higher rate of oxygen use.
  The passage does not suggest that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain, nor does it suggest that regions of the brain not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use close to zero or that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.
  The passage also does not specifically mention anger or any other emotion in relation to the subtractive method.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the use of brain scans in psychology and neuroscience research: specifically, it critiques the modular theory of mind, which assumes that mental processes can be decomposed into distinct modules, each located in a specific brain region; the author argues that such an assumption may be problematic. The passage also discusses one method of brain imaging—functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI)—and points out a problem with this method: that it tends to produce impressions of neat functional localization through the use of a subtractive method that obscures the fact that different brain functions are distributed throughout the brain.
Thought:
  According to the passage,
  A: The modular theory of mind is problematic because it assumes that mental processes can be decomposed into distinct modules, each located in a specific brain region, which may not necessarily be the case. Therefore, it is not supported by the passage.
  B: The modular theory of mind is not discussed in relation to the rate of oxygen use in the brain. Therefore, it is not supported by the passage.
  C: The passage suggests that FMRI produces images that reveal activity levels of certain brain regions for the performance of cognitive tasks. Therefore, this statement is supported by the passage.
  D: The passage discusses the baseline measurements of oxygen use, but not specifically whether some areas of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. Therefore, this statement is not supported by the passage.
  E: The passage mentions that the subtractive method shows the regions where metabolic activity is associated with the performance of specific cognitive tasks, including anger. Therefore, this statement is supported by the passage.
Criticism:
  The statement (C) is a reasonable summary of some of the points made in the passage about brain imaging, although it is not the only observation that the passage makes about brain scans. Moreover, the passage does not provide definitive answers to any of the questions it raises, but rather seeks to challenge the methods and assumptions commonly used in neuroscience and psychology research.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology and the modular theory of mind. 
  The modular theory of mind proposes that mental activity can be analyzed into distinct modules that are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is discussed as a way of depicting metabolic activity in specific regions of the brain during cognitive tasks.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind may not be a valid way to understand mental activity because mental processes are likely to be distributed throughout the brain.
  FMRI measures the rate of oxygen use in the brain, and the subtractive method is used to depict the differential rate of oxygen use associated with a cognitive task.
  The passage does not provide evidence to support options A, B, D, or E.
  Option C is supported by the passage because it describes the subtractive method used in FMRI to identify areas of the brain that are most metabolically active during certain cognitive tasks.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism of the validity of Option C in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity, particularly in relation to modular theory of mind and the subtractive method in FMRI.
  A: The passage does not provide strong support for this statement. While the modular theory of mind posits that there are distinct modules or components of the mind that are instantiated in localized brain regions, the passage presents a critique of this theory.
  B: The passage does not provide support for this statement. The passage describes the subtractive method used in FMRI, but makes no claims about the modular theory of mind regarding regions of the brain not engaged in specific cognitive tasks.
  C: The passage supports this statement. The passage describes the subtractive method used in FMRI to isolate metabolic activity associated solely with a specific cognitive task. The areas of the brain most metabolically active during the performing of the task are the ones that "light up" on the brain scan.
  D: The passage does not provide strong support for this statement. While the passage describes the baseline measurements taken for the subtractive method, it does not make any claims about the rate of oxygen use in specific brain regions at all times.
  E: The passage does not support this statement. While the passage acknowledges that the brain is active in different areas when a person is experiencing anger, it does not describe anger specifically, nor does it make any claims about which regions of the brain are involved in emotional experiences.
Thought: 
  The passage describes the subtractive method used in FMRI to isolate activity associated solely with specific cognitive tasks.
  The areas of the brain that are most metabolically active during these tasks light up on the brain scan.
  The passage does not provide support for statement A or B, and while statement D is partially true, it is not the best-supported statement in the passage.
  Statement E is also not supported by the passage, as emotional experiences are not discussed in detail.
  Therefore, statement C is the most strongly supported statement in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a way of understanding cognitive tasks and the modular theory of mind.
  The modular theory of mind suggests that mental activity can be analyzed into distinct modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  FMRI is a research method that uses a subtractive method to identify areas of increased metabolic activity during cognitive tasks.
Thought: 
  The passage highlights some problems with the modular theory of mind and its relationship with the use of brain scans as a research method.
  The passage describes how FMRI produces a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, with the assumption being that the differential rate of oxygen use identifies areas of the brain that are associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  Therefore, the most supported statement is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Criticism: 
  The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind is flawed and that mental processes are not decomposable into independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  Similarly, the passage suggests that the subtractive method used in FMRI produces striking images of the brain at work but may give a false impression of neat functional localization.
  Therefore, the use of brain scans to support the modular theory of mind may be questionable.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology that depends on the modular theory of mind.
  FMRI brain scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, and they are produced using a subtractive method.
  The modular theory of mind may be flawed because it depends on the idea that mental activity can be analyzed into separate modules, but mental processes may be distributed throughout the brain.
Thought:
  The passage describes the subtractive method used to produce brain scans that highlight areas of the brain with higher metabolic activity during cognitive tasks.
  The passage also critiques the modular theory of mind, which suggests that mental activity is composed of separate and independent modules that are located in specific regions of the brain.
  The critique suggests that mental activity may be more distributed throughout the brain.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Criticism:
  There is no strong evidence in the passage to support the claim that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain (A).
  The modular theory of mind does not suggest that regions of the brain not engaged in a task have a rate of oxygen use close to zero (B).
  The passage does not describe the baseline measurements of oxygen use for the subtractive method as showing that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times (D).
  The passage does not describe brain activity during experiences of anger (E).
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and the modular theory of mind.
  Brain scans are used as a research method in psychology, relying on the premise of the modular theory of mind.
  The modular theory of mind suggests that mental activity can be separated into distinct components, which are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The passage also discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
  FMRI measures the metabolic activity of different parts of the brain.
Thought:
  The modular theory of mind is called into question, as it may not be true that mental processes can be separated into distinct entities located in specific regions of the brain.
  The subtractive method used in FMRI shows a differential rate of oxygen use when a subject performs a cognitive task, but this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The areas of the brain that are most metabolically active during certain cognitive tasks are the one that "light up" in response to those tasks.
  The passage does not support the idea that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  The passage also does not support the idea that the rate of oxygen use in regions of the brain not engaged in a specific cognitive task is close to zero.
  The passage does not suggest that certain regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.
  The passage does mention anger as an example, but it does not provide evidence to support the idea that several regions of the brain are "lit up" with metabolic activity during the experience of anger.
Criticism:
  The statement "the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active during certain cognitive tasks are the one that 'light up' in response to those tasks" is true but it is not the most strongly supported statement by the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans (specifically FMRI) in psychology research.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise that underlies the use of neuroimaging in psychology. 
  William Uttal argues against the modular theory of mind, suggesting that mental processes are distributed throughout the brain rather than confined to specific modules. 
  The FMRI produces a map of oxygen use in different parts of the brain during cognitive tasks using a subtractive method.
Thought: 
  The modular theory of mind is a premise that underlies the use of neuroimaging in psychology.
  William Uttal argues that this premise may be incorrect and that mental processes are distributed throughout the brain. 
  The FMRI produces a map of oxygen use in different parts of the brain during cognitive tasks using a subtractive method.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions; the method produces striking images of the brain at work, and the modular theory of mind is ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method.
  Thus, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is: 
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the use of brain scans (specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging, or FMRI) in psychology to study the modular theory of mind.
- FMRI measures the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain and depicts differential rates of oxygen use between a control condition and a cognitive task.
Thought:
- The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind (which posits that mental activity can be broken down into separate, distinct modules located in specific regions of the brain) may not be valid.
- However, brain scans produced using the subtractive method do show well-defined areas "lighting up" in response to certain cognitive tasks.
- These scans depict differential rates of oxygen use, with the assumption being that the difference in oxygen use between a control condition and a cognitive task represents metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
- Therefore, the most supported statement is likely to be one that reflects the relationship between metabolic activity and cognitive tasks in brain scans produced using the subtractive method.
Criticism:
- Option A is not strongly supported by the passage, as the author suggests that the modular theory of mind may not be valid.
- Option B is not supported by the passage, which does not discuss the metabolic activity of brain regions not engaged in a specific cognitive task.
- Option D is not directly supported by the passage, as the baseline measurements of oxygen use mentioned are taken before a cognitive task is performed.
- Option E is not a generalizable statement and refers specifically to anger, which is not discussed in detail in the passage.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  In Passage A, the court upholds the reliability of fingerprint identification as evidence and defends the consistency and standards expected of fingerprint examiners.
  In Passage B, the author criticizes the lack of objective standards for identifying when fingerprints match and notes the lack of data on error rates in fingerprint identification.
Thought: 
  Passage A emphasizes the reliability of fingerprint identification and acknowledges that standards and consistency are important. 
  Passage B, on the other hand, criticizes the lack of objective standards in identifying matching fingerprints and notes the lack of data on error rates, suggesting that fingerprint identification may be less reliable than commonly believed.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification and the need for objective standards.
  Choices A, C, D, and E are not central issues in either passage and are unlikely to be points of disagreement between the authors.
  Choice B is the most likely point of disagreement since Passage A emphasizes the low error rate and reliability of fingerprint identification while Passage B questions the reliability and notes the lack of data on error rates.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification is a reliable form of evidence that has been used in criminal trials for 100 years.
  Passage A states that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification.

  The authors both acknowledge that errors can occur in fingerprint identification, but differ on how often these mistakes happen.
  Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification has a low error rate and that examiners undergo regular proficiency requirements.
  Passage B criticizes the lack of systematic study on the error rate and cites a study showing a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
  The passages do not discuss uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners.
  Both passages discuss the lack of a generally agreed-on standard for determining a match, but do not necessarily disagree on this point.
  Passage B advocates for a more holistic approach to identification, which is not addressed in Passage A.
  The authors disagree on the likelihood of a fingerprint examiner incorrectly declaring a match in a given criminal case.
  Passage A asserts that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate, while Passage B criticizes the lack of systematic study and cites a study showing a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
  Therefore, the answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
   - Passage A defends the use of fingerprint evidence in criminal trials and argues for its reliability and consistency.
   - Passage B criticizes the lack of objective standards for fingerprint identification, the inconsistent use of identification methods, and the absence of information about error rates in practice.
Thought: 
   - Passage A and B have different perspectives on fingerprint identification evidence.

  While different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. 
  An expert testified that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate.
  
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match."
  Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary.
  Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match.
  The error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match?
  A more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Thought:
  In Passage A, the author believes that fingerprint identification is reliable and experts have long concurred about its reliability.
  In contrast, Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match" and the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study.
  The authors would most likely disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification and the error rate for fingerprint identification.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree on the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate and has been reliable for 100 years, and that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification with uniform standards established through professional training and peer review.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match" and that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, and the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification is a reliable and consistent form of evidence, with objective standards and a low error rate.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards, and there is no consensus on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
  Although the authors have differing opinions on some aspects of fingerprint identification, they both appear to agree that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards, and there is room for improvement in the consistency and accuracy of fingerprint identification.
  However, they may differ in their opinions about the relative merits of the "points and characteristics" approach vs. the holistic approach, or whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A states that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for a long time and is reliable.
  Passage A also states that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification.
  Passage A asserts that there are established error rates revealing how often fingerprint examiners incorrectly identify a fingerprint as a particular person's.
  Passage A suggests that further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable.
  
  Passage B, on the other hand, suggests that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match".
  Passage B notes that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification.
  Passage B highlights that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match.
  Passage B states that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
  Passage B illustrates that different fingerprint examiners may use different methods and local practices vary.
Thought:
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B both discuss fingerprint identification but seem to hold different views.
  Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification is reliable and that there are established standards and error rates.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for identifying prints, and the error rate for fingerprint identification has not been systematically examined.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree about:
  - Whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law, as this is not discussed in either passage.
  - Whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match, as both passages agree on this point.
  - Whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable, as both passages favor uniform training.
  - Whether the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification, as Passage A suggests that examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach.
  - The likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case, as Passage A suggests that the error rates for fingerprint identification have been established and that it has withstood the test of time, while Passage B argues that the error rate has not been systematically studied and that different factors (such as the number of identifying characteristics shared) affect the likelihood of a match. 
  
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the defendant's challenge to fingerprint evidence and the court's decision to uphold its reliability despite the lack of scientific law status and certain inconsistencies in standards.
  Passage B criticizes the lack of objective standards in fingerprint identification and highlights concerns about the error rate and efficacy of the point-counting method.
Thought:
  The authors seem to disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification evidence.
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification evidence has ably withstood the test of time and upholds its reliability despite certain inconsistencies in standards, while Passage B criticizes the lack of objective standards, highlights concerns about the error rate, and argues that the point-counting method is not effective.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification evidence.
  Among the choices, B and D relate to reliability, but B refers to the likelihood of error, whereas D is about the method of identification.
  A and E are mentioned in Passage A, but Passage B does not address them.
  C is not discussed by either passage.
  Thus, the best answer is D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification.
Criticism:
  While it is true that the authors disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification evidence, specifically the lack of objective standards, error rate, and efficacy of the point-counting method, the question asks about their disagreement regarding the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods.
  Therefore, the best answer might be E instead because both passages discuss variations in standards and degrees of correlation required for examiners to declare a match, and Passage B criticizes the point-counting method used by some examiners, while neither passage explicitly supports the holistic method.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been reliably used in criminal trials for over 100 years and that experts agree on its reliability.
  Passage B argues that there is no consensus on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification or on a generally accepted standard for determining when to declare a match. There is no definitive answer to the likelihood of two people sharing fingerprint characteristics, and there has been little systematic study of the error rate of fingerprint identification.
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B provide different perspectives on the reliability of fingerprint identification and the uniformity of standards for fingerprint examiners.
  Passage A generally defends the reliability of fingerprint identification by asserting that it has had a "low error rate" and has "withstood the test of time." 
  Passage B casts doubt on the reliability of fingerprint identification by noting that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match and that there is no consensus on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. 
  Both passages agree that there is no definitive answer to the likelihood of two people sharing fingerprint characteristics. 
  Both passages touch on the topic of uniformity in fingerprint identification standards to some degree, but they do not fundamentally disagree about the desirability of uniformity.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case, which is the subject of Passage B but not of Passage A.
  The answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Criticism:
  None
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A defends fingerprint evidence as reliable, citing experts' agreement on its reliability despite lack of scientific law status and minor variation in correlation requirements among different agencies.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards, there is no consensus on basis of identification or when to declare a match, and the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study.
Thought:
  The authors agree that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study. However, they differ on whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable and the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A defends the use of fingerprint evidence based on its reliability over a century of use and the establishment of uniform, objective standards and testing requirements for fingerprint examiners.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating if two prints "match," citing the varied practices and lack of consensus on standards for identification and error rates.
Thought: 
  The authors seem to have different views on the utility and reliability of fingerprint identification.
  Passage A defends fingerprint identification as a reliable tool, citing the long history of use, uniform testing requirements, and high standards.
  Passage B critiques fingerprint identification as lacking objective standards and consensus on identifying matching prints, and argues that error rates are unknown.
  Therefore, the authors are most likely to disagree about whether fingerprint identification is a reliable forensic tool or not.
  Choice C is about the legal status of fingerprint identification, which is not the main point of disagreement between the authors.
  Choices A, B, D, and E are all issues related to the reliability of fingerprint identification.
Criticism: 
  Overall, the thought process is accurate, but it can be more specific. 
  The authors do not necessarily disagree on whether fingerprint identification is a reliable tool, but rather on the extent of its reliability and the uniformity of standards for identifying matching prints.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  C: A work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  D: The best works of art improve with age.
  E: Some forms of art are superior to others.
Response 0:
Answer: A ("A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.")

Explanation:
The passage discusses the parallels between creating art and creating perfumes and argues that perfumes should be taken more seriously as an art form. The author notes that perfumers, like painters, create an "imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter," and that both can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that they evoke. Specifically, the author writes that perfumers "are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas" and that both can help us "discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience." This suggests that a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes. Therefore, the correct answer is A ("A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes").  

While the passage discusses the "harmonious combination of many small sensations" that occurs in both art and perfume, this is not the main point or argument of the passage, so choice B is incorrect. The passage does not argue that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success, so choice C is incorrect. The passage notes that oil paintings become more transparent over time, but it does not argue that these paintings improve with age over time, so choice D is incorrect. The passage does not make any definitive statement about whether some forms of art are superior to others, so choice E is also incorrect.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfume making as sister arts.
  Painters use natural and synthetic pigments and media to create works of art while perfumers use natural and synthetic chemical compounds to create fragrances.
  The skill and complexity involved in creating fragrances is on par with creating works of art.
  Perfumes are undervalued because large corporations often tamper with formulas to increase profits, leading to a decline in the quality of fine perfume.
Thought: 
  The article establishes the parallels between painting and perfume making.
  It is said that fine perfumes are undervalued due to the actions of large corporations, which has led to a decline in the quality of fine perfume.
  There is no evidence to support statements A, C, D, or E.
  The passage does suggest that there is a combination of many small sensations that make up a work of art, which supports statement B.
Conclusion: 
  Based on the passage, the answer is B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the similarities between painting and perfumery.
  Both painting and perfumery involve combining natural and synthetic materials to create a work of art.
  The painter builds up the surface through layers of paint, while the perfumer builds up olfactory sensations through the combination of chemical compounds.
  Both painting and perfumery can evoke memories and create an aesthetic experience.
Thought:
  The passage supports the idea that a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  It also supports the idea that in painting and perfumery, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  The passage does criticize the practice of tampering with perfumes to make them cheaper and increase profits, so it can be inferred that creating a work of art for the sake of commercial success is not ideal.
  The passage does not provide support for the idea that the best works of art improve with age.
  The passage does not make any comparisons or judgements about the superiority of different forms of art.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Answer: A 

Explanation: 
The passage discusses the similarities between painting and creating scents, suggesting that both can bring about powerful aesthetic experiences. The author notes that painters and perfumers both use a combination of natural and synthetic materials to create their works, carefully building up layers to achieve a desired effect. In particular, the passage notes that perfumers can create an "imaginary world" that is just as powerful as a painting or symphony, and that they do so by evoking memories and experiences through the sense of smell. Therefore, the passage provides the most support for the idea that A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes. The other options are not directly supported by the passage.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfume.
  The author argues that perfumers, like painters, carefully combine various elements to produce an artistic product.
  The passage suggests that large corporations undervalue and dilute the art of perfume for commercial reasons.
Thought: 
  The passage does not suggest that any one form of art is superior or inferior to another.
  The author argues that great perfume should be taken more seriously and that it can be appreciated similarly to great painting or music.
  The passage suggests that art created for commercial success may be diluted.
  The author argues that art (including perfume) is able to bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  The author argues that a great perfumer can create an imaginary world that is powerful and intimate, similar to a great painter or composer.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Criticism: 
  None apparent.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Answer: A ("A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.")

Explanation:
The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfumery as forms of art, and it suggests that perfumery is often undervalued despite its potential for creating powerful and intimate sensory experiences. The author notes that the "talented 'noses'" who create perfumes work with olfactory elements to produce combinations that can evoke memories and experiences in much the same way that painters create illusions of life on canvas. The passage suggests that perfumes, like paintings, have the potential to bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that they evoke. Therefore, the choice that provides the most support for this idea is A: "A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes."
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between the art of oil painting and the art of perfume making.
  The author argues that the development and combination of olfactory elements by a perfumer can be considered a form of artistic creation similar to that of a painter or composer.
Thought: 
  The passage provides the most support for the statement that a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes, as it suggests that perfumers create imaginary worlds that can evoke memories and experiences.
  The passage also suggests that such creations can be considered a form of artistic expression, further supporting this statement.
  Therefore, the answer is A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide any direct support for statements B, C, D, or E.
  While the passage does suggest that perfumers and painters both combine elements to create their works, it does not directly support statement B regarding the harmonious combination of sensations.
  The passage also does not specifically address the relationship between commercial success and artistic merit, and it does not provide direct support for statement C.
  While the passage discusses the changes that occur in an oil painting over time, it does not provide direct support for the idea that the best works of art improve with age, so statement D is not supported.
  Finally, the passage does not make any value judgments about different forms of art, so statement E is not supported.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage compares painting and perfumery as sister arts.
  Painters and perfumers both work with natural and synthetic elements to create their art.
  Painters and perfumers both create illusions of life, by building up their work in layers.
  Perfumers create a symphonic combination of olfactory elements to produce many small sensations.
  Fine perfumes are undervalued and ill-served by marketing.
Thought: 
  The passage makes a comparison between painting and perfumery.
  It highlights the similarities between how painters build up a painting and how perfumers build up a perfume - both creating an illusion of life.
  The passage argues that perfumes are undervalued and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
  The passage does not compare one form of art as superior to the other.
  The passage does not suggest that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for commercial success.
  The passage does suggest that a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through memories that it evokes.
  The passage also refers to the combination of many small sensations in a work of art.
  Therefore, the best-supported statement is A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to support the idea that a work of art is a failure if it is created for commercial success.
  While the passage highlights the combination of many small sensations in a perfume, this does not necessarily apply to all forms of art.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the parallels between the art of painting and the art of creating perfume.
  The author suggests that perfumers, like artists, create an imaginary world that can evoke memories or experiences in the audience.
Thought: 
  The passage implies that both painting and perfume can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories or experiences they evoke in the audience.
  Therefore, A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes is the most supported statement.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the similarities between the art of painting and the art of perfume-making.
  The passage argues that great perfumes are not taken as seriously as other art forms.
Thought: 
  The passage provides the most support for the following statement:
  Great perfumes are a legitimate form of art that can create an aesthetic experience through a symphonic combination of olfactory elements that evoke memories or emotions, similar to the way paintings and music can.
  The passage argues that perfumes are undervalued because large corporations distribute them and tamper with their formulas for profit, and perfume is ill-served by marketing and public relations.
  Thus, the aesthetic value of perfume is not widely recognized, despite its similarity to other art forms.
  None of the other answer choices are directly supported by the passage.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses "stealing thunder" as a courtroom strategy that involves a lawyer revealing negative information about a client before it is revealed or elicited by the opposing lawyer as a means of gaining credibility as well as controlling the message and framing the evidence in a positive light. The passage presents several psychological explanations for why the technique works. 
Thought:
  Stealing thunder involves revealing negative information about a client before it is disclosed by the opposing counsel.
  Early disclosure of negative information can create an image of credibility and provide jurors with impetus for critical assessment.
  People who reveal information against their own best interest are perceived as more credible and persuasive.
  Effective use of stealing thunder depends on how it is framed.
  None of the choices presents a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Criticism:
  Your assessment is correct.
  None of the choices presents a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder. 
  Thus, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author explains that lawyers believe that if a weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, then that weakness should be volunteered before it is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. 
  The author contends that stealing thunder may work because of a few factors:
    1. Volunteering information early may create an image of credibility.
    2. The technique may provide jurors with an impetus for critical assessment.
    3. A persuasive message will increase in value and effectiveness if it is seen as scarce.
    4. The lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance.
Thought:
  The question is asking us for a factor that contributes to the success of the stealing thunder strategy. 
  Among the factors mentioned, there is nothing about the careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time, superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message, or lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings.
  Jurors’ desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing is mentioned in the text as a factor that probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder, because it suggests they are eager to solidify their position regarding the case. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.
Criticism:
  There is no significant criticism of this answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses stealing thunder being an effective strategy in certain circumstances.
  The strategy involves voluntarily revealing negative information about a client before it can be revealed by an opposing lawyer.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses several factors that may contribute to the success of the stealing thunder strategy, including:
  - Revealing damaging information early creates an image of credibility and persuasiveness.
  - Previewing testimony that the opposition plans to present can provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment.
  - Early exposure to negative information may frame jurors' perceptions in a certain way that influences their analysis of subsequent trial information.
  Therefore, the answer must be one of options that reflect these factors.
  Options A, B, C, and E are not mentioned in the passage and can be eliminated.
  Option D is supported by the passage, as jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case could motivate them to use the early framing provided by stealing thunder throughout the rest of the trial.
  Therefore, the answer is D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the potential effectiveness of the courtroom strategy called "stealing thunder," but does not mention careful timing as a factor.
  The passage suggests that jurors' initial impressions of the trial are important and can be influenced by positive framing of negative information ("putting a spin" on the information), potentially contributing to the success of stealing thunder. 
  The passage does not mention superior skill in assessing jurors or screening them prior to the trial as factors in the success of stealing thunder.
Thought:
  The author implies that one factor contributing to the success of stealing thunder is the ability to frame negative information positively and "put a spin" on it.
  The author also notes that jurors often use early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of trial information, which could reinforce the value of stealing thunder as a strategy.
  None of the other answer choices are directly supported by the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the ability to frame negative information positively is a factor mentioned in the passage; however, none of the answer choices directly mentions this factor.
  While the passage does suggest that jurors' initial impressions of the trial are important and can be influenced by positive framing of negative information, it does not necessarily follow that jurors have a "desire" to arrive at a firm view.
  Nonetheless, the correct answer choice is still the most likely answer based on the information presented in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Stealing thunder is a courtroom strategy that involves revealing negative information about a client before it is revealed by the opposition.
  According to the passage, stealing thunder may be effective because:
    -It creates an image of credibility.
    -It alerts jurors to testimony that the opposition plans to present.
    -It frames the negative evidence positively.
    -It can make the evidence brought by both sides ("old news") and therefore less valuable in jurors' minds.
Thought: 
  The passage explains that stealing thunder may be effective because it alerts jurors to testimony that the opposition plans to present; it may make the evidence brought by both sides ("old news") and therefore less valuable in jurors' minds.
  So, the answer is D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a legal strategy called "stealing thunder," which involves revealing negative information about a client before an opposing lawyer has a chance to do so.
  The passage suggests several reasons why this strategy may be effective, including the potential for gaining credibility, the potential for creating an impetus for critical assessment, the potential for making persuasive information appear scarce and valuable, and the potential for framing evidence positively.
Thought:
  The question asks which factor "probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder."
  Of the choices provided, the one that seems most relevant is D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.
  The passage suggests that stealing thunder may work by providing jurors with an impetus for critical assessment, which may help them arrive at a more solidified view of the case.
  Additionally, the passage notes that jurors may be more resistant to persuasive attempts if they are warned ahead of time, and may value persuasive information more if it is perceived as scarce or exclusive.
  None of the other choices seem directly related to the discussion of stealing thunder in the passage.
  While timing may be important for the success of the strategy, the passage does not specify that it needs to be done within a short time frame.
  Similarly, while lawyers may be skilled at assessing jurors, the passage does not discuss this as a factor in the effectiveness of stealing thunder.
  The willingness of clients to testify about their past mistakes is not directly related to the topic of stealing thunder, and the screening of jurors is not discussed in relation to the strategy's success.
Criticism:
  The thought process seems correct, and there are no obvious flaws in the reasoning.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy where a lawyer reveals negative information about a client before it is revealed by an opposing lawyer.
- Lawyers believe that if the negative information is likely to be revealed by the opposing party, it should be volunteered.
- Volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility.
- Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. 
- Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present.
- Frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance.
- Jurors are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case.
Thought: 
- The question asks us which one of the following contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
- Option A mentions careful timing of thunder-stealing message, but the text doesn't state this as a factor contributing to the success of stealing thunder.
- Option B mentions some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' reactions to a message. This could be a factor in the success of stealing thunder but it's not mentioned in the text.
- Option C mentions a willingness to testify in person about their own past mistakes. This is not related to stealing thunder strategy's success.
- Option D mentions jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing, which is in line with the text's explanation that jurors are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case, and they can be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information.
- Option E mentions lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors but this is not related to stealing thunder strategy's success.
Criticism: 
- The text explains some factors that contribute to the success of stealing thunder. 
- Options A and B are not mentioned in the text.
- Option C is not related to stealing thunder.
- Option D is in line with the text's explanation.
- Option E is not related to stealing thunder.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Stealing thunder is a courtroom strategy where a lawyer volunteers negative information about their client before the opposing lawyer elicits it.
  The technique may be effective because it creates an impression of credibility, alerts juries to the opposition's testimony, and allows the lawyer to shape the story in a positive way.
  The effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials is not known, but studies involving simulated trial situations suggest it is effective.
Thought: 
  The question asks for a factor that probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
  The passage states that stealing thunder may create an impression of credibility and may allow the lawyer to shape the story in a positive way.
  Based on this information, one likely factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder is jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.
  Jurors may be eager to cling to the first information they hear, and if that information is framed positively, they may use it to guide their subsequent analysis of trial information.
  Therefore, the answer is D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not mention careful timing, lawyers' skill in assessing jurors, clients' willingness to testify, or careful screening of jurors as factors that contribute to the success of stealing thunder.
  It is possible that these factors could contribute to the effectiveness of stealing thunder, but the passage does not provide support for that.
  However, the passage does suggest that stealing thunder may be successful if the negative information can be framed positively, so another possible answer could be E: lawyers' careful framing of the negative information.
  However, the passage also suggests limitations on the use of the technique when the information is very damaging and creates an early negative impression.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage talks about the effectiveness of "stealing thunder" as a courtroom strategy where a lawyer reveals negative information about his own client before it is revealed by the opposing lawyer. The author mentions several factors that can contribute to the effectiveness of this strategy. 

A: The passage does not mention anything about the timing of the thunder-stealing message.
B: The passage does not mention anything about a lawyer's skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message.
C: The passage does not mention anything about a client's willingness to testify in person about their own past mistakes.
D: The passage mentions that jurors are eager to solidify their position regarding the case, and that early positive framing can guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information, which suggests that this is a factor that can contribute to the success of stealing thunder.
E: The passage does not mention anything about lawyers' screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings.

Thought: 
  The passage discusses several factors that can contribute to the success of stealing thunder.
  Jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing is mentioned as one such factor.
  Therefore, D could be the answer.
Criticism:
  The passage mentions several other factors that could contribute to the success of stealing thunder, such as creating an image of credibility, providing juries with an impetus for critical assessment, and framing the evidence positively.
  However, none of these factors is mentioned as an answer choice.
   Additionally, the passage also discusses limitations on the use of the technique.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. 
  The effectiveness of this strategy is supported by several psychological explanations.
Thought: 
  The question asks about a factor that, in some instances, probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder according to the author. 
  According to the passage, a persuasive message will increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce.
  Stealing thunder may create an image of credibility that is persuasive to a jury.
  The technique provides juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present.
  Stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance.
  Early positive framing can guide jurors' subsequent analysis of the trial information.
  Limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors.
  Based on this, the most likely answer is D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.
Criticism: 
  None.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.
  D: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he condueted.
  E: Though he composed and condueted primarily jazz, he also composed some music of other genres.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the development of literary works that drew inspiration from music, particularly jazz music, and focuses on Toni Morrison's novel Jazz as an example.
  It describes how Morrison used a narrative style that was similar to the structure of jazz music, in which individual performances are intertwined with an ensemble sound.
  The passage mentions Duke Ellington as a composer and conductor who created music that was composed with his specific individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind.
Thought: 
  The passage presents Duke Ellington as an example of a composer who created compositions that were composed with each of his musicians' unique "voices" in mind. 
  This idea is presented as analogous to the style of narration that Morrison uses in Jazz, in which individual voices are woven into a larger narrative structure. 
  The passage does not explicitly state that Morrison was inspired by Ellington, but it suggests that the two share a similar approach to composition, so it is possible that she was influenced by him.
  Answer choices B, C, and E are not supported by the passage.
  Answer choice A is the best answer, as it is the most plausible statement given the information provided in the passage and the similarities drawn between Ellington's approach to music composition and Morrison's approach to narration.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of a new type of pathogen called prions that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which is degenerative neurological condition.
  CJD is fatal and there is no therapy for it.
  Prions are protein based and reproduce themselves in an unexpected way by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal pathogenic conformation.
  Prions are considered a new class of infectious pathogen because they contain no genetic material.

  Prions are new type of protein pathogen that lacks nucleic acid.
  Prions exist naturally in the body as proteins and are capable of converting themselves into a dangerous abnormal shape.
  Abnormal prions propagates and accumulates in the body, leading to degenerative conditions.
  Research into the cause of CJD has led to the discovery of prions.
Thought: 
  The passage provides a detailed description of prions and how they cause degenerative conditions, including CJD.
  The passage is not discussing other types of proteins or mechanisms of protein reproduction in detail.
  The main point of the passage is that prions are a new type of protein pathogen that reproduces without genetic material and is responsible for degenerative conditions like CJD.
  Choice A is not accurate because it is not the main point of the passage and it only talks about general protein production and not prions specifically.
  Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not directly support the claim that prions are responsible for most degenerative neurological conditions.
  Choice D is incorrect because it only discusses the initial reaction to the discovery of prions and not the main point of the passage.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
Criticism: 
  The main point of the passage is that prions are a new type of protein pathogen, reproducing without genetic material, that is responsible for CJD, among other conditions.

  Prions are responsible for CJD and other degenerative neurological conditions, and while they occur naturally in the body as proteins, they have the ability to cause significant harm when they reproduce abnormally.
  The main point of the passage is therefore that the discovery of prions has led to a new understanding of the nature of infectious pathogens and their ability to reproduce themselves.
  Thus, the best answer is B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage explores the discovery of prions as a new class of protein pathogens that are capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material, causing deadly degenerative neurological diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The passage also mentions the initial skepticism within the scientific community regarding this discovery and notes the possibility of prions being responsible for other degenerative neurological conditions. Out of all the options, choice B best expresses the main point of the passage. Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of the "prion," a new type of protein pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  Experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively of protein.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is about the discovery of the "prion," a new type of protein pathogen that causes CJD.
  Prions are unique in that they are capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. 
  There are still many unknowns about how prions reproduce and cause cellular destruction, but their discovery has opened up new areas of research into other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism
- The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material
- Recently, a new type of pathogen called "prion" has been discovered that lacks nucleic acid and consists mainly, if not exclusively, of protein
- Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, so the body does not produce an immune response when they are present
- Prions have the ability to reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation
- The abnormal prions destroy nerve cells in the brain and can lead to degenerative neurological conditions such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)

Thought:
- The passage discusses the discovery of prions, a new type of pathogen that lacks genetic material and can cause degenerative neurological conditions such as CJD
- The main point of the passage is that prions are a new type of protein pathogen that can replicate and cause disease in unexpected ways, and may be responsible for other degenerative neurological conditions as well

Evaluation:

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use
  D: detectable using brain scans enhanced by means of the subtractive method
  E: features of a general mental activity that is spread throughout the brain

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses recent findings in neuroscience and how they suggest a shift in the way we think about the law, focusing on deterring future harm instead of retribution-based punishment.
  Passage B discusses the philosophical concept of free will coexisting with determinism and distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that all behavior is caused by the physical operations of the brain and that people may be deluding themselves into thinking they are making a free and rational moral choice when their decisions are actually driven by emotional centers in the brain. As a result, the law should focus on deterring future harm rather than punishing bad people.
  Passage B discusses the philosophical concept of free will coexisting with determinism, distinguishing between free actions and constrained actions that are caused by external sources.
  Passage B's argument centers around the idea that the source of a cause determines whether an action is free, while Passage A does not discuss this concept.
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that a person's behavior is caused by the operations of their brain and that neuroscience necessitates that the criminal-justice system shift from retribution to deterrence.
  Passage B discusses the coexistence of free will with determinism using the concept of soft determinism and makes the analogy that actions and wills originating from a disease-free brain are free and unconstrained.
Thought:
  Passage A discusses the idea that free and rational moral choice may be delusional and that the focus of the law should be on deterrence.
  Passage B argues for the coexistence of free will and determinism using the concept of soft determinism and distinguishes between free and constrained actions.
  Mental disorder is a concept that plays a role in both passages as it is mentioned in passage B with respect to constrained actions and in passage A with respect to the idea that rational choice may be delusional.
  Free choice is a concept discussed in both passages in different contexts.
  Causality is central to both passages and forms the basis for discussion of neuroscience in passage A and determinism in passage B.
  Self-delusion is discussed in passage A as a possibility for individuals making free and rational moral choices, but not in the argument of passage B.
  Moral responsibility is discussed in passage A as part of the dominant justification of punishment in the criminal-justice system and is not explicitly mentioned in the argument of passage B.
  Therefore, the concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B, but not in that of passage A, is D: self-delusion.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that one's brain is solely responsible for behavior and that people can trick themselves into believing that they are making rational choices when they are actually not. Therefore, retribution should be abandoned in favor of deterrence. 
  Passage B argues that one can still act freely even in a deterministic world using the concept of "soft determinism." Ayer distinguishes between free actions caused by internal sources and constrained actions caused by external sources.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues in favor of deterrence and against retribution since our actions are controlled by our brains and we can trick ourselves into believing we are making free choices. It does not discuss the concept of constrained actions or the source of the cause of an action.
  Passage B also argues that free choice can coexist with determinism through the concept of soft determinism. It distinguishes between free actions caused by internal sources and constrained actions caused by external sources. 
  Mental disorder is mentioned in Passage B but not in a significant way that relates to the overall argument. 
  Causality is mentioned in both passages, but Passage B focuses more on how determinism affects free will.
  Self-delusion is only mentioned in Passage A but does not play a role in Passage B.
  Moral responsibility is mentioned indirectly in Passage A through the concept of retribution but is not mentioned in Passage B.
  Therefore, the concept that plays a role in the argument of Passage B but not in that of Passage A is B: free choice. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the idea that a person's behavior is caused by the operations of the brain.
  Neuroscience findings suggest that people are not always aware of their own motivations.
  The criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishment.
  Passage B discusses the idea of free will and determinism.
  Ayer distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
Thought:
  Passage A focuses on the idea that people are not always aware of their own motivations and that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concepts of free will and determinism, and Ayer distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
  The key concept in passage B that is not discussed in Passage A is the concept of "constrained actions," which are actions caused by external sources, such as someone or something forcing an individual to act a certain way.
  Therefore, the answer is A: mental disorder.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that behavior is exclusively determined by the brain, and therefore moral responsibility is not a useful concept when punishing criminals.
  Passage B argues that free choice can coexist with determinism, and that actions are free as long as they are not constrained by an external cause. 
  A: Passage A mentions mental disorders as a possible cause of behavior, while passage B discusses constrained actions in the context of mental disorders such as hypnosis or kleptomania
  B: Passage B argues that actions can be free if they are caused by internal sources and not constrained. Passage A argues against the concept of free and rational moral choice, due to the potential influence of external factors on brain functions.
  C: Both passages discuss causality in the context of brain processes causing behavior.
  D: Passage A discusses the possibility of self-delusion when making moral choices, while passage B does not mention it.
  E: Passage A argues against moral responsibility as a useful concept in criminal justice, while passage B discusses the concept of free will in decision making. 
Thought: 
  Passage B argues in favor of the concept of free choice, while Passage A argues against it.
  Mental disorders such as hypnosis and kleptomania are mentioned in Passage B, but not in Passage A.
  Therefore, the concept that plays a role in Passage B but not A is mental disorder.
  The answer is A: mental disorder
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
  The answer is A: mental disorder.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:

Thought:
  Passage A argues that the law should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing people for their freely chosen immoral acts.
  Passage B discusses the possibility that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, proposing a theory of soft determinism.
  Both passages discuss causality and the role of the brain in human behavior.
  Passage A discusses the possibility of self-delusion, where people may believe they are making a free and rational moral choice but it actually correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain.
  Passage B discusses the possibility of mental disorders as a cause of constrained actions.
  The concept of free choice is discussed in both passages.
  Therefore, the concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A is A: mental disorder.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution.
  Passage A argues that the activity of certain brain centers may affect what people believe to be free moral choices.
  Passage B argues that a person can still act freely in a deterministic world.
  Passage B distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that retribution should be abandoned in the criminal-justice system because people may not be truly exercising free will.
  Passage B has a discussion about the concept of free will.
  The concept of constrained action is discussed in Passage B, but not in A.
  Among the choices, only choice B: free choice is discussed in Passage B but not in Passage A.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that behavior is solely determined by the operations of the brain and that free and rational choices may be illusory.
  The passage proposes that because of this, the criminal-justice system should focus on deterrence instead of retribution.
  Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will. The philosopher Ayer argues for soft determinism and distinguishes between free and constrained actions.
Thought:
  Neither passage refers to mental disorders.
  Passage A argues that free and rational choices may be false; this is an argument about free will, which is explicitly discussed in Passage B.
  Passage B argues that free actions are those that are caused by internal sources and constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources; B engages causality in its argument about determinism and free will.
  Passage A argues against retribution, and so it deals with the concept of moral responsibility.
  Self-delusion is a concept that Passage A explicitly mentions.
  Therefore, the concept that could play a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A is free choice (choice B).
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains how neuroscientific findings affects our understanding of law and advocates for deterring future harms instead of retributions.
  Passage B discusses Alfred J. Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" which argues that people can still act freely in a deterministic world. He distinguishes between free and constrained actions.
Thought:
  Passage A argues that people may be deluding themselves and that neuroscience's findings challenges idea of free and rational moral choice.
  Passage B talks about Ayer's theory of free and constrained actions which argues that people can act freely as long as the actions are not constrained.
  Mental disorder, causality, self-delusion, and moral responsibility are mentioned in both passages.
  Free choice is mentioned in Passage B but not Passage A as the author argues that actions can be free or constrained.
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.
Criticism:
  The answer and thought seem logically sound.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the scientific discoveries related to nuclear fission, which occurred in the 1930s.
  The Italian physicists first bombarded uranium with neutrons in 1934.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
  Before this discovery, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
Thought: 
  According to the given passage, physics community was not receptive to the possibility of atoms being split when uranium was bombarded with neutrons.
  Earlier some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
  Therefore, the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  A is the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, the means by which atomic nuclei can be split.
  Between 1934 and 1939, scientists compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission without recognizing what they were witnessing, until exiled physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  Earlier, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms.
Thought: 
  The passage does not suggest that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments (A), as it specifically references earlier theoretical calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
  The passage does describe how it took some time for researchers to recognize the significance of the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium (E). However, the correct answer choice will describe the community's views on the matter, not their difficulties in identifying the by-products.
  The passage does not indicate that the physics community reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split (B). The earlier theoretical calculations suggesting that in principle it should be possible did not seem to have played a role in the research.
  The passage does state that uranium was not targeted for achieving the splitting of atoms (D).
  Overall, the passage suggests that the physics community was not initially receptive to the possibility of atomic nuclei being split. It mentions the common view that a neutron’s breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse. Therefore, the correct answer is not any of the choices.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The discovery of a means to split atoms took place between 1934 and 1939.
  Scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing it.
  Some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it was possible to split atoms apart.
  Neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission.
  Scientists were not receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission happening in that context.
Thought: 
  The physics community during the 1930s was researching nuclear fission.
  Earlier theoretical developments that indicated that atoms could be split apart were ignored.
  Experiments in neutron-bombardment were not aimed at nuclear fission but were inconclusive, and the researchers were not attuned to the possibility of its occurrence.
  Therefore, it is likely that option A is correct and that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Criticism:
  The passage did not explicitly state that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments. 
  In fact, the passage did not mention option D - "It showed that uranium atoms were the easiest to split" - at all.
  The remaining options are not mentioned in the passage, either.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
The physics community during the 1930s discovered nuclear fission, the means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split. Between 1934 and 1939, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing. Earlier, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that atomic nuclei could be broken apart.
D: It showed that uranium atoms were the easiest to split is incorrect and contradictory to the passage. During the 1930s, scientists compiled increasing evidence about nuclear fission without any expectations they were witnessing it. So, scientists could not have determined that uranium was the easiest to split.
E: It recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances is incorrect. The passage mentions that precise chemical analyses were hampered by the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, such as uranium, but there is no reference to recognition or discussions by the scientific community of their danger during this time.
Analysis: 
The correct answer should be an option that suggests the community's approach towards their discovery of nuclear fission. Based on the passage, while some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that atomic nuclei could be broken apart, the physics community during the 1930s failed to recognize the significance of the evidence they had compiled. So, the answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Scientists had been compiling evidence to indicate nuclear fission, but the concept had not yet been acknowledged.
  Lise Meitner provided crucial theoretical connections to understand nuclear fission.
Thought:
  The passage doesn't mention any mistaken evaluations of theoretical developments or calculations.
  The passage does discuss the difficulty scientists had identifying the by-products of neutron bombardment.
  The passage doesn't indicate that uranium atoms were the easiest to split.
  The passage does mention the dangers associated with working with highly radioactive materials.
  The correct answer must therefore be either C or E.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The article describes how important developments in nuclear physics were missed for a long time before their significance was finally recognized and understood.
  A: The passage does not say that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: Theoretical calculations indicating that atoms could be split were not reevaluated, but rather provided important groundwork for the eventual discovery of nuclear fission.
  C: The passage states that scientists did in fact produce evidence of the by-products of neutron bombardment, but failed to recognize their significance.
  D: The passage does not suggest that uranium atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: The passage does mention the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but does not focus on the community's recognition of those dangers.
Thought:
  The author describes how scientists compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission without recognizing its significance, and how even earlier theoretical calculations of the possibility of atomic splitting were not recognized for their importance. 
  Therefore, it is possible that the community did not identify the significance of the by-products of the neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Actually, the passage states that chemists could not recognize these substances as unexpected products, and that these products were present all along.
  The article suggests that physicists pursued research related to the discovery of nuclear fission without intentionally seeking it and without initially recognizing its significance.
  The passage does not suggest that uranium atoms were the easiest to split, and does mention the dangers of working with radioactive materials.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: It never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism:
  Upon rereading the article, it becomes clear that this is not a correct statement. Scientists actually produced and compiled evidence of the by-products of neutron bombardment, but failed to recognize their significance. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is not C but rather B: It did not initially realize the significance of earlier theoretical calculations indicating that atoms could be split, which paved the way for the eventual discovery of nuclear fission.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about the discovery of nuclear fission and the events leading up to it.
  Italian physicists began bombarding uraniwn with neutrons in 1934.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection between the experimental results and the concept of nuclear fission in 1939.

Question: Which one of the following is most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" (line 62)?
Choices:
  A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the discovery of nuclear fission by physicists who worked with uranium between 1934 and 1939.
  Lise Meitner, an exiled Austrian physicist, provided the crucial theoretical connection to this discovery in 1939.
  Researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved but failed to recognize it.
  Meitner pursued related research in Berlin and discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The scientists expected that the substances would be elements close to uranium.
  In 1938, research partner Otto Hahn informed Meitner that one of the substances found was barium,which would have been impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments.
  Meitner realized that the researchers had been splitting uranium atoms.
Thought: 
  The relevant evidence refers to what the physicists were actually seeing in their experiments, which was the splitting of uranium atoms during the neutron bombardment.
  Options A and B refers to the experiments conducted by the physics community and Meitner respectively, which provide part of the relevant evidence but not the complete picture.
  Option C only refers to one particular piece of evidence, the clear chemical evidence of barium production from neutron bombardment.
  Option D only refers to a significant discovery that was made in Hahn's experiments, but it doesn't include all the relevant evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Option E doesn't refer to any evidence, but rather to reasons why the products of the neutron bombardment went unidentified.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism: 
  The answer could also include Options A and B since they also provide relevant evidence, but Option C's answer is more specific and precise to the primary piece of evidence that revealed the significance of the neutron bombardment experiments.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and how scientists failed to realize what they were observing even as increasing evidence was collected. Lise Meitner was instrumental in recognizing the significance of the evidence beyond its immediate context of the minute quantities of the products produced and the dangers of working with radioactive material.
Thought: 
  The phrase "relevant evidence" refers to the crucial information that scientists collected but did not recognize as fission.
  The key information was discovered by Otto Hahn and involved barium, which could not be produced through any known mechanism and whose production was unexpected.
  Therefore, the most nearly equivalent phrase is that which best describes the key information.
  The critical information is that barium was produced through neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct, and C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses a discovery related to nuclear fission.
  The discovery was made between 1934 and 1939.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection for nuclear fission.
  Researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved before recognizing what they were witnessing.
Thought:
  The relevant evidence would refer to the evidence that supported the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The author suggests that scientists had evidence of nuclear fission before recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Option A refers to the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
  Option B refers to the results of research related to that of the Italians conducted by Lise Meitner in 1938.
  Option C refers to the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Option D refers to the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus.
  Option E refers to the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long.
  Option A, B, C, and D all describe evidence that was relevant to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  However, the author suggests that researchers had evidence of nuclear fission before recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Therefore, the most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" would be option D, which describes evidence supporting the discovery of nuclear fission.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and how it was not recognized immediately. 
  The author mentions that the relevant evidence was present for some time.
Thought: 
  The relevant evidence must be something that was present but not recognized as such at the time. 
  The experiment produced numerous and similar results, and some were not identified yet.
  The author mentions that Hahn's discovery of barium went against all previous experiences of nuclear physics, but the number of particles in the nuclei of barium and technetium added up to that of a uranium nucleus.
  The conclusion was significant and became clear to scientists after Meitner recognized the importance of the data.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence must refer to the fact that scientists had actually succeeded in splitting uranium atoms through neutron bombardment.
  This evidence had been present for some time, but it had not been recognized  because there was no right conceptual link between the evidence and the underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, the answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct.
  It is supported by the fact that scientists had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved but had failed to realize what was happening.
  They were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms apart, and they did not recognize the significance of the results until later.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence was the early experiments and results that showed nuclear fission was occurring.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, which was achieved through neutron bombardment experiments on uranium.
  Scientists did not immediately recognize what they had achieved until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical link.
  The relevant evidence had been present for some time but was lacking the correct conceptual link.
Thought: 
  The relevant evidence mentioned in the passage refers to the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  This evidence had been present for some time but scientists lacked the correct conceptual link to recognize it.
  Based on the passage, the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission was the result of the neutron bombardment experiments on uranium conducted between 1934 and 1939.
  Therefore, the answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism: 
  It is true that the neutron bombardment experiments on uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 were the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  However, the passage also mentions that the evidence was lacking the correct conceptual link.
  The correct conceptual link was provided by Lise Meitner, who discovered the significance of the data and coined the term "nuclear fission".
  So, the most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" (line 62) is not just the results of the experiments, but the results of the experiments plus the correct conceptual link to recognize their significance.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The article describes the discovery of nuclear fission, starting from the 1930s, when Fermi and others bombarded uranium with neutrons. 
  The researchers accumulated evidence that fission had occurred but did not recognize it immediately.
  Meitner discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium in Berlin. She escaped from Germany to Sweden where she continued research.
  Her research partner Otto Hahn shared his continuing experimentation with Meitner. 
  Hahn found a surprising result, one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. 
  Meitner realized that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms, identifying the phenomenon as "nuclear fission."
Thought:
  The article describes the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The relevant evidence has been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
  The most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" is the evidence that led Meitner to recognize that the researchers had been splitting uranium atoms.
  Thus, the answer must be C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism:
  You are correct that Meitner identified the phenomenon of nuclear fission after receiving information from Hahn that he had found clear chemical evidence of barium being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. 
  However, there were other experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium that led up to this discovery, and the article references those experiments as well. 
  Thus, an argument could be made that A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 is also a plausible answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The author discusses the process by which nuclear fission was discovered in the 1930s. The physicists had been performing experiments with neutron bombardment of uranium, and they observed a puzzling group of radioactive substances. In 1938, Lise Meitner discovered that one of the substances had been conclusively identified as barium, which would have been impossible to produce through any known mechanism. She realized that the researchers had been splitting uranium atoms and coined the term "nuclear fission" - the relevant evidence that had been present for some time but lacking the right conceptual link.
Thought: The author uses the term "relevant evidence" (line 62) to refer to the data that had been present for some time but had not been understood until Lise Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations. This would refer to the discovery of nuclear fission through neutron bombardment of uranium, which was finally understood once the right conceptual link was made. Therefore, the answer should be the results of experiments that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
Criticism: There are multiple pieces of evidence discussed in the passage, including the discovery of a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, the chemical evidence of barium being produced, and the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus. However, none of these on their own was enough to lead to the discovery of nuclear fission; it was only when Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations that the right conceptual link was made. Therefore, while the experiments provided the data, the "relevant evidence" refers to the discovery of nuclear fission itself.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The article describes the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The relevant evidence for the discovery was present for some time, but lacked the right conceptual link.
Thought:
  The "relevant evidence" is something that had been present for some time but not recognized as fission.
  The discovery of nuclear fission was made with the neutron-bombardment experiments on uranium.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence is the results of the neutron-bombardment experiments on uranium, which were present for some time without being accurately understood as fission.
  Thus, the answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. The article focuses on the discovery of nuclear fission and the fact that the evidence for it had existed but had not been identified as such. The experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium analyzed in lines 4-6 show that researchers had compiled evidence of nuclear fission, but the significance of the results was not recognized at the time.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the historical discovery of nuclear fission.
  The passage explains that scientists had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved before recognizing what they were witnessing.
Thought:
  The passage mentions that the relevant evidence had been present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The relevant evidence is not fully specified.
  Clues suggest that the evidence involves recognizing the occurrence of nuclear fission, and that it has a theoretical connection.
  Option A and Option B refer to specific experiments conducted by scientists or Meitner, respectively, and are not as general as the "relevant evidence" the author is talking about.
  Option C relates to Hahn's discovery of barium, which can be understood as the initial chemical evidence of nuclear fission.
  Option D is a mathematical observation that hints at the result of nuclear fission.
  Option E refers to the fact of the unidentified radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium, which is not directly related to the recognition of nuclear fission.
  Based on the passage, the relevant evidence that was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link appears to be the theoretical and experimental indications of nuclear fission.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses scientific advances in nuclear physics and the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The relevant evidence, according to the passage, had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Thought:
  The relevant evidence must be referring to "the right conceptual link" between the experiments and nuclear fission.
  From the passage, it is clear that the initial experiments with uranium bombardment provided evidence that nuclear fission can be achieved.
  However, the researchers did not recognize the significance of the evidence because they were not receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission at that time.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection when she recognized the significance of the data and coined the term "nuclear fission."
  Therefore, "the relevant evidence" must be referring to the initial experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
  A is the correct answer.
Criticism:
  There is evidence in the passage to support all of the answer choices to some extent.
  However, the passage emphasizes that the relevant evidence had been present for some time and lacked the right conceptual link, which suggests that it must be referring to the initial experiments with uranium bombardment conducted prior to Meitner's contribution.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discussed Roy Lichtenstein's contribution to pop art.
  Lichtenstein's work merged popular genre with fine art and conveyed a seriousness of theme.
  Pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism.
  Lichtenstein's work displayed a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.
  Lichtenstein's work exuded a kind of deliberate naivete and a faith in reconciliation.
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a deliberate rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, as an urge to depict contemporary life, and as having a kind of deliberate naivete and a faith in reconciliation.
  A: Lichtenstein attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  B: Lichtenstein praising a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an emotional painting would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  C: Lichtenstein praising an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  D: Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  E: Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion would indeed challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work as having a certain naivete, a faith in reconciliation, and a seriousness of theme.
  If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist's attempt to produce emotion-less, simplistic paintings, then it would suggest that Lichtenstein's own work was primarily concerned with the reflection of contemporary life - the use of simple forms drawn from popular art, after all, is a kind of 'simplicity' - and carried more of an emotional weight than such simplistic pop art. This would challenge the characterization of Lichtenstein's work as solely a product of deliberate naiveté and suggest that there might be room, within Lichtenstein's work, for a parody of stylized forms that still had some emotional depth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the work and context of the painter Roy Lichtenstein and the pop art movement.
  Lichtenstein's work merged comic book style with fine art, conveying both humor and a seriousness of theme.
  Pop art emerged as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an attempt to ignore it.
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a rebellion against previous art and an attempt to depict contemporary life using a popular genre.
  The author notes that Lichtenstein's work displays an urge toward realism and an inner sweetness, despite its surface bravado.
  To challenge this characterization, a statement would need to suggest that Lichtenstein's work was neither rebellious nor realistic/naive, or that it lacked an inner sweetness.
  A suggests that Lichtenstein was interested in abstract expressionism, but this does not directly challenge the author's characterization of his work.
  B suggests that Lichtenstein could appreciate emotional painting, but this does not refute his own style.
  C provides historical context but does not directly challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  D suggests that emotional paintings were out of style, which reinforces the idea that Lichtenstein was part of an anti-emotion trend.
  E suggests that Lichtenstein did not appreciate emotionless paintings, but this does not challenge his integration of fine art with comic book style.
  Therefore, D is the choice that most directly challenges the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.

Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Roy Lichtenstein and his role in the pop art movement.
  Lichtenstein's work merges a popular genre (comic books) with the forms and intentions of fine art.
  His work possesses both a reflective power and an impulse toward realism.
  Lichtenstein's paintings were a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in some other pop artists and abstract expressionists.
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as possessing both reflective power and an impulse towards realism.
  Lichtenstein's paintings were a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in some other pop artists and abstract expressionists.
  If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s it would suggest that he embraced the abstract expressionist movement, which would challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as a rebel against abstract expressionism.
  If Lichtenstein praised a contemporary or early abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting, the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work as possessing an impulse toward realism would be challenged.
  If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, it would not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 
  If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion, it would not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 
  Therefore, the most challenging statement would be B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage describes the work of Roy Lichtenstein, a pop art painter who incorporated comic book styles into his work. The author characterizes Lichtenstein as merging popular and commercial genres with fine art, conveying a serious and realistic depiction of contemporary life that transcends parody, and exuding a deliberate naivete with a nostalgic sweetness.
Thought: The question asks which statement would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. From the passage, it is clear that the author characterizes Lichtenstein as someone who appreciated and rebelled against abstract expressionism and was opposed to overly sophisticate and emotional paintings. Therefore, any statement that contradicts or challenges those aspects of Lichtenstein's practice and character would be a challenge to the author's characterization.
A: If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, this would suggest that he had an appreciation for their work and wouldn't necessarily challenge the author's characterization of him.
B: If Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting, this would conflict with the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as being opposed to overly emotional paintings.
C: If Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, this would also conflict with the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as being opposed to overly emotional paintings.
D: If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, this would not necessarily conflict with the author's characterization of Lichtenstein, as he is depicted as valuing a deliberate naivete and nostalgia.
E: If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion, this would not necessarily conflict with the author's characterization of Lichtenstein, as he is depicted as valuing a deliberate naivete with a nostalgic sweetness, rather than a lack of emotion altogether.
Therefore, either B or C contradicts the author's characterization of Lichtenstein the most.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Roy Lichtenstein's contribution to pop art and how his work combined popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art.
  The passage explains that pop art began as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, but artists like Lichtenstein were rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  The author also highlights how Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism and an urge to depict contemporary life.
  If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, this would suggest that he had some admiration for abstract expressionism, which would challenge the author's characterization of his work as a rebellion against it.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not state that Lichtenstein never attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters. Therefore, it is possible that he attended such exhibitions without admiring abstract expressionism as a whole. 
  However, the passage suggests that Lichtenstein's work was a rebellion and an alternative to the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism. If he frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, it could be argued that he was more influenced by their work than the passage suggests.

Thought: 
  Option A does not seem to directly challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters doesn't necessarily contradict his rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Option B also does not seem to directly challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as praising a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting doesn't contradict his own work as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Option C, on the other hand, seems to contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as he praises an early abstract expressionist, which would contradict his rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism. So, C is a challenging option.
  Option D and E don't seem to contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein, as he did not criticize any pop artist for producing either emotional or void-of-emotion paintings.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum
  C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation

  The last paragraph of the passage focuses on wampum belts, which were invented to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. 
  Therefore, the last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation.
  The answer is C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention in the last paragraph of the evolution of wampum belts from other forms of wampum, so option A is incorrect.
  While wampum belts are more complex than loose beads or string wampum, this is not the primary focus of the last paragraph, so option B is incorrect. 
  The last paragraph does not outline the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution as it was encoded using wampum; rather, it explains how wampum belts were used to encode the provisions of the constitution in pictorially derived symbols, so option D is incorrect. 
  While the last paragraph does provide evidence of wampum's effectiveness as a means of ensuring compliance with the law of the Haudenosaune Confederacy, this is not the primary focus of the paragraph, so option E is incorrect.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should not prohibit all trading based on insider knowledge, and that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible, quickly as possible.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading undermines the principles of transparency and fairness that are necessary for the market to operate effectively and protect investors.
Thought:
  The author of passage A argues that insider-trading laws should not prohibit all trading based on insider knowledge. 
  The author believes that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible, quickly as possible.
  Since the author is arguing against prohibiting all trading on insider knowledge, option A cannot be the correct answer.
  Since passage A argues for the usefulness of analyzing information about a stock, option B has part of the argument but not all of it.
  Option C aligns somewhat with passage B, but not with passage A since the author is arguing against blanket insider trading laws.
  Option D is only concerned with inside information that concerns a stock's price direction, which also does not align with the author's argument in Passage A.
  Option E legalizes trading on inside information, which does not align with the author's argument for accommodating information.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Criticism: 
  The author of Passage A argues for analyzing information about a stock but allows for any insider knowledge to be used for trades, while the option B prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Option B alone does not reflect the entire argument of passage A. 
  A better option would have been an insider trading law that requires all relevant information to be shared publicly, which aligns well with the author's support to spread information widely to optimize stock market performance.
  Therefore, the answer can be criticized but is still the most appropriate answer among the given options. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that some insider trading can be beneficial to the market and that insider nontrading is a widespread and accepted practice.
  Passage B argues that insider trading compromises the market's transparency and undermines investor confidence.
Thought:
  The author of Passage A believes that some insider trading can be beneficial to the market.
  However, the author of Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence and compromises the market's transparency.
  Therefore, the law presented in the question must allow some insider trading but not undermine investor confidence or compromise the market's transparency.
Option A prohibits any trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which does not allow for any sort of insider trading and would be in line with the position articulated in Passage B but not Passage A, so it is not the correct answer.
Option B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This option aligns with Passage A's argument that trading based on research and analysis of a stock is acceptable but insider trading based on one's position within a company is not. 
Option C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which aligns with Passage B's argument but does not contradict the points made in Passage A, so it is not the correct answer.
Option D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising. This law would allow for some insider trading but seems arbitrary and would do nothing to address the concerns raised in Passage B about investor confidence. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.
Option E legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means. This option aligns with Passage A's argument that some insider trading can be beneficial to the market, but it contradicts Passage B's argument that insider trading undermines investor confidence and compromises the market's transparency. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws could hinder the transparency of the stock market and the spread of accurate information, both of which are essential for stock prices to better reflect the relevant facts. 
  Passage B supports the idea that insider-trading is illegal and undermines the transparency of the stock market. The passage suggests that everyone should have the same access to information regarding the stock market and that insider trading unfairly compromises the market.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws could hinder transparency, which is essential for accurate stock prices, and insider nontrading should also be considered. Consequently, a law that allows trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock would conform to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not the author of passage B.
  The other four answer choices eliminate the possibility of insider trading altogether and go against the idea of insider nontrading as well. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Criticism: 
  There is not much criticism that can be made about the thought process since it's clear that the answer choice must conform most closely to the author of passage A rather than passage B. However, a potential weakness in the argument is that insider trading, based on an unfair advantage, is not corrected in the answer choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Passage A argues that the stock market functions best when all relevant information is spread widely and quickly
  - The author believes that insider trading laws can undermine the transparency and accuracy of the stock market
  - Passage A suggests that insider nontrading is a widespread and acceptable practice
  - Passage B argues that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market and prevents unfair advantages
  - The author believes that insider trading undermines investor confidence and could lead to financial repercussions
Thought:
  - The author of Passage A supports the idea that people using information not available to the general public for trading should be legal, but selling based on inside information probably not illegal
  - Choice A is too broad because it prohibits trading based on any information not shared by everyone, which would include analysis of a stock; it is not in line with the author of Passage A
  - Choice B is in line with the author of Passage A because it permits trading based on analysis but prohibits trading based on one's position within a company
  - Choice C is in line with the author of Passage B but not in line with the author of Passage A
  - Choice D does not align with the author of passage A because it differentiates between buying and selling
  - Choice E is not in line with the author of Passage A since that passage argues insider trading should be legal but this choice is a stricter interpretation of insider trading laws
Conclusion:
  Choice B best represents the position articulated by the author of passage A. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws make it a crime to make transactions based on information gained from one's position within a company, but stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely and quickly as possible. The passage emphasizes the importance of spreading knowledge that outputs a more accurate assessment of all relevant facts.
  Passage B articulates the belief that one of the basic principles of a stock market is transparency; it is unfair for some people to make investment decisions based on information that others don't have. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market.
Thought:
  Since Passage A endorses trading based on information, but emphasizes the importance of spreading knowledge, the most appropriate law in this scenario is likely to be one that permits trading based on knowledge obtained through analysis but restricts trading based on information gained from one's exclusive position in a company.
  Options A, and C aren't matching the author's position. Option E suggests legalizing trading even based on inside information, which is not a solution presented by the author.
  Option D allows selling based on knowledge that the stock should be dropping, which fits with the author's position of spreading knowledge, but it allows for the legal buying of stocks based on information that it should be rising, which goes against the idea of insider trading laws.
  Therefore, option B appears to be the most appropriate as it permits trading based on analysis but restricts transactions based on an exclusive position of a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should permit trading based on information that is available to everyone, and that such actions help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. 
  Passage B argues that allowing some people to make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have unfairly compromises the market and causes a loss of investor confidence. 
Thought: 
  The author of passage A supports the idea that trading based on information available to everyone should be allowed and may be good for the stock market. This position implies that prohibitions on insider trading should apply only to information that is not shared by everyone, and that trading based on insider information from one's position within a company should be allowed. 
  None of the specific laws mentioned in the answer choices match the position articulated by the author of Passage A. 
  A: This law would prohibit both insider trading and trading based on research since not all information is shared by everyone 
  B: This law would prohibit insider trading, which aligns with the position of the author of Passage B. 
  C: This law is not directly related to insider trading but focused on trades that could undermine investor confidence. 
  D: This answer choice is too specific and only addresses inside information that suggests price should be dropping. The author of Passage A argues that all information that reflects the accurate assessment of a stock's value is essential and should be shared equally. 
  E: This answer choice does not conform to the position articulated by the author of Passage A; it allows for trading on all inside information, whereas Passage A only supports trading on inside information which is available to anyone.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices conform to the position articulated by the author of Passage A.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit trades based on information that everyone doesn't have.
  Passage B suggests that transparent stock markets are key to investor confidence and success.
  A: Prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone. This law would prevent insider-trading, but it would not permit trades that are based on research and analysis.
  B: Permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This law would permit trades that result from research and analysis that is available to everyone, while also prohibiting insider-trading.
  C: Prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market. This law might cover insider-trading, but it would also prohibit any trade that might undermine confidence, regardless of whether the information used was publicly available.
  D: Legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising. This law would permit insider trading when the inside information leads to a decision to sell, but not when it leads to a decision to buy.
  E: Legalizes trading based on inside information as long as it is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means. This law would completely permit insider-trading, so it does not conform to the argument made by either passage.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that some insider-trading is beneficial to the market because it can help to spread accurate information, but it also acknowledges that some forms of insider-trading should be prohibited.
  Passage B stresses the importance of transparency and equal access to information in order to maintain investor confidence in the market.
  Answer B conforms most closely to the position of Passage A, as it allows for trades based on analysis that is available to everyone, while still prohibiting insider-trading. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The author of Passage A argues that insider-trading law is problematic because it restricts the free flow of information in the stock market.
  The author of Passage A suggests that "insider nontrading" (deciding not to buy or sell based on inside knowledge) is a more widespread practice that causes no ethical issues.
  The author of Passage B argues that insider trading violates the principles of transparency that underpins a functioning stock market
  The author of Passage B suggests that insider trading creates unfair advantages and undermines the confidence of investors, which could ultimately destroy the market
Thought:
  Passage A is arguing that insider-trading law should not prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
  Rather, stock prices need to reflect all relevant and accurate information about a company, including changes in circumstances.
  Additionally, the author suggests that a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising may conform more closely to their position.
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that insider trading should be illegal because it violates the principle of transparency and undermines investor confidence.
  Therefore, the law that most closely conforms to the position articulated in Passage A is D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising because it would allow people to act on inside knowledge about changing circumstances which would help stock prices to reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. 
Criticism:
  It is important to note that trading based on insider knowledge is still illegal even under such a law. 
  The law itself cannot differentiate between buying or selling based on inside information and thus, the trade based on such inside information is still considered illegal.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should be considered in the context of a functioning stock market. It suggests that individuals making trades based on information that others do not have can be beneficial to the market, while still acknowledging that insider-trading law is necessary to prevent abuse. 
  Passage B argues that insider-trading severely undermines the transparency of a market, which ultimately undermines everybody's chance of making money and the functioning of the market itself.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage A suggests that trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock is not a crime. The author argues that insider-trading law should only apply to trading that is based on non-public information obtained unlawfully. Thus, the most appropriate law for the author of Passage A would be a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Choice B is the best answer.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading can help spread accurate information within the stock market, leading to a more accurate assessment of a company's value.
  Passage B argues that insider trading unfairly gives some people an advantage over others and undermines investor confidence in the stock market.
  A: Prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone- doesn't conform to Passage A, since it does not allow for the use of inside information even if it is widely available.
  B: Permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company- supports Passage A since it allows for the use of inside information gained through analysis, but not through a special position within a company.
  C: Prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market- supports Passage B but doesn't address the argument made in Passage A about the benefits of insider trading.
  D: Legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising- partially supports Passage A, but does not allow for the use of inside information to buy stock.
  E: Legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means- directly contradicts Passage B and only partially supports Passage A. It allows the use of inside information, but does not address the argument in Passage A that insider trading can help spread accurate information.
Thought:
  The law that would conform most closely to Passage A would allow for the use of inside information gained through analysis, but not through a special position within a company. This law would allow insider trading to help spread accurate information, while minimizing the unfair advantage of those with access to inside information due to their position within a company.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.

- The new understanding of the structure of receptors will allow for more targeted treatments of brain disorders.
- The passage emphasizes the medical significance of this discovery.
- Choice D captures this main point accurately.
Criticism:
- There is not enough emphasis on the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels in choices A, B, C, or E.
- Choice E discusses receptor molecule differences, but doesn't emphasize the significance of this in the treatment of disorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the theory of how communication between neurons is possible via electrical impulses transmitted between them.
  An alternative theory proposes that chemical neurotransmitters play a role in transmitting an electrical impulse between neurons.
  The structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is that there are two theories on how communication between neurons is possible; one theory is that electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses, while the other theory is that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically by neurotransmitters. The passage goes on to discuss how receptors play a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity, and how the discovery of differences between receptor molecules could help ameliorate debilitating conditions. 
  Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not state that "the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals", but rather that there are two theories on how communication between neurons is possible. 
  Choice B is incorrect because it only mentions that enough similarities exist among chemicals to classify them as a family, and does not cover the other aspects of the passage. 
  Choice C is incorrect because it only discusses the theory of chemical transmission of electrical impulses, and does not cover receptor structure or potential medical applications. 
  Choice E is incorrect because it focuses solely on receptor differences, and does not comprehensively capture the theories/explanations discussed in the passage.
  The main point of the passage is covered in choice D, which accurately states that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, while the differences in receptors may permit selective treatment of certain brain disorders. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the debate between two theories on how communication between neurons occur in the brain. 
  One theory suggests that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons across synapses, while the other theory suggests that neurotransmitters are used. 
  The passage explains that neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the receiving neuron, causing a change in shape that allows the passage of ions, resulting in an electrical impulse. 
  The passage notes that the structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. 
  The passage highlights that several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure and that they come in several varieties, each with slightly different properties.
  The passage notes that this discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is that neurotransmitters, rather than electrical impulses, are the means by which neurons communicate in the brain.
  Evidence shows that there are similarities among these neurotransmitters, and that they come in several varieties, each with slightly different properties.
  The structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  The discovery of subtle differences among receptors raises the possibility of highly selective treatments for certain brain disorders.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Criticism: 
  Choice B is not accurate because the passage does not state that the similarities among neurotransmitters allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  Choice C is not accurate because the passage describes the debate between two theories, but the main point is not that electrical impulses are not used.
  Choice D is close, but it does not accurately convey that the selective treatment of certain brain disorders is made possible by the discovery of differences among receptors, not the transmittal of impulses.
  Choice E is not accurate because it focuses only on subtle differences among receptor molecules and does not capture the broader context of the passage about the debate between the two theories of how neurons communicate and the significance of that discovery for potential treatments of brain disorders.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Neurobiologists used to believe that the brain was guided only by electrical signals.
  An alternative theory suggested that neurotransmitters bind with receptor molecules in a receiving neuron to generate electrical impulses, but it was not initially clear how they managed to do this.
  Researchers have now discovered that neurotransmitter receptors have both a binding site and a channel for ions, and that the attachment of the neurotransmitter opens the channel, generating an electrical impulse that runs through the receiving neuron. 
  Several types of receptors can be classified as a family known as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
  Each receptor in this family has different varieties, making selective treatment of certain brain disorders a possibility.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the history of theories regarding how neurons communicate within the brain and the discovery that neurotransmitter-gated ion channels mediate electrical activity in the brain and their different varieties can be selectively targeted to treat brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is that neurotransmitter-gated ion channels mediate electrical activity in the brain, and their variety can be selectively targeted to treat certain brain disorders.
  Options A, B, and C focus only on discussing the chemical transmission of signals, but do not cover the selective treatment of brain disorders.
  Option E mentions receptor diversity as the main point, but does not discuss the role of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels in mediating electrical activity in the brain.
Thought: 
  The answer is D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention about "subtle" differences among the receptors in the question that could impact the main point of the passage.
  However, the main point of the option covers the chemical transmission of signals between neurons by neurotransmitters and the possibility of selective treatment of certain brain disorders, which is the main point of the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two theories of neuron communication: electrical and chemical.
  It explains the chemical theory, which posits that neurotransmitters are released by an excited neuron and bind to receptors on a receiving neuron. 
  The binding of the neurotransmitter causes a change in shape in the receptor, opening an ion channel and allowing ions to enter the receiving neuron. 
  The passage discusses the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, receptors that conform to the above structure and come in several varieties.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is that the workings of the brain are guided by chemical signals, specifically neurotransmitters, rather than electrical signals between neurons. 
  The passage also highlights the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, which have allowed scientists to understand better how neurotransmitters influence electrical activity in the brain. 
  Additionally, the passage mentions that the discovery of these receptors and their different varieties has the potential to lead to the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or D.
Criticism: 
  Choice A is not completely accurate because the passage discusses both electrical and chemical signals in the brain, rather than solely the latter. 
  Additionally, the receptors for neurotransmitters not only have subtle differences but also a specific structure that allows for electrical activity in the brain.
  Choice D accurately represents the main point of the passage, discussing the chemical transmission of signals between neurons and the potential for selective treatment of brain disorders based on differences in the receptors for neurotransmitters. 
  Therefore, D is the correct choice.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two theories on how communication between neurons occurs: electrical signals and chemical signals.
  The theory of chemical signals suggests that neurotransmitters secreted by excited neurons bind with their corresponding receptor molecules in the receiving neuron, making it permeable to ions and generating an electrical impulse that transmits across the neuron.
  The structure of receptors plays an important role in the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  Researchers have discovered that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them acetylcholine, GABA, glycine and serotonin receptors.
  Each of these receptors comes in several varieties, potentially leading to the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Thought:
  The passage discusses two theories on how communication between neurons occurs.
  It then describes the theory of chemical signals in detail, explaining how neurotransmitters and receptors have been discovered to work.
  Finally, it highlights the potential for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders by targeting specific receptors on categories of neurons.
  The main point of the passage is that the workings of the brain are guided by chemicals signals, that the structure of receptors plays a key role in the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity, and that the subtle differences among these receptors could lead to the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  Option A, B, and E touch on some aspects of the passage but do not capture the whole main point.
  Option C only describes one theory of how communication between neurons occurs, but it doesn't mention the crucial role that receptors play in this communication.
  Option D best reflects the main point of the passage by combining the details about the theory of chemical signals, the importance of receptor structure, and the potential for selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Criticism:
  The passage also discusses the skepticism some scientists had regarding how neurotransmitters could render the receiving neuron permeable to ions.
  This detail is not mentioned in Option D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two theories about how neurons in the brain communicate with each other; one suggests communication is electrical and the other suggests it is chemical.
  The chemical theory suggests that neurotransmitters are secreted from an excited neuron and bind to a corresponding receptor molecule in a receiving neuron to render it permeable to ions, generating an electrical impulse that is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron.
  Receptors for neurotransmitters have been found to contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions. The attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and results in the opening of its channel component.
  Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, known as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
  Brain disorders may be treated through drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that selectively impede or enhance the effects of these neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the theory of electrical impulses and the alternative theory of chemical communication between neurons in the brain, where neurotransmitters bind to receptors on receiving neurons to render them permeable to ions, generating an electrical impulse that is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron.
  The structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals to electrical signals, with neurotransmitter-gated ion channels containing both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate channel for ions.
  Brain disorders may be treated through drugs that selectively affect specific receptors on defined categories of neurons.
  The main point is that chemical communication between neurons in the brain occurs through neurotransmitters binding to receptors on receiving neurons, and drugs can be targeted to specific receptors to treat brain disorders.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders. 
Criticism:
  The answer accurately states the main point of the passage by summarizing that chemical communication between neurons occurs and that drugs can be targeted to specific receptors to treat brain disorders.
  The other answer choices do not fully and accurately capture the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the different theories about how communication between neurons happens.
  The original theory was that electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next.
  The new theory is that communication is achieved chemically by neurotransmitters.
  The passage focuses on explaining the mechanism by which neurotransmitters are transmitted between neurons.
  Neurotransmitter receptors contain both a chemical binding site and a region that functions as an ion channel.
  The discovery of different receptor varieties for different neurotransmitter-gated ion channels may lead to the targeted treatment of certain brain disorders.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how communication between neurons works, and how the original theory about electrical impulses traveling between neurons has been replaced by the theory that chemical neurotransmitters enable the transmission of message between neurons. 
  The passage focuses on explaining how the neurotransmitters enable the communication between neurons by providing evidence that neurotransmitter receptors play a pivotal role in converting the chemical signals to electrical activity.
  The passage concludes that the discovery of different types of receptors for different neurotransmitters may lead to more precise and selective treatments for certain brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is the above, which is captured by answers A and D.
Criticism: 
  Answer B is incorrect as it implies that the family of chemicals (neurotransmitters) themselves are classified as a family, rather than the receptors for these chemicals.
  Answer C is incorrect as it leaves out the pivotal role of the neurotransmitter receptors in the conversion of chemical signals to electrical activity, and the potential for targeted treatment of certain brain disorders.
  Answer E is incorrect as it overemphasizes the role of receptor differences in the brain and leaves out the mechanism of communication between neurons.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two theories of brain cell communication, one involving electrical impulses and the other involving chemical neurotransmitters.
  The idea that the neurotransmitter theory may explain brain cell communication and the gaps in knowledge that used to exist around it.
  The ways in which chemical neurotransmitters function, and the recent discovery of the structure of the receptors for these neurotransmitters (neurotransmitter-gated ion channels).
  The fact that different receptors in this family work slightly differently and that with more understanding of the differences between them, it may be possible to design selective treatments for conditions, like mood disorders or Alzheimer's disease.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses two theories of brain cell communication and their history.
  It then discusses the neurotransmitter theory and how the discovery of the structure of the receptors for these neurotransmitters explains its functionality.
  The passage ends by discussing the relevance of these discoveries and the potential for designing treatments for brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is that chemical neurotransmitters and their corresponding receptors, rather than electrical impulses, guide brain cell communication, and researchers have discovered sufficient similarities and differences among them to permit the development of more effective treatment for brain disorders.
  Therefore, the best answer choice is D.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two theories of communication between neurons: electrical signaling theory and chemical signaling theory.
  Many neurobiologists had trouble understanding the chemical signaling theory until recently.
  New research has shown that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a binding site and a channel for ions.
  These receptors are part of the neurotransmitter-gated ion channel family.
  Different types of receptors have slightly different properties.
  This difference can allow for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the two theories of communication between neurons.
  It then explains how the chemical signaling theory works and how the structure of the receptors allows it to happen.
  The new research shows that these receptors belong to a family of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
  The passage ends with how these receptors can be used to treat certain disorders.
  The main point is that the chemical signaling theory is correct and that the receptors that use it are part of the neurotransmitter-gated ion channel family, which can potentially be used to treat disorders.
  This best matches option A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Criticism: 
  There is not enough emphasis on the second part of option A that talks about selective treatment of disorders, but the majority of the option is an accurate main point.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.

  8. Abnormal protein structures are involved in the pathogenesis of some neurological conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
  9. The exact way by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction is not completely understood.
Conclusion: C is the most strongly supported statement by the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a new type of infectious pathogen called prion that lacks nucleic acid and primarily consists of protein.
  Prions can convert normally shaped prions to their abnormal, pathogenic conformation, which eventually destroys nerve cells.
  Consequently, CJD is inevitably fatal, and the body doesn't produce an immune response when prions are present.
Thought:
  The passage doesn't mention anything about the injection of prions from an infected individual to an uninfected one as the only way to transmit CJD. It only discusses the possibility of prion transformation.
  Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens is not mentioned in the passage either.
  The reproduction and ability of prions to cause CJD are well-supported by the passage.
  The passage suggests a possibility for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease to be caused by a similar process of protein malformation, but it doesn't confirm identical prions' involvement.
  Finally, the passage didn't provide any comparison between Prion diseases and those caused by other known pathogens.
  Therefore, the best-supported choice is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Criticism:
  There isn't any substantial criticism of this answer choice.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains the discovery of a new type of pathogen called a prion that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  The prion pathogen is composed mainly of protein.
  The prions differ from other known pathogens in that they reproduce themselves in an unexpected way by inducing normal prions to transform into a dangerous abnormal shape, to produce a plaque that collects in the brain and destroys nerve cells.
Thought: 
  The passage talks about the discovery of a new type of pathogen called a prion that causes CJD.
  Unlike other pathogens, prions consist mainly of protein and reproduce themselves in an unexpected way.
  Normal prions transform into a dangerous, abnormal shape one after another on contact with the abnormal prion that induces the transformation.
  This process produces a plaque that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.
  Therefore, if they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.

- The passage describes prions, which are disease agents lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly of protein, and their link to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
- Prions are capable of converting their structures into an abnormal shape, causing chain reactions that induce the transformation of other prions and lead to the formation of plaques that destroy nerve cells.
Thought:
- The passage suggests that prions reproduce themselves in an unexpected way by initiating a chain reaction, and that this is what causes CJD.
- This implies that the ability of prions to reproduce themselves is a crucial factor in the development of CJD.
- Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is C: if they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which is a disease caused by an abnormal protein pathogen called a prion.
  Prions reproduce themselves and cause the destruction of nerve cells in the brain, leading to the degenerative symptoms and neurological conditions associated with CJD.
  The passage highlights that prions represent a new type of infectious pathogen that lacks nucleic acid.
Thought: 
  Based on the information in the passage, the most strongly supported answer is C.
  The passage describes how prions can reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction, which causes normally shaped prions to transform into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation that leads to CJD.
  Therefore, if prions were unable to reproduce themselves, that development would prevent the abnormal cascade reaction that leads to CJD. 
  Choice A is unsupported, as the passage does not indicate that CJD can only be transmitted through injection.
  Choice B is also unsupported: although prions are now recognized to be capable of causing certain diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens, the passage does not assert that most infectious diseases are caused by prions.
  Choice D is incorrect, as the passage does not state that Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are caused by the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  Finally, Choice E is also incorrect, as the passage does not provide information to support the assertion that prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Criticism: 
  Based on the information in the passage, it is reasonable to conclude that prion diseases progress relatively rapidly, but the passage does not provide a basis to compare the progression rate of prion diseases to that of other types of infection.
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory, using Adam Smith's work as a reference point.
  The Pin Factory refers to the idea that there are increasing returns to scale, meaning the bigger the factory, the more specialized workers can be, and the more efficient the factory can become.
  The Invisible Hand refers to the idea that a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, with individuals being led to promote the greater good as if by an invisible hand.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is to describe the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, and how this contradiction has affected economic theory over time.
  The Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand are opposed to each other, with the former suggesting increasing returns to scale, which leads to big businesses dominating each industry and exerting monopoly power, while the latter requires many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power from being exerted.
  Until recently, economists failed to account for the increasing returns to scale, which was characterized by many enterprises such as railroads, due to the difficulty in describing it mathematically.
  Only since the late 1970s have economists found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 
Criticism: 
  Option A is incorrect because the author does not state that mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are increasing. 
  Option B is incorrect because while the passage mentions the importance of mathematical rigor in economics, it does not suggest that the functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described mathematically.
  Option C is incorrect because while recent developments in mathematics have enabled economists to describe the Pin Factory with more rigor, it does not suggest this is more so than the Invisible Hand. 
  Option D is incorrect because while Adam Smith is mentioned as the first economist to understand the Invisible Hand, it is not the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
The main point of the passage is that, until recently, increasing returns to scale, exemplified by the Pin Factory, were neglected by mainstream economic theory because they were difficult to represent mathematically, even though they are a significant factor in many industries. The passage discusses how this neglect led to a contradiction with the concept of the Invisible Hand, which requires many competitors in each industry. The passage does not focus on the assumption that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing (Choice A). It also does not state that recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously than the Invisible Hand (Choice C). Rather, the passage argues that both concepts can now be represented mathematically with rigor. The passage does describe Adam Smith's recognition of the ability of a market economy to harness individual self-interest for the common good (Choice D), but that is not the main point of the passage. Thus, the best answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the contradiction between two economic theories: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory theory (increasing returns to scale) holds that larger firms are more efficient than smaller firms due to more specialized workers.
  Increasing returns to scale leads to natural monopolies, which is opposed to the idea of the Invisible Hand.
  The Invisible Hand theory holds that in a market economy, self-interest can lead to the common good.
  Diminishing returns to scale is assumed in the Invisible Hand theory.
  Pin Factory theory was not accepted into mainstream economic thought because it was difficult to represent mathematically until the late 1970s.
Thought: 
  The article discusses two economic theories, which are the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory theory states that larger firms are more efficient due to specialized workers.
  The Invisible Hand states that self-interest in a market economy can lead to the common good.
  Diminishing returns to scale were assumed in the Invisible Hand theory.
  Pin Factory theory was not accepted into mainstream economic thought until recently due to difficulties in representing it mathematically.
  Therefore, the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand has been explained.
  The main point of the passage is to explain the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. It describes how economists struggled with the Pin Factory theory due to mathematical representation issues, and how the Invisible Hand relies on diminishing returns while the Pin Factory (increasing returns to scale) leads to natural monopolies. 
  Therefore, the best answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the inherent contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand concepts in economics.
  The Pin Factory example highlights the potential benefits of increasing the scale of production through specialization, but this can also create a monopoly tendency, which can be harmful.
  The Invisible Hand concept suggests that self-interest can lead to a better outcome at the market level.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the inherent contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand concepts in economics.
  Though they can be opposed to each other, economists have often underemphasized the importance of the Pin Factory and increasing returns in economic thought due to the difficulty of mathematically modeling it.
  Recent developments in mathematics have made it easier to represent ideas related to the Pin Factory concept.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the Pin Factory's importance has been often overlooked in mainstream economic thinking until recently when the development of mathematics made it easier to model the increasing returns to scale.
  The answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Criticism: 
  The passages cover more than the increasing returns to scale, as it highlights the contradiction in economic theory through two main concepts of Pin Factory and Invisible Hand and talks about the reasons why the Pin Factory concept was not emphasized in mainstream economic thinking.
  Moreover, the passage does not say that mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are increasing rather than decreasing.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The article discusses a contradiction in economic theory between the Pin Factory (increasing returns to scale) and the Invisible Hand (self-interest leading to the common good).

- Economics has historically favored diminishing returns because it is easier to mathematically represent.
Thought:
- The article presents the Pin Factory (increasing returns) and the Invisible Hand (self-interest leading to the common good) as opposing concepts in economic theory.
- The main point is that economics has historically favored diminishing returns because it is easier to mathematically represent, but recent mathematical developments have allowed increasing returns to gain more acceptance in economic thought.
- The article mentions Adam Smith and the Invisible Hand, but these are not the main focus.
- Answer choices A, C, and E are partially correct but do not capture the main point of the article.
- Answer choice B is correct as it summarizes the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand and explains why economics has historically favored diminishing returns.
Criticism:
- There is no mention of recent mathematical developments allowing the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously in the article, making answer choice C incorrect.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the paradox between the concepts of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory represents increasing returns to scale, where larger businesses benefit from lower costs and greater efficiency.
  The Invisible Hand represents self-interest used to benefit the greater good in a market economy.
Thought: 
  The article discusses how the two concepts of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand contradict each other. The Pin Factory illustrates the benefits of larger scale and lower costs, which can lead to monopolies. The Invisible Hand requires many competitors, which is disrupted by monopolies. The assumption that free markets are always right depends on whether returns to scale are diminishing or increasing. Initially, economists favored diminishing returns to fit mathematical models, but increasing returns are also important to many industries. Only recently have economists incorporated the concept of increasing returns by finding ways to represent it mathematically.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that while early economic thought favored diminishing returns, newer economic theory has accounted for increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
The main point of the passage is that economics has long struggled to reconcile the twin concepts of increasing returns to scale (as exemplified by the Pin Factory) and the invisible hand of the market. Most economists historically favored diminishing returns over increasing returns because the former could be more easily modeled mathematically while the latter could not. However, since the late 1970s, economists have found ways to include increasing returns into economic thought. Therefore, the answer is E: Economists have until somewhat recently failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
- Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations emphasizes the benefits of specialization and the market economy's ability to harness self-interest for the common good.
- The Pin Factory represents the idea of increasing returns to scale, which can lead to natural monopoly if left unchecked.
- Diminishing returns to scale are assumed in traditional economic theory, which supports the idea of a competitive market with many players.
- Economists have historically struggled to incorporate the Pin Factory idea into economic thought due to its difficulty to be represented mathematically.
Thought:
- The main point of the passage is the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
- Traditional economic theory assumed diminishing returns to support the Invisible Hand idea.
- Economic advancements have allowed economists to more accurately represent the Pin Factory, which has increased its recognition in economic thought.
- The passage mentions Adam Smith and his theories, but it is not the main point of the text.
- The passage does not state that economists have always assumed increasing returns to scale.
Criticism:
- The passage does not make the claim that mainstream economists assume that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
- While related to the main point of the passage, the passage does not state that the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described mathematically.
- The passage mentions that the Pin Factory has become more accurately modeled in recent years, but it does not state that it is modeled more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
- While Adam Smith is discussed, his theories are not the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a contradiction between Adam Smith's concept of the Invisible Hand and his example of the Pin Factory, which emphasized the advantages of increasing returns to scale in increasing efficiency.
  The Pin Factory example was largely ignored by economists in favor of the concept of diminishing returns, which could be described with greater mathematical rigor.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the historical struggle between Adam Smith's concept of the Invisible Hand and his example of the Pin Factory. The Pin Factory example emphasized the benefits of increasing returns to scale and led to natural monopolies. However, the Invisible Hand requires a competitive market with many players to function properly. Mainstream economists favored diminishing returns for many years since it could be described with mathematical rigor. However, recent developments in mathematics have allowed the Pin Factory to be described more rigorously and has recently been integrated into economic thought. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have recently been able to account for increasing returns to scale. 
  Thus, the answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 
Criticism: 
  The passage contrasts the concepts of the Invisible Hand and the Pin Factory and elucidates the struggle between them. However, it fails to establish that economists have recently been able to account for increasing returns to scale.
  It does not go further to establish that economists have "recently failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries". Although many economists favored diminishing returns because it could be described mathematically, it does not imply that they have completely ignored or failed to account for the increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory since Adam Smith's time. 
  The Pin Factory describes increasing returns to scale, but this can lead to monopoly and decrease competition, which is essential for the Invisible Hand to work. 
  Economics has always sought rigor and clarity through mathematical representation of ideas. 
  Until recently, economists have had difficulty representing the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor. 
Thought: 
  The main focus of the passage is on the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand as related to economics. 
  The Pin Factory is being used as an example of increasing returns to scale, which can lead to monopoly, while the Invisible Hand is emphasized as a way to harness self-interest toward the common good in a competitive market. 
  The passage also points out that economics has always sought mathematical rigor and that it has been difficult for economists to mathematically represent increasing returns to scale. 
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is most accurately expressed by E: "Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries." 
Criticism: 
  While the passage does discuss the difficulty that economists have had in representing the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor, it is not the main point of the passage. 
  The main point is the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, and how this relates to the assumption of decreasing returns to scale. 
  Therefore, the most accurate answer is indeed E.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Great Migration was a movement of the African American population in the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960 to the industrialized cities of the North due to an increased demand for labor.
  World War I and a boll weevil infestation were two of the primary factors that triggered this migration.
  Once the migration began, it continued to accelerate due to earlier migrants reducing the costs and difficulties of future migration for later migrants.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of the African American population from the Southern U.S. to the Northern cities.
  The Great Migration was triggered by various factors including increased labor demand in the North and reduced labor demand due to boll weevil infestation in the South.
  The migration continued and even accelerated for many years due to earlier migrants reducing the costs and difficulties for future migration through providing information, temporary housing, credit, and cultural cushion.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the acceleration and continuation of the Great Migration is due to the reduction of costs and difficulties provided by earlier migrants.
  The answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. None of the other options accurately express the main point of the passage. 
  Option A discusses a fact rather than the main point of the passage.
  Option B is only discussing the triggers of the Great Migration without addressing its continuation.
  Option C is only stating a detail of how the migration was able to continue and not its main point.
  Option E is true but it does not express the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the Northern United States between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by a few factors, including an increased demand for labor in the North due to World War I and reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  The migration continued and even accelerated over time, despite narrowing income differences between the North and South.
  One possible explanation for the continued migration is that earlier migrants helped reduce the costs of migration for later migrants.
Thought: 
  The passage describes the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern U.S. to the North between 1915 and 1960, and explains some of the factors that contributed to its beginning and its duration.
  The main point of the passage is that earlier migrants played a critical role in facilitating later migrations by reducing the costs of migration and providing support and information to the later migrants.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage discusses the Great Migration and its causes, as well as the role of earlier migrants in facilitating later migrations.
  However, the most accurate summary of the main point of the passage is that earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern U.S to the Northern U.S between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by several factors, such as increased labor demand in the North, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and World War I.
  The main focus of the passage is how migration developed and accelerated over time.
Thought:
  The passage describes the start of the Great Migration and the factors that triggered it, such as the increased labor demand in the North and reduced labor demand in the South.
  However, the main point of the passage is not to focus on the triggers or numbers of migration in any specific period but rather the factors that helped the migration endure over several decades and to prosper.
  The passage discusses how earlier migrants reduced the financial and physical cost of migration for later migrants and helped to provide a cultural cushion and familiarity with the new location.
  Therefore, the best answer among the choices is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial North between 1915 and 1960.
  The migration was triggered primarily by increased labor demand in the North during World War I, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and Northern recruiters targeting African American labor in the South.
  Economic theory suggests that people migrate if they expect to earn more in the destination than the origin, and the costs and difficulties of moving are outweighed by the expected earnings differential.
  Difficulties and costs include uncertainty about housing and labor markets, physical costs of travel, and adapting to a new locale and culture.
  The Great Migration was sustained and accelerated over time by earlier migrants providing information, reducing physical costs, and providing a cultural cushion for later migrants.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North.
  It was triggered by a combination of labor demand in the North, reduced labor demand in the South, and recruiters targeting African American labor in the South.
  Once migration started, momentum built over time due to earlier migrants providing information and reducing costs and difficulties for later migrants.
  Economic theory suggests that the expected earnings differential between the destination and origin must outweigh the costs and difficulties of moving.
  The Great Migration lasted for several decades despite income differences between the North and South narrowing over time.
  The main point of the passage is the role of earlier migrants in reducing costs and difficulties for later migrants, leading to sustained and accelerating migration over time.
  Therefore, D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants, is the best answer.
Criticism:
  The passage does provide information on the triggers for the Great Migration and the role of expected earnings in migration decisions, but these are not the main points of the passage.
  The role of earlier migrants is a central theme throughout the passage and is what distinguishes the Great Migration from other instances of labor migration.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about the Great Migration, which was the movement of approximately 40 percent of the African American population from the Southern United States to the industrial cities of the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by several factors, including an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I, a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and the efforts of Northern employers to recruit African American labor in the South.
  Once migration started, it developed momentum over time as current migration reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration.
  The difficulties and costs of migration include uncertainty about housing and labor-market conditions in the destination, the cost in terms of time and money of moving from the origin to the destination, and the need to adapt to a new culture or language.
  During the Great Migration, information was passed through letters and conversation, and earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants and provided them with temporary housing, food, and credit, as well as a cultural and linguistic cushion.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the Great Migration and its causes.
  It also talks about the difficulties and costs of migration, as well as the ways in which earlier migrants helped later migrants.
  The main point of the passage seems to be that the Great Migration was triggered by several factors, but once it started, it developed momentum over time due to the ways in which earlier migrants helped later migrants.
  Therefore, answer choices A and B do not fully capture the main point of the passage.
  Answer choice C is partially correct, but it only focuses on the financial costs of migration and does not fully capture the idea of earlier migrants reducing the difficulty and cost of future migration or providing a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  Answer choice E is also partially correct, but it only focuses on the duration of the Great Migration and does not fully capture the idea of earlier migrants helping later migrants.
  Answer choice D seems to best capture the main point of the passage, which is that in migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration, which started in 1915 and saw around 40% of the African American population of the Southern United States move to the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by a combination of increased labor demand in the industrial North during World War I, the use of labor agents recruiting African American labor in the South, and reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation that mined cotton crops.
  Once the Great Migration started, information was passed from earlier migrants to later migrants, which helped reduce the difficulties and cost of future migration-removing physical costs and even providing temporary housing, food, and credit to later migrants as well as cultural and linguistic cushion.

Thought: 
  The passage discusses the causes of the Great Migration and its duration.
  There were three catalysts of the Great Migration: World War I increasing labor demand in the North, labor agents recruiting African American labor in the South, and reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation. 
  Once the Great Migration started, earlier migrants passed information to later migrants, reducing the cost of future migration, both in terms of the physical moving cost and the cost of adapting. This helped to keep the migration going despite income differences narrowing.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the Great Migration was triggered by a combination of factors, including reduced labor demand in the South and increased labor demand in the North, while the duration of the migration was kept up by earlier migrants, who helped reduce the cost and difficulties of future migrations.

Criticism: 
  The other options are not accurate summaries of the main point of the passage.
  A: This option does mention the Great Migration, but it only describes the fact that around 40% of the African American population left the South between 1915 and 1960. It does not capture the broader causes and effects of the migration.
  B: This option only discusses the three catalysts of the Great Migration, which are only part of the larger picture of the causes and effects of the migration. Additionally, it does not discuss the duration of the migration or the role of earlier migrants.
  C: This option only discusses the role of earlier migrants in reducing the cost of migration, while ignoring the broader causes of the Great Migration and other factors that might have affected its duration.
  D: This option is an accurate summary of the main point of the passage.
  E: This option discusses the broader causes and effects of the Great Migration, but it does not focus on the role of earlier migrants, which is the main focus of the passage.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider trading can help spread knowledge about a company's value and that the information should be spread as widely as possible.
  Passage B argues that transparency is important in a stock market and that insider trading can undermine investor confidence and ultimately harm the market.
Thought:
  The authors of Passage A seem to believe that insider trading is not always harmful and can actually help improve the efficiency of the stock market by spreading accurate information.
  The authors of Passage B argue that insider trading can harm the market by unfairly giving some people an advantage over others and by undermining investor confidence.
  While the authors may have different views on insider trading, they would likely agree that investor confidence is important for a healthy stock market.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market. The answer is A.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues for the value of using information to make decisions in a functioning stock market.
  Insider trading occurs when individuals gain access to confidential information that is not available to the public and use it to make trading decisions, creating an advantage for themselves in the market.
  Passage B emphasizes the importance of transparency in a stock market ensuring that all participants have access to the same information.
Thought: 
  Both passages express opinions on insider trading.
  Passage A argues that the use of information to make decisions is important for a functioning market and that insider trading is not necessarily a bad thing. 
  Passage B argues that the stock market needs to be transparent so that insider trading does not occur because it creates an unfair advantage.
  The authors of both passages would most likely agree that insider trading has the potential to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
  Therefore, the answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all relevant information is quickly spread and that using accurate information to make trades is not criminal.
  Passage B argues that transparency is necessary for the stock market to work properly and that insider trading can compromise the market and investor confidence.
Thought: 
  Both passages seem to agree that accurate information is necessary for the stock market to work properly. 
  Passage B specifically argues that insider trading can compromise investor confidence, which could destroy the market.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
  The answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Criticism: 
  There is no clear agreement in either passage about whether all information should be available to all market participants at the same time, so B is not the correct answer.
  Passage A does argue that using accurate information to make trades is not criminal, so C might be a possible answer.
  However, there is no evidence that either passage advocates for insider nontrading to be regulated, so D is not a likely answer.
  Similarly, there is no evidence in either passage to suggest that insider trading is the best means for disseminating information, so E is not a likely answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A supports the idea that insider-trading law should not prevent people from acting on and disseminating information that they possess, as long as it is done in the interest of the stock market as a whole.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading undermines investor confidence, which in turn could harm the market.
Thought: 
  The authors of these passages agree about the importance of disseminating information as widely as possible to ensure that the stock market functions well.
  However, they have different views about insider-trading.
  Passage A argues that insider-trading can be beneficial for the market and should not be overly restricted.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading harms the market and should be regulated to maintain fairness.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to agree that insider-trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
  The answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Criticism: 
  There is no explicit agreement in the passages about the issue of whether all information should be available to all participants at the same time or not.
  Passage A highlights the importance of disseminating information but does not argue for complete transparency.
  Passage B argues for a transparent market, but only as part of its argument against insider-trading.
  Therefore, B cannot be the answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Insider-trading is a crime that involves using information that one has ahead of the general public because of a special position to trade stocks.
  Stock markets work best when relevant information about a company is spread widely as quickly as possible.
  Transparency is one basic principle of the stock market; successful investments are based on individual merit and skill.
Thought: 
  In Passage A, the author argues that insider-trading law should be reconsidered as it is not solely based on the premise of fairness of what information is known, but rather the law represents an outdated view of stock markets.
  In Passage B, the author argues the importance of transparency within the stock market to maintain investor confidence and ensure success is based on individual merit and skill.
  Therefore, both authors would likely agree that insider trading has the potential to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
  The answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Insider-trading is a crime that is based on making or influencing stock transactions based on information that the general public doesn't have access to.
  The field of stock brokering is based on people gaining information that others don't have and then using it to profit for themselves or their clients.
  Stock markets work best when all relevant information about a company is spread as widely and quickly as possible which helps reflect the most accurate assessment of all relevant facts.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that the stock market works best when all the relevant information is widely distributed because it leads to more accurate stock assessments. 
  Insider trading tends to give people that possess inside information an unfair advantage over the broader market participants who don't have that information which, therefore, undermines investor confidence in the stock market. 
  Passage B advocates for transparency in the stock market, meaning that all information that has an impact on trading decisions ought to be available to all participants at the same time. 
  The passage argues that transparency is important for equal and fair trading among all investors, which ultimately leads to investor confidence and the fund needed to grow successful companies. 
  Passage doesn't suggest that insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading, nor does it suggest that insider trading is the best way to disseminate information possessed by insiders.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to agree with choice A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Criticism: None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  A: The authors of both passages seem to agree that insider-trading can affect investor confidence, but they have differing views on whether or not it should be considered a crime.
  B: Passage B argues that a transparent stock market is necessary for fairness and success.
  C: Both passages seem to agree that stock analysis is a necessary part of investing and that investors should be able to use their skills and knowledge to make informed decisions.
  D: Neither passage specifically mentions insider nontrading regulations.
  E: Passage A argues that the best way to disseminate insider information is through non-insider traders acting on accurate information.
Thought: 
  Both passages seem to agree that investor confidence is important for the stock market. However, they disagree on what measures are primarily responsible for upholding investor confidence. While passage B advocates for transparency, passage A seems to suggest that spreading accurate information through non-insider trading is the best practice. Additionally, neither passage appears to be advocating for insider non-trading regulations or insider trading as a means of disseminating information.
Conclusion: 
  Based on the information and reasoning provided, the authors would most likely agree that it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Passage A argues that insider-trading law may hinder the efficient functioning of stock markets and argues that insider nontrading is also a common practice.
  - Passage B argues that insider trading is unfair and undermines investor confidence and may have wider economic impacts. 
Thought:
  Both passages agree that the stock market depends on accurate information and evaluations of a company's value. However, they differ in their opinion on insider trading. Passage A argues that the efficient functioning of the stock market requires the use of all available information to make quick trading decisions and, as such, insider trading should not be criminalized. In contrast, Passage B states that insider trading is unfair because it gives some investors an unfair advantage, which undermines the fairness and transparency of the market. 
Criticism: 
  It is not entirely clear whether either of the two passages would fully agree with any of the answer choices. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading law can compromise the accuracy of stock prices and that insider nontrading is similarly affecting stock prices.
  Passage B argues that transparency in the stock market is important because it ensures that investors have confidence in the market.
Thought: 
  Both passages agree that investor confidence in the stock market is important. However, they differ on whether insider trading is acceptable or not. Passage A questions whether insider trading law compromises the accuracy of stock prices, and argues that insider nontrading is similarly not a problem. 
  Passage B asserts that transparency is necessary in the stock market because it ensures that investors have confidence in the market, and advocates that insider trading should be illegal. 
  Therefore, the authors would most likely agree that A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should be considered carefully as insider trading is a widespread practice, and it helps ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. In contrast, Passage B advocates for transparency in the stock market and asserts that people invest in the market because they believe they can make money, thus underscoring the importance of investor confidence for the growth and success of companies.
Thought:
  The authors would be most likely to agree that insider trading should be regulated to some extent since both passages acknowledge the importance of accurate information in the market. While passage A recognizes the importance of insider trading, it also emphasizes good faith in investors concerning the regulation, whereas Passage B argues that it undermines transparency and cripples investor confidence. Both authors agree that the stock market should function based on merit and skill, but only Passage B stresses that the information should be accessible equally to all participants. Therefore, based on the texts, the authors would most likely agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market (Option A).

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: indicate why previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided
  B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events
  C: challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915
  D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain
  E: suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration began in 1915 due to several factors, including labor demand in the industrial North, recruitment efforts by Northern employers, and a boll weevil infestation that reduced labor demand in the South.
  The Great Migration continued and even accelerated in subsequent decades, despite narrowing income differences between North and South.
  Once started, migration developed momentum over time as prior migrants reduced the difficulties and cost for future migrants through information sharing, reduced physical costs, and providing temporary housing, food, and credit.
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states, "Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants' cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then-new surroundings."
  The sentence emphasizes the role of prior migrants in reducing the difficulties and costs of future migration by sharing information, providing support, and creating a cultural cushion for later migrants.
  This sentence does not indicate that previous research was misguided, extend the explanation to later events, challenge traditional views about wage differences, or suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of the sentence is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915 and 1960.
- The passage identifies three catalysts for the Great Migration: increased demand for labor in the industrial North during World War I, Northern employers recruiting African American labor in the South due to cut off immigration during the war, and reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
- The passage explains that once the Great Migration started, it developed momentum over time and that early migrants played an important role in helping later migrants with information, physical costs, adaptation, and cultural support.
Thought:
- The last sentence of the second paragraph says, "Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings."
- This sentence is preceded by information about how early migrants helped later migrants with information, physical costs, and adaptation.
- The sentence suggests that early migrants played a role in reducing the difficulty of adapting to new surroundings for later migrants, by providing cultural support.
- The purpose of this sentence is to present a fact about the Great Migration - how early migrants supported later migrants culturally - that the authors seek to explain.
- Therefore, the answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism:
- None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the factors that led to the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North of the United States between 1915 and 1960. 
  The second paragraph discusses why the Great Migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, despite the narrowing of the North-South income differences. 
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph refers to how previous migrants facilitated the migration of new migrants. 
  This sentence presents a fact about the Great Migration, that previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants. 
  The purpose of this statement is to explain one of the reasons why the Great Migration continued and even accelerated over time; previous migrants reduced the difficulties and costs of future migration for new migrants. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the authors seek to challenge previous research on the Great Migration or that they seek to extend their explanation of its causes to later events. 
  Similarly, there is no evidence to suggest that the authors are presenting this fact to suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the Great Migration, when many African Americans in the Southern United States moved to the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The causes of the Great Migration are discussed in paragraphs one and two.
  The third paragraph focuses on the difficulties and costs of migration, and how previous migrants helped reduce these for later migrants.
Thought:
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states, "Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing." 
  This sentence suggests that the authors believe there is still something left to explain about the Great Migration, even though the three causes of the migration were discussed earlier.
  Since the sentence refers to later decades, it seems likely that the authors will offer an explanation that extends beyond the initial catalysts for the migration.
  This reasoning suggests that the primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
  Choice D accurately captures this interpretation.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial cities of the North between 1915 and 1960.
  It outlines three main catalysts of the Great Migration: increased labor demand in the industrial North due to World War I, limited immigration during the war, and a boll weevil infestation in the South.
  The passage also suggests that once the Great Migration began, it developed momentum as current migration reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration.
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph refers to the fact that previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then-new surroundings.
  This sentence supports the notion that the Great Migration developed momentum over time as current migration reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration.
  The purpose of this sentence is to explain why migration continued and accelerated in subsequent decades, even as North-South income differences were narrowing.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process and answer are correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial cities of the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The authors propose that momentum developed over time as early migrants reduced the cost and difficulty of future migration by passing on information and providing support to later migrants.
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states that previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so they did not have to struggle as hard with their new surroundings.
  This sentence provides an explanation of how the Great Migration continued and even accelerated in subsequent decades.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to explain a fact about the Great Migration, namely how it continued and accelerated over time.
  The answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the Northern United States between 1915 and 1960.
  The third paragraph explains how migration developed momentum over time.
Thought:
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states that the authors propose to explain why migration continued and accelerated, even when income differences between the North and the South were narrowing.
  It seems like this sentence provides a transition from the causes of the Great Migration to the ongoing effects of the migration.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of the sentence is to extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration, a period when many African Americans left the South to move to the industrial North between 1915 and 1960.
  The second paragraph discusses why migration continued and accelerated over time, even as North-South income differences narrowed.
Thought:
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states that previous migrants provided a cultural cushion and other forms of support to later migrants.
  This implies that the continued and accelerating migration was due in part to the ease that earlier migrants provided to later migrants.
  Therefore, the sentence serves to explain why migration continued and accelerated over time.
  The answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism:
  There is no indication in the passage that the authors believe previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided, so A is incorrect.
  While the sentence does extend the authors' explanation of the Great Migration by mentioning how earlier migrants helped later migrants, B is too broad a statement and not specific to the purpose of the sentence.
  The sentence mentions North-South income differences, but it does not challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher, so C is incorrect.
  The sentence is not suggesting that the Great Migration cannot be explained, so E is also incorrect.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial cities of the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The first catalysts of the Great Migration were World War I, immigration changes, and the boll weevil infestation.
  Economists have traditionally explained migration in terms of expected earnings in the destination and the difficulties and costs of migrating, which can include housing and labor-market conditions, physical moving costs, and adapting to a new culture or language.
  During the Great Migration, early migrants provided information to future migrants through letters and conversation, reduced physical moving costs by traveling with later migrants, and provided temporary housing, food, and credit.
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph seems to provide further explanation about a specific aspect of the Great Migration. 
  It mentions previous migrants' roles in reducing the cost of adapting to a new locale and culture for later migrants.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain. 
  Specifically, the authors are explaining how the momentum of migration developed over time. 
  Thus, the answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The first paragraph explains three catalysts of the Great Migration: increased labor demand in the North during World War I, Northern recruitment of African American labor in the South, and reduced demand for labor in the South due to boll weevil infestations.
  The second paragraph discusses why, despite narrowing North-South income differences, migration continued and accelerated in subsequent decades.
Thought:
  The question asks specifically about the last sentence of the second paragraph.
  The sentence explains that earlier migrants provided a cultural cushion for those who came later, reducing their need to acclimate to new surroundings and make adjustments.
  The sentence does not challenge previous research on the Great Migration or extend the authors' explanation to later events.
  The sentence presents a fact about the Great Migration that the authors want to explain in the rest of the paragraph.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately characterizes the relationship between the two passages?
Choices:
  A: Passage A offers a critique of a power possessed by juries, while passage B argues in support of that power.
  B: Passage A denounces a judicial custom,while passage B proposes improvements to that custom.
  C: Passage A surveys a range of evidence about jury behavior, while passage B suggests a hypothesis to explain that behavior.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the concept of jury nullification and its potential problems. It argues that the power of jury nullification can be problematic because juries are not required to explain their verdict, might not have sufficient evidence to make a reasoned decision, and are not elected or accountable.
  
  Passage B discusses the potential benefits of jury nullification. It argues that when juries nullify a law because it is too trivial or the circumstances are extenuating, they act as a safety valve to police and prosecutors. Additionally, when juries nullify because they believe a law is unjust, they perform a useful function in indicating potential problems with the law. However, the passage notes that juries should not nullify based on factors they should ignore and that this is likely to be rare.
  
Thought: 
  Passage A critiques the power of jury nullification and potential problems associated with it, while Passage B argues in support of such power and its potential benefits.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances such as proteins and carbohydrates are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are diverse chemicals that have no known internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Some secondary substances are biochemical defenses against plant enemies.
  Some plants taste or smell bad to insects in order to warn them of the presence of some harmful substances.
Thought:
  Plants have two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are diverse chemicals that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  It's like how a car needs mechanical components such as engines and transmissions for it to run, while features such as paint and taillights are less essential but give it a distinctive look and serve other functions.
  Answer (B) describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. 
  Primary substances are essential for growth and proper functioning. 
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. 
  Some secondary substances attract pollinating insects to blossoms. 
  Other secondary substances are defensive against insects. 
  Insects have evolved ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. 
Thought: 
  Primary substances are essential for growth.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Therefore, primary and secondary substances have different functions in plants.
  Similarly, features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  Therefore, the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances is most closely analogous to the relationships between mechanical components such as engines and transmissions, which are necessary for automobiles to run, and features such as paint and taillights, which give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  The answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism: 
  The relationship between electricity and generators used in hospitals does not match the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances because in plants both primary and secondary substances are naturally occurring whereas electricity and generators are man-made. 
  The relationship between mechanical components in clothing factories and electrical components used to power them also does not match because they are both man-made components whereas primary and secondary substances are naturally occurring. 
  The relationship between braking systems and wheels in trains is a mechanical relationship whereas primary and secondary substances in plants are chemical relationships. 
  The relationship between word-processing programs and computers is not a relevant analogy here because it is unrelated to the functions of primary and secodnary substances in plants. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Plants have primary and secondary chemical substances.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances have arisen by mutations and been conserved by natural selection because some repel predators or attract pollinating insects to blossoms.
  Insects have evolved ways to circumvent plant defenses against them and prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent.
Thought:
  The relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants could be analogous to the relationship between essential and nonessential components of a system or entity.
  A: Generators, like primary substances, are essential to the proper functioning of a hospital or system, but are not unique or distinctive. Electrical devices such as lights and medical instruments, like secondary substances, are nonessential, but they provide functionality and individuality to the hospital or system.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions, like primary substances, are necessary to the proper functioning of the car or system. Features such as paint and taillights, like secondary substances, provide distinctive qualities and are nonessential to the car's functionality.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories, similar to primary substances. Electrical components such as wires and transformers, like secondary substances, are nonessential to the mechanical functioning of the factory, but provide support. 
  D: Braking systems are necessary for trains to decelerate and stop, similar to primary substances. The friction and pneumatic components are both essential to stopping the train and may be analogous to different types of secondary substances in plants that both repel and attract predators.
  E: Specialized word processing programs, like secondary substances, are unique to the computer and not essential for basic functioning, like primary substances. These programs provide distinctive qualities and functionality to the computer.
  Choice D appears to have the strongest analogy to the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants, as both comprise two essential components that work together to accomplish a larger, more complex task. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances such as proteins, carbohydrates, and vitamins are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. 
  Secondary substances are responsible for the taste and smell of plants.
  Natural selection is involved in determining which secondary substances are passed down.
Thought: 
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for proper function and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are responsible for taste and smell in plants.
  Natural selection determines which characteristics of plants are passed down.
  So, the set of relationships that is analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances is a system where some components are required for proper functioning and are always present, while other components are not necessary for proper functioning, but are responsible for aesthetic or additional functionalities. The components that are not required for proper functioning undergo a selection process.
  The relationship between mechanical components in cars and electrical power or the relationship between word processing programs and the computer's operating system are not analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances. 
  The relationship of braking systems in trains being composed of friction and pneumatic components is not analogous to this relationship, as both types of components are necessary for the functioning of the brake system.
  The relationship between the use of generators for hospitals in case of power failure is somewhat analogous to the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants in that generators are not necessary for proper functioning but are used in specific cases to ensure that the hospital continues to function. However, this relationship is not as direct as the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known internal role in plant processes, but they give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
Thought:
  The question asks for a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Plants require primary substances for growth and proper functioning, and they also contain secondary substances that give them their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Therefore, we need to find a pair of things in which one is required for proper functioning, and the other is not required for proper functioning but gives it a distinctive characteristic (i.e. taste or smell). 
  Option B is the most similar because engines and transmissions are required for a car to run properly, while paint and taillights give it distinctive characteristics that are not necessary for proper functionality.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. 
  Secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. 
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. 
  Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. 
  Other secondary substances are defensive substances against the enemies of plants, some causing insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die, while others warning the insect of the presence of some other harmful substance. 
Thought: 
  Plants contain primary and secondary substances. 
  Primary substances are necessary for growth and proper functioning of the plants. 
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. 
  Some secondary substances attract pollinating insects for fertilization, while others are defensive substances against the enemies of plants. 
  The relationships between the primary and secondary substances in plants are most closely analogous to the relationship between the necessary mechanical components for a car to run and the features that give a car a distinctive look and serve additional functions. 
  Cars need the necessary mechanical components to run, but they can run without the additional features.
  Similarly, plants need primary substances to grow and proper function, but the secondary substances give plants a distinctive taste and smell. 
  Therefore B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them. is the best answer.
Criticism: 
  There is another characteristic of secondary substances that the question does not discuss - some secondary substances also include biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants. This aspect of secondary substances is not present in any of the answer choices. However, option B provides a suitable analogy for the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants and is still the most appropriate answer. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes two categories of chemical substances found in plants: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are necessary for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are diverse and have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive taste and smell.
  Insects play a role in the development of secondary substances as a result of genetic mutations in individual plants.
  Natural selection determines whether mutations survive and get passed on to subsequent generations.
  Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they attract pollinators while other substances arose as defense mechanisms against plant-eating insects.
Thought:
  The relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants is such that primary substances are essential, while secondary substances are not essential but contribute to plants' distinctive properties.
  Of the given choices, (B) seems to most closely match this same pattern, with mechanical components serving an essential function in automobiles, whereas features such as paint and taillights, while important in their own right, do not play a role in the car's essential functionality.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Criticism:
  The analogy between plants' primary and secondary substances and automobile functionality is not perfect.
  There may be other choices that could be argued to fit the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants more closely.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances result from genetic mutations, and the favorable mutations survive and are conserved due to natural selection.
Thought:
  Plants have two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances result from genetic mutations that survive due to natural selection.
  Therefore, the closest analogous set of relationships is an object that has necessary components for starting called primary components, and other features that serve functions and provide distinctive look or smell called secondary components.
  The answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary substances.
  The primary substances are needed for the growth and proper functioning of plants.
  The secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The secondary substances are diverse and multitudinous.
Thought: 
  Primary substances are necessary for the growth and functioning of plants.
  Secondary substances give the plant its taste and smell.
  Paint and taillights give a car its appearance; they are extras that are not necessary for the car to run.
  Therefore, B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them, is most closely analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between the plants and their primary and secondary substances is about the necessity of primary substances and the non-essential quality of secondary substances as they are not vital for plant survival.
  In option B, the mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for the operation of automobiles, but paint and taillights are not necessary for the functioning of the car, but they serve other purposes.
  This analogy does not reflect the relationship between the primary and secondary substances in plants accurately.
  Thus, this choice is not a suitable answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are two categories of chemical substances in plants: primary and secondary. 
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning in all plants. 
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. 
  Secondary substances can attract pollinating insects to blossoms, are biochemical defenses against plant enemies, or are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade insects from feeding by warning of harmful substances. 
  Plants and plant-eating insects have a competitive relationship where plants develop defenses and insects evolve ways to circumvent them. 
Thought:
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is described as the substances that are required for proper plant growth and those that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. 
  One is necessary for proper functioning, while the other plays a role in natural selection. 
  Similarly, one of the answer options must contain a necessary component and an additional component that is not required for the proper functioning, but has some other role. 
  Option B is the most fitting as mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run, but features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, which are not essential for the car to run. 
  Primary substances play an essential role in proper plant growth, whereas secondary substances are not essential but serve other purposes.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how art historically was produced by and for political and social elites in two ways: commissioning a well-known artist to produce something and creating a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin analyze the latter kind of art to show how it embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.
Thought:
  Taruskin and others analyze art that expressed the ideals and way of life of political and social elites.
  The analysis requires that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  The most talented artists typically had to find a place in the margins of the establishment because the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
  A great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings, but because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, the passage suggests that Taruskin's position may commit him to the view that if it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the two ways art historically was produced by and for political and social elites, explains that the sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with the art produced the second way, and acknowledges that sometimes the more talented artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment. 
Option A: The passage does not suggest anything about the most talented artists throughout history and their work embodying the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
Option B: The passage does not provide any information about the most successful artists working today and their reflection of the ideology of the elite.
Option C: The passage suggests that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way only in the view of the sociohistorical critics, like Taruskin, and if it is to work, it must eliminate the possibility that the artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.
Option D: The passage notes that historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class and that more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment; however, it does not suggest that typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
Option E: The passage mentions that some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings; thus, subverted the ideology of the elite. However, it does not suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin analyze art produced by and for political and social elites that express and mirror the elite's ideals and way of life, which may not necessarily be the work that endures. The passage also recognizes that talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment, and some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Therefore, it cannot be A, B, or D because they do not match the passage's argument. In contrast, Option C is appealing but does not generalize the argument sufficiently. It limits the argument to high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite and is incorrect, as per the passage. Option E appears to be a broader, more compelling statement and more closely aligned with the passage. The passage suggests that artists whose work subverted the ideology of the elite could be successful, although certainly not exclusively so.
Criticism: 
  The passage is not as clear about subversive art being more successful or talented than art that reflects or embodies ideology of the elite. The text is more concerned with analyzing how sociohistorical critics like Taruskin deal with art produced by and for political and social elites, and the different ways that art was commissioned and produced historically. Option E overstates the passage's argument slightly.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the ways in which art has been produced by and for political and social elites throughout history.
  The passage describes two ways in which art was produced by the elite: 1) commissioning an artist to produce a work for display and 2) creating a work that expressed the ideals of the patron.
  The passage suggests that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to analyze the second type of art, which embodies the ideology of the elite.
  The passage notes that the taste of the aristocracy and middle class varies and does not always produce enduring art.
  The passage argues that some enduring art that went against the ideals of the elite was produced reluctantly, and that such works may still embody the ideals of the elite in hidden ways.
Thought:
  Taruskin's position is that high art is produced by and for political and social elites.
  According to the passage, this means that Taruskin's view emphasizes the second way in which art has historically been produced by the elite - creating a work that expressed the ideals of the patron.
  The passage suggests that such works may embody the ideals of the elite in hidden ways, even if the artist subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.
  However, the passage does not support the idea that Taruskin believes enduring art always embodies the ideals of the elite, nor does it suggest that he believes the most talented artists throughout history reflect either the ideology of the elite or subvert it.
  Therefore, options A and E are not the correct answer.
  The passage suggests that the taste of the aristocracy and middle class is not always apt to produce enduring art, suggesting that option B is not correct.
  The passage does suggest that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite may still embody that ideology in hidden ways, suggesting that option C might be the correct answer.
  However, the passage does not address whether the artists who produce art reflecting the ideology of the elite are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes, so option D cannot be confirmed or denied by the passage.
Criticism:
  Given the information provided in the passage, it is not entirely clear whether Taruskin's position is that high art always embodies the ideology of the elite, or whether he recognizes that artists may subvert or challenge the ideals of the patron even while producing art that reflects those ideals.
  The passage does suggest that Taruskin focuses on analyzing art that embodies the ideology of the elite, but it does not provide a clear statement of his position on whether such art always reflects or subverts the elite's ideals.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the ways in which art historically was produced for and by the political and social elites.
- The author highlights a distinction between commissioned art that reflects the elites' ideals and commissioned art that merely displays their wealth and taste.
- The author suggests that some sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze the former type of art, but such analysis requires the elites to have a recognizable identity and consensus.
- The author notes that historically, the aristocracy and the middle class were the classes able to commission art, and that artists sometimes had to find patrons with eccentric tastes or create art that went against the grain of elite values.
Thought:
- The passage does not suggest that Taruskin believes that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways, so option A can be eliminated.
- The passage does not make any reference to the success of artists working today, so option B can be eliminated.
- The passage suggests that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite can actually support that ideology in some way, as this is the kind of analysis preferred by sociohistorical critics like Taruskin.
- The passage does not suggest that art that reflects the ideology of the elite is typically produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes, so option D can be eliminated. 
- The passage notes that some art that went against the grain of elite values endured, and that sociohistorical critics must engage in an analysis to claim that such art embodied the ideals of the elite in hidden ways. This suggests that art that subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways may be valued by Taruskin and other sociohistorical critics.
Criticism:
- None
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes two ways that art has been produced by and for political and social elites throughout history. 
  The first way was when a member of the elite engaged a well-known artist to produce something for display.
  The second way was when a work was created or had created, a work that expressed and mirrored their ideals and way of life. 
  The passage suggests that sociohistorical interpreters analyze art produced the second way, because it allows them to explore how such art embodied the ideology of the elite, regardless of the identity of the artist. 
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that sociohistorical interpretations of art focus on art produced by and for the elite that reflects their ideology and way of life, and that this includes works that seem to go against the grain of elite values. 
  However, because it is not always clear whether the ideals expressed in the work align with those of the elite who commissioned it, a subtle analysis is required to uncover the ways in which such art embodies elite ideology. 
  Therefore, the passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that if high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way, then it is because the elite's ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved. 
  The answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way. 
  While the passage does suggest that sociohistorical interpreters analyze art produced by and for the elite to understand how it embodies their ideology, it does not suggest that this always means oppressive or subversive art actually supports the ideology it purports to undermine. 
  Therefore, it is not clear that any of the answer choices are correct.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the sociohistorical interpretation of art.
  The passage distinguishes between two ways that art historically was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The passage suggests that Taruskin and others prefer to analyze art produced the second way, as it enables them to analyze the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
Thought:
  Taruskin and others analyze art produced by the political and social elite to determine how it embodies their ideology.
  The passage suggests that artists sometimes produce work that goes against the grain of elite values, but is still paid for reluctantly, and may endure.
  If art that goes against the grain endures, Taruskin and others must analyze it to find how it embodies the ideology of the elite.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position suggests that if high art appears to undermine the ideology of the elite but endures, it actually supports that ideology in some way.
  The answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Criticism:
  It is possible to interpret the passage and Taruskin's position in different ways.
  For example, Taruskin may not believe that enduring art undermines the ideology of the elite, but rather he may view it as a reflection of both the artist and the elite's values.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Taruskin's interpretation of art produced by and for political and social elites in history.
  The first way art was produced by and for elites was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the second way art was produced by and for elites is important to Taruskin's position. This means he is interested in analyzing art that reflects and embodies the ideals of the elite, rather than just art produced by the elite for display.
  The passage also suggests that Taruskin believes these subtle analyses can reveal the ideology of the elite, even if they are unaware of how it is revealed in the art.
  Therefore, choice C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way, is the view that the passage suggests Taruskin commits to.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how art historically has been produced by and for political and social elites. 
  The passage distinguishes between two different ways that art was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  Taruskin and other sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with art produced the second way because it embodied the ideology of the elite.
Thought:
  Taruskin and other sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze art produced by political and social elites that embodied their ideology. 
  The passage suggests that some very talented artists throughout history had to find a place in the margins of the establishment because the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class often did not produce art that endures. 
  The passage further suggests that some established art reflects the ideals of the elite, even if on the surface the art appears to undermine them.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position probably commits him to the view that even if art appears to undermine the ideology of the elite, it might actually support that ideology in some way (Choice C).
Criticism:
  The passage does not support the idea that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied or subverted the ideology of the elite. 
  The passage does not state that successful artists working today reflect or subvert the ideology of the elite. 
  The passage does not suggest that art produced by the elite was made exclusively by members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two ways art was "produced by and for political and social elites": (1) commissioning a famous artist to produce something for display and (2) creating a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, such as Raphael's frescoes commissioned by Pope Julius II.
  The sociohistorical interpretation of art views it as a body of work imposed by a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals.
  The passage suggests that artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Taruskin and others prefer to deal with art produced the second way, which: (1) expressed and mirrored a patron's ideals and way of life; and (2) embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. Moreover, according to Taruskin's position, if art endures despite its seemingly contrary message to the dominant elite's values, the art must embody the ideal of the elite, who were unaware that their values are revealed by work that they disapproved of. Therefore, the passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to view C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not suggest that Taruskin's position is about the most talented artists or the most successful artists throughout history.
  The passage does not suggest that artists who produce art reflecting the ideology of the elite are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  The passage suggests that artists sometimes subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Therefore, the passage does not suggest that the most talented artists produced work that subverted the ideology of the elite.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the ways in which art historically was "produced by and for political and social elites." 
  Taruskin believes that high art is produced by and for political and social elites. 
  Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced that embodied the ideology of the elite.
  
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way. 
  Taruskin believes that high art is produced by and for political and social elites, and that sociohistorical critics should analyze the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  Therefore, if high art appears to undermine the ideology of the elite, Taruskin would likely argue that it does so in a way that ultimately supports that ideology.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
Choices:
  A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  D: Most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  E: Dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of the dance-isolation technique and her success in bringing traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into modern North American dance. 
  Dunham's success was due to her training in both anthropological research and choreography. 
  Dance had been neglected as an area of social research before Dunham's work in the field of dance ethnology. 
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from the prevailing methodology that data gathering can only be conducted from a position of complete detachment. 

Thought: 
  The peers mentioned in line 22 are likely other social scientists who share the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. 
  Choice A suggests most social scientists who have studied dance misinterpreted it, but the passage does not provide evidence to support this claim. 
  Choice B contradicts what the passage suggests about Dunham's success and the neglect of dance as an area of social research. 
  Choice C suggests research into dance as a cultural form lacks scientific precision, but the passage suggests Dunham's approach to research diverged from this methodology. 
  Choice D suggests most experts in the field of dance cannot conduct studies in dance ethnology, but the passage does not support this claim. 
  Choice E suggests dance forms are too variable to allow for rigorous data collection, which goes against what Dunham's work suggests. 

Criticism: 
  None. The answer appears to be directly supported by the passage.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of dance-isolation technique into North American and European choreography. 
  Dunham was a pioneer in the field of dance ethnology, which was neglected previously by social scientists. 
  Dunham's research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture, were critical to her success. 
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time. 
Thought: 
  The peers mentioned in line 22 will be most likely to agree with one of the following statements about the study of dance.
  The passage describes how dance ethnology was neglected before Katherine Dunham and how her approach diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time, which suggests that dance was not considered a legitimate area of social research before Dunham.
  The passage states that experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research, and colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing. 
  Therefore, peers in line 22 may have believed that social scientists need not be well-versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them, suggesting that option B is a likely answer.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's success in bringing traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into North American dance through her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  The passage notes that dance had previously been neglected as an area of social research due to the lack of anthropologists trained in dance and experts in dance trained in social research methods.
  The passage explains that Dunham's success was due, in part, to her approach to research, which diverged from prevailing methods of complete detachment, allowing her to participate in and immerse herself in the dances she was observing.
Thought:
  The "peers" referred to in line 22 considered detachment necessary for effective data gathering.
  Peers may have believed detachment was necessary because they lacked expertise in dance and its techniques.
  Katherine Dunham's success in cultural research and her approach to research involved participation and immersion in dance traditions.
  Therefore, peers may have considered Dunham's research methodology insufficient or unreliable.
  The most likely statement that peers would have agreed with is that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions to obtain reliable data about them.
  So, the answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism:
  There is no mention in the passage of peers agreeing or disagreeing with any statement about the study of dance.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's contributions to the field of dance ethnology and her success in bringing traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into modern North American dance. 
  In the 1930s, dance was neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists were not trained in dance, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. 
  Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. 
Thought:
  The question asks what "peers" would agree with about the study of dance. 
  The passage suggests that the peers viewed detachment as important for effective data gathering. 
  Choice B opposes that view, but there is no evidence to support it. Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time, and her success was due in no small part to her approach. 
  Choices A, C, D, and E are not supported in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism: N/A
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's success in introducing traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into modern North American dance through her work in both anthropology and choreography.
  The passage also discusses how dance had been neglected as an area of social research and how Dunham's approach diverged radically from the prevailing methodology in the 1930s.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Dunham's success as an anthropologist and choreographer in bringing dance techniques from other cultures into North American dance was due in part to her rejection of prevailing methodologies and willingness to immerse herself in the dances she was studying.
  The passage mentions that most social scientists at the time gravitated toward areas that were recognized as scientifically rigorous and that dance had been neglected as an area of social research.
  The passage suggests that social scientists may have advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing because they believed in the importance of complete detachment in data gathering.
  Therefore, the "peers" mentioned in line 22 were likely social scientists who subscribed to the prevailing methodology and viewed detachment as an important aspect of data gathering.
  Based on this, the "peers" would most likely have agreed with statement (B) that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide any direct evidence to suggest that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would agree with statement (B).
  The passage does suggest, however, that the prevailing methodology at the time emphasized complete detachment in data gathering, which could be seen as supporting statement (B).
  Furthermore, the passage suggests that most social scientists at the time did not have a strong background in dance, which could be seen as contradicting statement (B) to some extent.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Katherine Dunham, an African American choreographer, introduced a technique known as dance-isolation.
  This technique has long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures.
  Dunham's training in both anthropological research and choreography was critical to her success in bringing traditional dance techniques into the mainstream of modern North American dance.
Thought:
  Anthropologists of the time were reluctant to study dance because it was neglected as an area of social research.
  Most social scientists at the time were gravitating toward areas that were recognized by their peers as scientifically rigorous and legitimate modes of inquiry.
  No other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research.
  Therefore, Dunham diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time through her approach to research in dance ethnology.
  It can be inferred that Dunham's success in bringing traditional dance techniques into the mainstream of modern North American dance suggests either that social scientists may not have understood dance traditions or may not have been well-versed in dance traditions.
  The passage does not suggest that "most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it," "Most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology," or "Dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection."
  Therefore, the most likely answer is B: "Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of dance-isolation, her background in anthropology, and her research-to-performance method for adapting Caribbean dance forms into new ballets. 
  The peers mentioned in line 22 are social scientists.
Thought:
  The passage indicates that dance had previously been neglected as an area of social research because social scientists often gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as scientifically rigorous. 
  The peers mentioned in line 22 would therefore likely agree with a statement that suggests dance had not been a worthy area of social research.
  One statement that might suggest this is choice B: "Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them."
  This statement suggests that social scientists can still obtain reliable data about dance without being well-versed in dance traditions, and thus, dance may not be viewed as a legitimate area of social research. 
Criticism: 
  Choice B does not necessarily suggest that dance is not a legitimate area of social research, just that being well-versed in dance traditions is not a requirement for obtaining reliable data.
  There is no evidence to suggest whether the peers in line 22 would agree or disagree with choice A, C, D, or E.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of a dance technique known as dance-isolation, as well as her work as an anthropologist and choreographer in adapting traditional Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance.
  The peers mentioned in line 22 are social scientists who did not value dance as an area of social research.
Thought: 
  According to the passage, the peers mentioned in line 22 did not value dance as an area of social research.
  The passage also mentions that dance had been neglected as an area of social research.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that "Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them."
  This is because they did not value dance as an area of research and likely believed that there were other areas of research that were more important.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's contribution to North American dance by introducing dance-isolation and traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures.
  Dunham was an anthropologist who conducted research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms in the 1930s with a special interest in their origins in African culture.
Thought:
  Social scientists did not consider the study of dance as an area of social research because most of them gravitated toward areas befitting scientifically rigorous and legitimate modes of inquiry.
  The passage suggests that this neglect was due to social scientists' limited understanding of dance techniques, and experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research.
  Other anthropologists encouraged Dunham not to become too involved in the dances she was observing, nor to participate in the dances herself.
  Dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures were incorporated into modern North American dance in part because of Dunham's training in anthropological research as well as choreography.
  The passage does not suggest that dance cannot be studied through a high degree of scientific precision or that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Social scientists need not be well-versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the pioneering work of Katherine Dunham as an anthropologist studying dance ethnology.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time, which involved complete detachment from the subject.
Thought: 
  The "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with a statement reflecting the prevailing methodology at the time, which advocated complete detachment from the subject of study to obtain reliable data.
  Therefore, the peers would have most likely agreed with statement B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not suggest that Dunham's colleagues agreed with the prevailing methodology of complete detachment advocated by peers. Rather, Dunham's colleagues advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  Therefore, while statement B is a possibility, it cannot be definitively concluded as the most accurate reflection of the views of Dunham's peers.

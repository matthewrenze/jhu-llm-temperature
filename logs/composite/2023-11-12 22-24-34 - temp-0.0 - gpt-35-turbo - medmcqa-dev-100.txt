Question: Obstructive sleep apnoea caused by the following
Choices:
  A: Mandibular ameloblasma
  B: Dentigerous cyst
  C: Orbital fracture
  D: Bilateral TMJ ankylosis
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  A: Mandibular ameloblastoma is a benign tumor that arises from the odontogenic epithelium.
  B: Dentigerous cyst is a type of odontogenic cyst that is associated with the crown of an unerupted tooth.
  C: Orbital fracture is a break in one or more of the bones surrounding the eye.
  D: Bilateral TMJ ankylosis is a condition in which there is a fusion of the mandibular condyle with the temporal bone, resulting in limited mouth opening.
Thought:
  Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition in which there is a partial or complete blockage of the airway during sleep.
  Mandibular ameloblastoma and dentigerous cyst are both benign tumors that arise from the odontogenic epithelium and are unlikely to cause obstructive sleep apnea.
  Orbital fracture is a break in the bones surrounding the eye and is also unlikely to cause obstructive sleep apnea.
  Bilateral TMJ ankylosis can cause limited mouth opening, which can lead to obstructive sleep apnea.
  Therefore, the most likely cause of obstructive sleep apnea among the given options is D: Bilateral TMJ ankylosis.
Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct. Bilateral TMJ ankylosis can cause limited mouth opening, which can lead to obstructive sleep apnea.
  However, it is important to note that there are many other causes of obstructive sleep apnea, such as obesity, enlarged tonsils, and a deviated nasal septum, among others.

Topic: Medicine
Question: A 60 years old patient who had myocardial infarction 2 weeks back, the lipid profile is done for a patient and reveals HDL 32 mgldL, LDL 126 mg/dl, TG 276 mgl/dL. Which of the following is preferred for this patient ?
Choices:
  A: Rosuvastatin + Fenofibrate
  B: Fenofibrate alone
  C: Rosuvastatin 10 mg
  D: Atorvastatin 80 mg
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  HDL is considered as good cholesterol, and higher levels of HDL are desirable.
  LDL is considered as bad cholesterol, and lower levels of LDL are desirable.
  TG (triglycerides) are a type of fat found in the blood, and higher levels of TG are undesirable.
  Patients with a history of myocardial infarction are at high risk of cardiovascular events.
Thought:
  The patient has low HDL, high LDL, and high TG levels.
  Statins are the first-line therapy for reducing LDL levels.
  Fibrates are used to reduce TG levels and increase HDL levels.
  Combination therapy with statins and fibrates may be considered in patients with high TG and low HDL levels.
  However, combination therapy may increase the risk of adverse effects.
  Therefore, monotherapy with a statin or a fibrate may be preferred.
  In this case, the patient has low HDL levels, high LDL levels, and high TG levels.
  Rosuvastatin is a potent statin that can reduce LDL levels by up to 60%.
  Atorvastatin is another potent statin that can reduce LDL levels by up to 50%.
  Fenofibrate is a fibrate that can reduce TG levels by up to 50% and increase HDL levels by up to 20%.
  Based on the patient's lipid profile, a fibrate alone may not be sufficient to improve the patient's lipid levels.
  Therefore, a statin may be preferred.

### Exam: medmcqa-dev-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Pediatrics
Question: Short child with low T4 and raised TSH and swelling of pituitary, what is the diangosis ?
Choices:
  A: Primary hypothyrodism
  B: Pituitary tumor
  C: TSH Secreting pituitary adenoma
  D: TSH resistance
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  T4 is a thyroid hormone that is produced by the thyroid gland.
  TSH is a hormone that is produced by the pituitary gland and stimulates the thyroid gland to produce T4.
  Primary hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone.
  Pituitary tumor is a mass that grows in the pituitary gland.
  TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma is a type of pituitary tumor that produces excess TSH.
  TSH resistance is a rare genetic disorder where the thyroid gland is resistant to the effects of TSH.
Thought:
  The child is short, which suggests a growth problem.
  The low T4 and raised TSH suggest hypothyroidism.
  The swelling of the pituitary suggests a pituitary problem.
  A pituitary tumor could cause the pituitary gland to produce excess TSH, but it would not explain the low T4.
  TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma could cause both the raised TSH and the swelling of the pituitary, but it would not explain the low T4.
  Primary hypothyroidism could explain the low T4 and raised TSH, but it would not explain the swelling of the pituitary.
  TSH resistance is unlikely because it is a rare genetic disorder and not commonly seen.
  Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a pituitary tumor, specifically a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma.

Thought:
  The child is short, which suggests a growth problem.
  The low T4 and raised TSH suggest hypothyroidism.
  The swelling of the pituitary suggests a pituitary problem.
  A pituitary tumor could cause the pituitary gland to produce excess TSH, but it would not explain the low T4.
  TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma could cause both the raised TSH and the swelling of the pituitary, but it would not explain the low T4.
  Primary hypothyroidism could explain the low T4 and raised TSH, but it would not explain the swelling of the pituitary.

Topic: Dental
Question: Which of the following show chemical bond with enamel (calcified tissues)?
Choices:
  A: Composites
  B: Direct filling resins
  C: Polycarboxylate cements
  D: BIS-GMA resins in pit and fissure sealants
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Enamel is the hard, calcified tissue that covers the outer layer of the tooth.
  A: Composites are a type of dental material that is used to restore teeth. They are made of a mixture of resin and filler particles.
  B: Direct filling resins are a type of composite material that is used to fill cavities in teeth.
  C: Polycarboxylate cements are a type of dental cement that is used to bond restorative materials to teeth.
  D: BIS-GMA resins are a type of dental material that is used in pit and fissure sealants to prevent tooth decay.
Thought:
  Enamel is a calcified tissue, so it is likely that the material that bonds to it would also be a calcified material.
  A, B, and D are all composite materials, which are made of a mixture of resin and filler particles. It is possible that these materials could bond to enamel.
  C is a type of dental cement, which may not bond as well to enamel as composite materials.
  Therefore, A, B, and D are more likely to bond with enamel than C.
  The answer is either A, B, or D.
Criticism:
  Enamel is a highly mineralized tissue, so it is unlikely that any material would form a true chemical bond with it.
  Instead, dental materials form a mechanical bond with enamel by interlocking with the irregularities on the surface of the tooth.
  Therefore, the question is somewhat misleading, as no dental material truly forms a chemical bond with enamel.

  Pulp capping is a dental procedure used to prevent the death of dental pulp after an injury or exposure.
  Primary teeth are the first set of teeth that develop in a child and are eventually replaced by permanent teeth.
  A: Odontoblasts are cells that form dentin, which is the hard, mineralized tissue that makes up the bulk of the tooth. Increased odontoblastic activity in the young may contribute to the success of pulpectomy and pulp capping.
  B: Blood supply is important for the healing process, but it is not necessarily a factor that contributes to the success of pulpectomy and pulp capping.
  C: The volume of pulp in primary teeth is smaller than in permanent teeth, which may make it easier to perform pulpectomy and pulp capping, but it is not necessarily a factor that contributes to their success.
  D: Collagen fibers are a component of the extracellular matrix of dental pulp. The amount of collagen fibers in young teeth is not necessarily a factor that contributes to the success of pulpectomy and pulp capping.

Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 10
  C: 12
  D: 15
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  GCS stands for Glasgow Coma Scale, which is used to assess the level of consciousness of a patient.
  The GCS score ranges from 3 to 15, with 3 being the worst possible score and 15 being the best possible score.
  Endotracheal intubation is a procedure in which a tube is inserted through the mouth or nose into the trachea to help a patient breathe.
Thought: 
  Endotracheal intubation is usually done in patients who are not able to breathe on their own.
  Such patients are likely to have a low GCS score, indicating a decreased level of consciousness.
  A GCS score of 8 or lower indicates severe brain injury, which may be the reason for the need for endotracheal intubation.
  Therefore, the most likely GCS score of a patient who sustained A and underwent endotracheal intubation would be A: 8.
Criticism: 
  The question does not provide enough information about the nature of injury sustained by the patient.
  The GCS score is affected by various factors, including eye opening, verbal response, and motor response.
  The score may also be affected by the use of sedatives or other medications.
  Therefore, it is difficult to determine the most likely GCS score of a patient based solely on the fact that they underwent endotracheal intubation.

### Exam: medmcqa-dev-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Gynaecology & Obstetrics
Question: A primigravida came to the labor room at 40 weeks + 5 days gestation for induction of labor. On per vaginal examination, the cervix is 1 cm dilated and 30% effaced. The veex is at --1 station and the cervix is soft and posterior. What will be the modified bishop score for this lady?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 3
  C: 5
  D: 8
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The Bishop score is used to assess the readiness of the cervix for induction of labor.
  The Bishop score is calculated based on five components: cervical dilation, cervical effacement, cervical consistency, cervical position, and fetal station.
  Each component is scored from 0 to 2, with a maximum possible score of 10.
  A score of 8 or higher indicates that the cervix is favorable for induction of labor.
Thought:
  Cervical dilation: 1 cm (score 0)
  Cervical effacement: 30% (score 0)
  Cervical consistency: soft (score 2)
  Cervical position: posterior (score 0)
  Fetal station: -1 (score 1)
  Total Bishop score: 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 3
  The modified Bishop score is the same as the original Bishop score, so the answer is B: 3.

Topic: Pharmacology
Question: Digoxin is obtained from a plant product and has a half-life of 36 hours. How does this information help us in formulating treatment?
Choices:
  A: To adjust maintenance dose of digoxin required to keep the blood levels within therapeutic range
  B: Intravenous administration in emergency and urgent dosing
  C: Long half-life permits altemate day dosing
  D: It requires a high loading dose to be administered
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Digoxin is a medication used to treat heart failure and atrial fibrillation.
  Digoxin is obtained from the foxglove plant.
  Digoxin has a half-life of 36 hours, which means that it takes 36 hours for half of the drug to be eliminated from the body.
Thought: 
  Digoxin has a long half-life of 36 hours.
  This means that it takes a longer time for the drug to be eliminated from the body.
  Therefore, it is possible to administer digoxin less frequently, such as every other day.
  This can be helpful in patients who have difficulty adhering to a daily medication regimen.
  Additionally, the long half-life can help in adjusting the maintenance dose of digoxin required to keep the blood levels within therapeutic range.
  However, it does not necessarily mean that a high loading dose is required or that intravenous administration is necessary.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Long half-life permits alternate day dosing.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence to suggest that a high loading dose is required or that intravenous administration is necessary based solely on the long half-life of digoxin.
  Additionally, while the long half-life can help in adjusting the maintenance dose, it is not the only factor to consider.

### Exam: medmcqa-dev-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Dental
Question: Multi constricted apical constriction is seen in which type of Dummer’s classification
Choices:
  A: Type 1
  B: Type 2
  C: Type 3
  D: Type 4
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Dummer's classification is a classification system for root canal morphology.
  Type 1: A single canal from the pulp chamber to the apex.
  Type 2: Two separate canals leaving the pulp chamber and merging short of the apex to form one canal.
  Type 3: Two separate canals leaving the pulp chamber and remaining separate throughout the root.
  Type 4: Two separate canals leaving the pulp chamber and rejoining in the apical third to exit as one canal.
  Multi constricted apical constriction refers to the presence of multiple apical foramina or constrictions at the apex of the root.
Thought:
  Multi constricted apical constriction is not a feature of Type 1 or Type 2 canals, which have only one canal or one canal that merges before the apex.
  Type 3 canals have two separate canals that remain separate throughout the root, so it is possible that each canal could have its own apical constriction.
  Type 4 canals have two canals that rejoin in the apical third, so it is possible that there could be multiple apical constrictions or foramina in this type of canal.
  Therefore, multi constricted apical constriction is most likely seen in Type 3 or Type 4 canals.
  The answer is either C: Type 3 or D: Type 4.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is sound, but it is not definitive. 
  Multi constricted apical constriction can occur in any type of canal, not just Type 3 or Type 4.

  Type 1: A single canal from the pulp chamber to the apex.
  Type 2: Two separate canals leaving the pulp chamber and merging short of the apex to form one canal.
  Type 3: Two separate canals leaving the pulp chamber and remaining separate throughout the root.
  Type 4: Two separate canals leaving the pulp chamber and rejoining in the apical third to exit as one canal.
  Multi constricted apical constriction refers to the presence of multiple apical foramina or constrictions at the apex of the root.
Thought:
  Multi constricted apical constriction is not a feature of Type 1 or Type 2 canals, which have only one canal or one canal that merges before the apex.
  Type 3 canals have two separate canals that remain separate throughout the root, so it is possible that each canal could have its own apical constriction.
  Type 4 canals have two canals that rejoin in the apical third, so it is possible that there could be multiple apical constrictions or foramina in this type of canal.
  Therefore, multi constricted apical constriction is most likely seen in Type 3 or Type 4 canals.
  The answer is either C: Type 3 or D: Type 4.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is sound, but it is not definitive. 
  Multi constricted apical constriction can occur in any type of canal, not just Type 3 or Type 4.
  Therefore, the answer cannot be determined with certainty.
Action: Answer("None of the above")

  B: Glycogenolysis
  C: TCA cycle
  D: Phosphocreatine
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  ATP is the primary source of energy for muscle contraction.
  A: Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose to produce ATP.
  B: Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen to produce glucose, which can then be used in glycolysis to produce ATP.
  C: TCA cycle is a series of chemical reactions used by cells to generate energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.
  D: Phosphocreatine is a molecule that can rapidly regenerate ATP by donating a phosphate group to ADP.
Thought:
  The question is asking for a rapid source of energy for exercising muscles.
  Glycolysis and glycogenolysis both produce ATP, but they take longer to produce ATP than phosphocreatine.
  TCA cycle is not a rapid source of energy because it requires the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, or proteins to produce acetyl-CoA, which then enters the TCA cycle.
  Phosphocreatine is a molecule that can rapidly regenerate ATP by donating a phosphate group to ADP.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Phosphocreatine.
Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct. Phosphocreatine is a rapid source of energy for exercising muscles.
  However, it is important to note that phosphocreatine can only provide energy for a short period of time (about 10 seconds) before other energy systems, such as glycolysis, take over.

### Exam: medmcqa-dev-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Pediatrics
Question: A neonate presents with jaundice and clay coloured stools. Liver biopsy shows giant cells diagnosis is –
Choices:
  A: Neonatal hepatitis with physiological jaundice
  B: Neonatal hepatitis with extrahepatic biliary atresia
  C: Physiological jaundice
  D: Physiological jaundice with extrahepatic biliary atresia
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood.
  Clay-colored stools are pale, white, or light-colored stools that are not normal and may be a sign of a liver problem.
  A liver biopsy is a medical procedure that involves taking a small sample of liver tissue for examination under a microscope.
  Giant cells are large cells with multiple nuclei that are often seen in viral infections and autoimmune diseases.
Thought:
  The neonate has jaundice and clay-colored stools, which are signs of a liver problem.
  The liver biopsy shows giant cells, which are often seen in viral infections and autoimmune diseases.
  Therefore, the neonate likely has a liver disease that is causing the jaundice and clay-colored stools, and the giant cells suggest a viral infection or autoimmune disease.
  Option A suggests neonatal hepatitis with physiological jaundice, but the presence of giant cells suggests a more severe liver disease than just physiological jaundice.
  Option B suggests neonatal hepatitis with extrahepatic biliary atresia, which is a congenital condition where the bile ducts outside the liver are blocked or absent. This can cause jaundice and clay-colored stools, but giant cells are not typically seen in this condition.
  Option C suggests physiological jaundice, which is a common and usually harmless condition in newborns. However, the presence of clay-colored stools suggests a more severe liver problem than just physiological jaundice.
  Option D suggests physiological jaundice with extrahepatic biliary atresia, which is not a recognized medical condition.
  Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the information given is neonatal hepatitis with a viral or autoimmune etiology.

  Option B suggests neonatal hepatitis with extrahepatic biliary atresia, which is a congenital condition where the bile ducts outside the liver are blocked or absent. This can cause jaundice and clay-colored stools, but giant cells are not typically seen in this condition.
  Option C suggests physiological jaundice, which is a common and usually harmless condition in newborns. However, the presence of clay-colored stools suggests a more severe liver problem than just physiological jaundice.
  Option D suggests physiological jaundice with extrahepatic biliary atresia, which is not a recognized medical condition.
  Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the information given is neonatal hepatitis with a viral or autoimmune etiology.

### Exam: medmcqa-dev-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Pharmacology
Question: A 70 years old hypeensive patient with stage 5 chronic kidney disease was diagnosed recently with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. He doesn't want to take injectable insulin. Which of the following oral hypoglycemic agents will be preferred in this patient, which won't require any renal dose modification?
Choices:
  A: Linagliptin
  B: Repaglinide
  C: Vildagliptin
  D: Glimepiride
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common comorbidity in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
  In CKD, the renal function is impaired, which can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs.
  Some oral hypoglycemic agents require renal dose adjustment in CKD.
  A: Linagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that is primarily excreted through the bile and does not require renal dose adjustment.
  B: Repaglinide is a meglitinide that is metabolized in the liver and does not require renal dose adjustment.
  C: Vildagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that is primarily excreted through the kidneys and requires renal dose adjustment.
  D: Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea that is metabolized in the liver and requires renal dose adjustment.
Thought: 
  The patient has stage 5 CKD, which means that the renal function is severely impaired.
  The patient does not want to take injectable insulin, so an oral hypoglycemic agent is preferred.
  Linagliptin and Repaglinide do not require renal dose adjustment and can be used in patients with CKD.
  Vildagliptin and Glimepiride require renal dose adjustment and may not be suitable for this patient.
  Therefore, either A: Linagliptin or B: Repaglinide can be used in this patient.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.
  Both Linagliptin and Repaglinide can be used in patients with CKD without requiring renal dose adjustment.

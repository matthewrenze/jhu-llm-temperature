Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The width of the paper is 50cm (0.5m).
  The cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter.
  An area of 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows.

Thought:
  Let the height of the room be 2x meters and the semi-perimeter be 5x meters.
  The area of the walls to be papered is equal to the semi-perimeter multiplied by the height minus the area for doors and windows.
  Area = (5x * 2x) - 15 sq.m
  The cost of papering the walls is equal to the area multiplied by the cost per square meter.
  The cost per square meter is Rs.2 per meter divided by the width of the paper (0.5m).
  Cost per square meter = Rs.4
  The total cost of papering the walls is equal to the area multiplied by the cost per square meter.
  260 = (5x * 2x - 15) * 4

Step-by-step:
  1. Divide both sides of the equation by 4.
     65 = 5x * 2x - 15
  2. Simplify the equation.
     65 = 10x^2 - 15
  3. Add 15 to both sides of the equation.
     80 = 10x^2
  4. Divide both sides of the equation by 10.
     8 = x^2
  5. Take the square root of both sides of the equation.
     x = sqrt(8)
  6. Calculate the value of x.
     x ≈ 2.83
  7. Calculate the height of the room (2x).
     Height ≈ 2 * 2.83 ≈ 5.66m

Criticism:
  The calculated height of the room (5.66m) is not one of the available choices. There might be an error in the calculations or the given information.

Revised Thought:
  Since the calculated height is not one of the available choices, let's try to find the most likely answer by comparing the calculated height to the given choices.

  A: 2.6m is less than the calculated height (5.66m).
  B: 3.9m is less than the calculated height (5.66m).

  Area = (5x * 2x) - 15 sq.m
  The cost of papering the walls is equal to the area multiplied by the cost per square meter.
  260 = ((5x * 2x) - 15) * (2 / 0.5)
  Solve for x to find the height of the room.

Criticism:
  The thought process is correct, but the formula for the area of the walls to be papered should be the perimeter multiplied by the height, not the semi-perimeter.

Thought (revised):
  Let the height of the room be 2x meters and the perimeter be 10x meters.
  The area of the walls to be papered is equal to the perimeter multiplied by the height minus the area for doors and windows.
  Area = (10x * 2x) - 15 sq.m
  The cost of papering the walls is equal to the area multiplied by the cost per square meter.
  260 = ((10x * 2x) - 15) * (2 / 0.5)
  Solve for x to find the height of the room.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well?
Choices:
  A: 25 days
  B: 26 days
  C: 27 days
  D: 28 days
  E: 29 days
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The frog jumps 3m up and falls back 2m down each day.
  The net gain per day is 3m - 2m = 1m.
  The well is 30m deep.

Thought:
  The frog gains 1m in height each day.
  To reach the top of the well, the frog needs to gain 30m in height.
  Let's assume it takes 'x' days for the frog to reach the top.

  On the last day, when the frog jumps 3m up, it will be out of the well and will not fall back 2m.
  So, for the first (x-1) days, the frog gains 1m each day, and on the last day, it gains 3m.

  The total height gained by the frog in 'x' days can be represented as:
  (x-1) * 1m + 3m = 30m

  Solving for 'x':
  x - 1 + 3 = 30
  x + 2 = 30
  x = 28

  Therefore, it takes the frog 28 days to come out of the well.

Criticism:
  The facts, logic, and reasoning are correct.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?
Choices:
  A: 300
  B: 500
  C: 5000
  D: 6000
  E: 7500
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The problem involves the concept of proportions.
  The proportion of tagged deer in the sample is representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.

Thought:
  Let x be the total deer population in the forest.
  In 2001, 300 deer were tagged.
  In 2002, 500 deer were caught, and 20 of them were tagged.
  The proportion of tagged deer in the sample is 20/500.
  The proportion of tagged deer in the entire population is 300/x.
  We can set up the proportion equation: (20/500) = (300/x).

Criticism:
  The facts, logic, and reasoning are correct.

Step-by-step solution:

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: What should come in place of the question mark(?) in each of the following questions ?
a2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?)=(a - b)2
Choices:
  A: (a + b)(a - b)
  B: (a - b)2
  C: (a + b)2
  D: a3 + b3
  E: None of these
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  a² - b² is the difference of squares, which can be factored as (a + b)(a - b).
  (a + b)² is the square of the sum of a and b, which can be expanded as a² + 2ab + b².
  (a - b)² is the square of the difference of a and b, which can be expanded as a² - 2ab + b².

Thought:
  We are given the equation: (a² - b²) / (a + b)² = (?)
  We want to find the expression that should replace the question mark.

  Step 1: Factor the numerator (a² - b²) as (a + b)(a - b).
  So, the equation becomes: ((a + b)(a - b)) / (a + b)² = (?)

  Step 2: Observe that (a + b) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator.
  So, we can cancel out (a + b) from both the numerator and the denominator.
  The equation becomes: (a - b) / (a + b) = (?)

  Step 3: Compare the given equation with the choices.

  A: (a + b)(a - b) does not match the simplified equation.
  B: (a - b)² does not match the simplified equation.
  C: (a + b)² does not match the simplified equation.
  D: a³ + b³ does not match the simplified equation.

  None of the given choices match the simplified equation (a - b) / (a + b).

Criticism:
  The simplified equation (a - b) / (a + b) does not match any of the given choices.
  However, we must select the most likely answer.

  The closest choice to the simplified equation is B: (a - b)², as it contains the (a - b) term.

  Step 2: Cancel out the common factor (a + b) from the numerator and denominator.
  So, the equation becomes: (a - b) / (a + b) = (?)

  Step 3: Multiply both sides of the equation by (a + b) to isolate the question mark.
  So, the equation becomes: (a - b) = (?) * (a + b)

  Step 4: Compare the equation with the given choices.

  A: (a + b)(a - b) does not match the equation.
  B: (a - b)² does not match the equation.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We are given the following information:
  - 75% of employees take a winter vacation.
  - 40% of employees take both a winter and summer vacation.
  - 20% of employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

Thought:
  Let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.
  1. Total employees taking at least one vacation = Employees taking a winter vacation + Employees taking a summer vacation - Employees taking both vacations.
  2. Let X be the percentage of employees taking a summer vacation.
  3. We want to find the percentage of employees taking a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, which is (X - 40%).

Step-by-step:
  1. Total employees taking at least one vacation = 100% - 20% (neither) = 80%.
  2. 80% = 75% (winter) + X (summer) - 40% (both).
  3. X = 80% - 75% + 40% = 45% (summer vacation takers).
  4. Summer vacation takers but not winter vacation takers = 45% - 40% = 5%.

Criticism:
  The facts, logic, and reasoning are correct.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 3
  C: 2
  D: 1
  E: 0
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Copper coin value: 20 cents
  Brass coin value: 25 cents
  Total earnings: $3.40

Thought:
  Let x be the number of copper coins and y be the number of brass coins.
  The total earnings equation can be written as:
  20x + 25y = 340 (since $3.40 is equal to 340 cents)

  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins (x) that she brought.

  Since the value of a brass coin is greater than the value of a copper coin, to minimize the number of copper coins, we need to maximize the number of brass coins.

Criticism:
  The thought process is correct, and we need to find the minimum number of copper coins (x) while maximizing the number of brass coins (y).

Step-by-step:
  1. Start with the highest possible number of brass coins (y) that can be part of the solution.
  2. Check if the remaining amount can be covered by copper coins (x).
  3. If not, decrease the number of brass coins (y) by 1 and repeat step 2.
  4. Continue this process until a valid solution is found.

Solution:
  1. Start with y = 13 (since 13 * 25 = 325, which is the highest multiple of 25 less than 340).
  2. Check if the remaining amount (340 - 325 = 15) can be covered by copper coins. Since 15 is not divisible by 20, this is not a valid solution.
  3. Decrease y by 1 (y = 12) and repeat step 2. Now, 12 * 25 = 300, and the remaining amount is 40. Since 40 is divisible by 20, this is a valid solution.
  4. The minimum number of copper coins (x) is 40 / 20 = 2.

  2. For 13 brass coins, the remaining amount is 340 - 325 = 15 cents. This can be covered by 3 copper coins (3 * 20 = 60, which is greater than 15).
  3. Decrease the number of brass coins to 12 (12 * 25 = 300). The remaining amount is 340 - 300 = 40 cents. This can be covered by 2 copper coins (2 * 20 = 40).

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100%
Choices:
  A: 41.86%
  B: 42.86%
  C: 43.86%
  D: 44.86%
  E: 45.86%
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  A percentage decrease of 30% means the product is now at 70% of its original price.
  To find the percentage increase needed to make it 100%, we need to find the difference between the original price and the reduced price.

Thought:
  Let the original price be x.
  After a 30% reduction, the price is now 0.7x.
  We need to find the percentage increase (y) such that 0.7x * (1 + y) = x.

Step-by-step:
  1. Divide both sides of the equation by 0.7x: (1 + y) = x / 0.7x

Response 1:
Knowledge:
  A percentage decrease of 30% means the product is now at 70% of its original price.
  To find the percentage increase needed to make it 100%, we need to find the difference between the original price and the reduced price.

Thought:
  Let the original price be x.
  After a 30% reduction, the price is now 0.7x.
  We need to find the percentage increase (y) such that 0.7x * (1 + y) = x.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Researchers in a country reported that they found meteorites about 200 million years old in the strata of a certain area, and they were probably traces of flying objects when a huge meteorite hit the present province of Quebec, Canada.The clay layer with a thickness of about 5 cm also contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are 50 to 2000 times the concentration normally found on the ground.In addition, this rock also contains special minerals in the formation of the late Bacques.Since the upper and lower strata also contain marine plankton fossils, it can be determined that the impact period was about 215 million years ago.
Question: Which of the following, if true, would best support the above research findings?
Choices:
  A: The rock was formed after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground
  B: In the late Paleozoic Triassic (approximately 200 million to 237 million years ago) ammonite and other species were extinct on a large scale
  C: Elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface
  D: In ancient times, there have been many incidents of meteorite impacting the earth

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: The traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.There is no other explanation.The fiction says that the Eight Diagrams are named after the name of an object, For example, Qiangua is the heaven, and Qian is the ancient Chinese character, so it is named Qian; in the sense of meaning, the image of hexagrams represents the principle of things, and its rationality is taken as the name of a hexagram.The Lord is supple, so the hexagram is Kun, and Kun is the meaning of suppleness
Question: Which of the following statements is true, which most seriously shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name?
Choices:
  A: The reason why the two hexagrams of Qiankun ranks first among the sixty-four hexagrams is because the Qian gua represents heaven and the Kun gua represents earth.
  B: The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone.Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names
  C: Although there are many different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, it is inseparable from its sect, either attributed to the theory of fetching images, or attributed to the theory of fetching meanings
  D: The name of the hexagram comes from the account of the narration of the hexagram.Kun Guazhan asked about the loss of the horse.At the beginning, he had three elephants.He believed that the horse could be found and was named Kun.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: There are 6 singers? F, G, L, K, H, M.3 piano accompaniment? X, Y, W.Each piano accompanimentist happened to accompany two of the singers.Known condition information is as follows? (1) If X is F accompaniment, then W is L accompaniment.(2) If X is not a G accompaniment, then Y is an M accompaniment.(3) X or Y is H accompaniment.(4) F and G do not share accompaniment; L and K do not share accompaniment; H and M do not share accompaniment.
Question: It is impossible for Y to accompany the following pair of singers?
Choices:
  A: G and H
  B: L and H
  C: F and L
  D: F and M
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are 6 singers: F, G, L, K, H, M.
  There are 3 piano accompanimentists: X, Y, W.
  Each piano accompanimentist accompanies two of the singers.
  Conditions:
    1) If X is F accompaniment, then W is L accompaniment.
    2) If X is not a G accompaniment, then Y is an M accompaniment.
    3) X or Y is H accompaniment.
    4) F and G do not share accompaniment; L and K do not share accompaniment; H and M do not share accompaniment.

Thought:
  We need to find the pair of singers that Y cannot accompany based on the given conditions.

  A: G and H
    If Y accompanies G and H, then X must accompany F and M (since F and G do not share accompaniment, and H and M do not share accompaniment). This would mean that W accompanies L and K. This scenario does not violate any conditions, so it is possible.

  B: L and H
    If Y accompanies L and H, then X must accompany F and G (since L and K do not share accompaniment, and F and G do not share accompaniment). This would mean that W accompanies K and M. This scenario does not violate any conditions, so it is possible.

  C: F and L
    If Y accompanies F and L, then X must accompany G and H (since F and G do not share accompaniment, and L and K do not share accompaniment). This would mean that W accompanies K and M. However, this scenario violates condition 1 (If X is F accompaniment, then W is L accompaniment). Therefore, it is impossible for Y to accompany F and L.

  D: F and M
    If Y accompanies F and M, then X must accompany G and H (since F and G do not share accompaniment, and H and M do not share accompaniment). This would mean that W accompanies L and K. This scenario does not violate any conditions, so it is possible.

Criticism:
  The thought process is correct, and the analysis of each choice is accurate based on the given conditions.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are 6 singers: F, G, L, K, H, M.
  There are 3 piano accompanists: X, Y, W.
  Each accompanist accompanies two singers.
  Conditions:
    1) If X is F's accompanist, then W is L's accompanist.
    2) If X is not G's accompanist, then Y is M's accompanist.
    3) X or Y is H's accompanist.
    4) F and G do not share an accompanist; L and K do not share an accompanist; H and M do not share an accompanist.

Thought:
  We need to find the pair of singers that Y cannot accompany.
  Let's analyze each choice:

  A: G and H
    If Y accompanies G and H, then X must accompany F and L (since H and M cannot share an accompanist). This would mean W accompanies K and M. This arrangement satisfies all conditions, so it is possible.

  B: L and H
    If Y accompanies L and H, then X must accompany F and G (since L and K cannot share an accompanist). This would mean W accompanies K and M. This arrangement satisfies all conditions, so it is possible.

  C: F and L
    If Y accompanies F and L, then X must accompany G and H (since F and G cannot share an accompanist). This would mean W accompanies K and M. However, this arrangement violates condition 1 (if X is F's accompanist, then W is L's accompanist). So, it is impossible for Y to accompany F and L.

  D: F and M
    If Y accompanies F and M, then X must accompany G and H (since H and M cannot share an accompanist). This would mean W accompanies L and K. This arrangement satisfies all conditions, so it is possible.

Criticism:
  The analysis of each choice is correct, and the logic is sound.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: About 12,000 years ago, when the climate warmed, humans began to come to North America.At the same time, large mammals, such as mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers, became extinct from their once widespread North American soil.Therefore, contrary to the myth that humans lived in peace with other creatures in nature, as early as 12,000 years ago, human activities led to the extinction of these animals.
Question: Which of the following statements is the most vulnerable to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: This argument excludes humanity from nature without reflection.
  B: The arrival of humans in North America may also lead to the extinction of animals other than mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers.
  C: The extinction of large mammals such as mastodons, mammoths and saber-toothed tigers was of extraordinary significance to the primitive people of early North America.
  D: The evidence presented is equally applicable to two alternative hypotheses? climate change has led to the extinction of large mammals, and the same reasons have led humans to travel across North America.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The argument states that humans arrived in North America around 12,000 years ago when the climate warmed.
- The argument also states that large mammals like mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers became extinct around the same time.
- The argument concludes that human activities led to the extinction of these animals, contrary to the myth that humans lived in peace with other creatures in nature.

Thought:
- We need to identify the statement that is most vulnerable to the argument.

A: This argument excludes humanity from nature without reflection.
- This statement criticizes the argument for separating humans from nature, but it does not directly address the argument's conclusion about human activities causing the extinction of large mammals.

B: The arrival of humans in North America may also lead to the extinction of animals other than mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers.
- This statement expands on the argument's conclusion, suggesting that humans may have caused the extinction of other animals as well. However, it does not challenge the argument's logic or conclusion.

C: The extinction of large mammals such as mastodons, mammoths and saber-toothed tigers was of extraordinary significance to the primitive people of early North America.
- This statement discusses the significance of the extinction of large mammals to early North Americans, but it does not challenge the argument's logic or conclusion.

D: The evidence presented is equally applicable to two alternative hypotheses: climate change has led to the extinction of large mammals, and the same reasons have led humans to travel across North America.
- This statement challenges the argument's conclusion by suggesting that climate change could have caused both the extinction of large mammals and the migration of humans to North America. This alternative hypothesis weakens the argument's conclusion that human activities led to the extinction of these animals.

Criticism:
- The argument assumes that the arrival of humans and the extinction of large mammals are causally related, but it does not provide direct evidence for this claim.
- Statement D presents an alternative hypothesis that challenges the argument's conclusion, making it the most vulnerable statement.

C: The extinction of large mammals such as mastodons, mammoths and saber-toothed tigers was of extraordinary significance to the primitive people of early North America.
- This statement discusses the significance of the extinction of large mammals to early North Americans, but it does not challenge the argument's logic or conclusion.

D: The evidence presented is equally applicable to two alternative hypotheses: climate change has led to the extinction of large mammals, and the same reasons have led humans to travel across North America.
- This statement challenges the argument's conclusion by suggesting that climate change could have caused both the extinction of large mammals and the migration of humans to North America. This alternative hypothesis weakens the argument's conclusion that human activities led to the extinction of these animals.

Criticism:
- The argument assumes that the arrival of humans and the extinction of large mammals are causally related, but it does not provide direct evidence for this claim.
- Statement D presents an alternative hypothesis that challenges the argument's conclusion, making it the most vulnerable statement.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: A theater plans to perform 7 repertoires in the 7 weeks of the fall, they are F, G., J, K, O, R, S.One repertoire is performed every week, and each repertoire is exactly one week.The repertoire must meet the following conditions? (1) G must be performed in the third week.(2) O and S cannot perform continuously.(3) K must be arranged before J and S.(4) F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.
Question: If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then which week must R be scheduled?
Choices:
  A: the second week
  B: Fourth week
  C: fifth week
  D: Seventh week
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 repertoires: F, G, J, K, O, R, S.
  There are 7 weeks, and each repertoire is performed exactly once.
  The conditions are:
    1. G must be performed in the third week.
    2. O and S cannot perform continuously.
    3. K must be arranged before J and S.
    4. F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.

Thought:
  Given that S is scheduled for the sixth week, we can analyze the conditions:
    1. G is in the third week: _ _ G _ _ S _
    2. O and S cannot perform continuously, so O cannot be in the fifth week: _ _ G _ O S _
    3. K must be arranged before J and S, so K must be in one of the first four weeks: K _ G _ O S _ or _ K G _ O S _
    4. F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks. Since S is in the sixth week, F and J must be in the fourth and fifth weeks or the fifth and seventh weeks.

  If F and J are in the fourth and fifth weeks, the schedule would be: K _ G F J O S _
  If F and J are in the fifth and seventh weeks, the schedule would be: _ K G F O S J

  In both cases, the only available week for R is the second week.

Criticism:
  The logic and reasoning are correct, and all conditions are met in both possible schedules.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 repertoires: F, G, J, K, O, R, S.
  There are 7 weeks, and each repertoire is performed exactly once.
  The conditions are:
    1. G must be performed in the third week.
    2. O and S cannot perform continuously.
    3. K must be arranged before J and S.
    4. F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.

Thought:
  Given that S is scheduled for the sixth week, we can analyze the conditions:
    1. G is in the third week.
    2. O cannot be in the fifth or seventh week (due to condition 2).
    3. K must be before J and S, so K cannot be in the sixth or seventh week.
    4. F and J must be in consecutive weeks, so if J is in the fifth week, F must be in the fourth week or vice versa.

Analysis:
  Since O cannot be in the fifth or seventh week, it must be in the second week.
  This leaves only the fourth and fifth weeks for F and J, so F must be in the fourth week and J in the fifth week.
  K must be before J and S, so K must be in the first week.
  This leaves only the seventh week for R.

Criticism:
  The logic and reasoning are sound, and all conditions are met with this arrangement.

Action: Answer("D")

    2. O and S cannot perform continuously.
    3. K must be arranged before J and S.
    4. F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.

Thought:
  Given that S is scheduled for the sixth week, we can analyze the conditions:
    1. G is in the third week: _ _ G _ _ S _
    2. O and S cannot perform continuously, so O cannot be in the fifth week: _ _ G _ O S _
    3. K must be arranged before J and S, so K must be in one of the first four weeks: K _ G _ O S _ or _ K G _ O S _
    4. F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks. Since S is in the sixth week, F and J must be in the fourth and fifth weeks or the fifth and seventh weeks.

  If F and J are in the fourth and fifth weeks, the schedule would be: K _ G F J O S _
  If F and J are in the fifth and seventh weeks, the schedule would be: _ K G F O S J

  In both cases, the only available week for R is the second week.

    2. O and S cannot perform continuously.
    3. K must be arranged before J and S.
    4. F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.

Thought:
  Given that S is scheduled for the sixth week, we can analyze the conditions:
    1. G is in the third week: _ _ G _ _ S _
    2. O cannot be in the fifth week, as it cannot be continuous with S.
    3. K must be before J and S, so K can be in the first, second, or fourth week.
    4. F and J must be consecutive, so they can be in weeks 1-2, 2-3, 4-5, or 5-7.

Analysis:
  If K is in the first week, then F and J must be in weeks 2-3, but G is in the third week, so this is not possible.
  If K is in the second week, then F and J must be in weeks 4-5, which is possible.
  If K is in the fourth week, then F and J must be in weeks 1-2 or 5-7, but G is in the third week, so this is not possible.

  So, K must be in the second week, and F and J must be in weeks 4-5: K G F J O S _

    4. F and J must be in consecutive weeks, so if J is in the fifth week, F must be in the fourth week or vice versa.

Analysis:
  Since O cannot be in the fifth or seventh week, it must be in the second week.
  This leaves only the fourth and fifth weeks for F and J, so F must be in the fourth week and J in the fifth week.
  K must be before J and S, so K must be in the first week.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Zhang Qiang? When the economy in a region is sluggish, many people are unemployed, so they reduce their living expenses, resulting in more unemployment and worsening the economy.The economy continued to deteriorate, and finally prices fell to the lowest point.Low prices have stimulated people to increase their living consumption, and increased consumption has led to improved economic conditions.Li Ming? If people are unemployed, they will not be able to increase their consumption, nor will they have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.Therefore, falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
Question: If the following statement is true, which one can best weaken Li Ming's rebuttal to Zhang Qiang?
Choices:
  A: After the economic situation improves, the company will hire more people, and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed.
  B: Even if the economic situation continues to deteriorate, consumers still believe that the economic situation will eventually improve.
  C: Even when the economy is extremely deteriorating, the unemployed must continue to buy necessities such as food.
  D: During the period of economic deterioration, even unemployed people will compress expenditures; when prices fall to the lowest point, they will have savings for consumption.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Zhang Qiang's argument: Sluggish economy leads to unemployment, reduced living expenses, more unemployment, and worsening economy. Low prices stimulate increased consumption, leading to improved economic conditions.
  Li Ming's rebuttal: Unemployed people cannot increase consumption and will only buy necessities, so low prices will not lead to improved economic conditions.

Thought:
  We need to find a statement that weakens Li Ming's rebuttal to Zhang Qiang's argument.

  A: This statement suggests that reemployment will lead to increased consumption of goods that were previously delayed, which could weaken Li Ming's argument that unemployed people cannot increase consumption.
  B: This statement is about consumer beliefs, not about the actual impact of low prices on consumption and economic conditions.
  C: This statement supports Li Ming's argument that unemployed people will only buy necessities, so it does not weaken his rebuttal.
  D: This statement suggests that even unemployed people will have savings for consumption when prices fall to the lowest point, which could weaken Li Ming's argument that they cannot increase consumption.

Criticism:
  A and D both provide reasons for why unemployed people might be able to increase consumption when prices fall, which weakens Li Ming's rebuttal. Between the two, A focuses on the impact of reemployment and delayed purchases, while D focuses on the savings of unemployed people during economic deterioration. D seems to be more directly related to the situation of unemployed people during the period of economic deterioration, so it might be a stronger choice to weaken Li Ming's rebuttal.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.

A: Quinn was recruited third.
- This is possible since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and it doesn't conflict with any other information.

B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
- This is possible since it doesn't conflict with any other information.

C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
- This is not possible since Stanton cannot be recruited immediately before or after Tao, who was recruited second.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Eight compositions: F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T
- Conditions:
  1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  3. O is performed either first or fifth.
  4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  5. P is performed at some time before S.
  6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.

Thought:
- Given: S is performed fourth.
- Condition 5: P must be performed before S, so P must be in one of the first three positions.
- Condition 3: O is performed either first or fifth. Since S is performed fourth, O cannot be performed fifth, so O must be performed first.
- Condition 6: At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Since O is performed first and S is performed fourth, there must be at least one composition between O and S.
- Condition 1: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. Since O is performed first, T cannot be performed immediately before F in the first three positions. Therefore, T must be performed immediately after R in the first three positions.

Now, let's analyze each choice:

A: F, H, P
- O is not performed first, which violates Condition 3.

B: H, P, L
- O is not performed first, which violates Condition 3.

C: O, P, R
- O is performed first, satisfying Condition 3.
- P is performed before S, satisfying Condition 5.
- T must be performed immediately after R, so T will be performed fourth, which violates the given condition that S is performed fourth.

D: O, P, T
- O is performed first, satisfying Condition 3.
- P is performed before S, satisfying Condition 5.
- T is performed immediately after R, which is not possible in this sequence.

E: P, R, T
- O is not performed first, which violates Condition 3.

Since choice C is the only one that satisfies most of the conditions, it is the most likely answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Eight compositions: F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T
- Conditions:
  1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  3. O is performed either first or fifth.
  4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  5. P is performed at some time before S.
  6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.

Thought:
- Given: S is performed fourth.
- We need to find the possible compositions for first, second, and third positions.

A: F, H, P
- If F is first, T must be immediately before F, which is not possible. So, A is not a valid option.

B: H, P, L
- If H is first, it cannot be the eighth composition as per condition 4. So, B is not a valid option.

C: O, P, R
- If O is first, it satisfies condition 3.
- P is before S (which is fourth), satisfying condition 5.
- R is third, and T can be performed immediately after R, satisfying condition 1.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall

- More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Thought:
- If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 3.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3, and Udall works in Zone 2.
- Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, Quinn will work in Zone 1 if Parra works in Zone 1, and Quinn will work in Zone 3 if Parra works in Zone 3.
- Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, Stuckey will work in Zone 3 if Udall works in Zone 3, and Stuckey will work in Zone 2 if Udall works in Zone 2.

- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, which could be Zone 2 or Zone 3.
- If Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey also works in Zone 2, and Quinn cannot work in Zone 2 because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- Therefore, if Tiao works in Zone 1, Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3.

Criticism:
- The thought process is correct and covers all possible scenarios.

- Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, as Stuckey works in the same zone as Udall, and if Quinn were to work in that zone, there would not be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
- More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Thought:
- If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 3.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3, and Udall works in Zone 2.
- Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, Quinn will work in Zone 1 if Parra works in Zone 1, and Quinn will work in Zone 3 if Parra works in Zone 3.
- Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, Stuckey will work in Zone 3 if Udall works in Zone 3, and Stuckey will work in Zone 2 if Udall works in Zone 2.

Criticism:
- The thought process is correct and covers all possible scenarios.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
- More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Thought:
- If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in the same zone as Stuckey.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in the same zone as Quinn, and Udall works in Zone 2 with Stuckey.
- Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, if Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn also works in Zone 1.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, which could be Zone 2 or Zone 3.
- If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, and Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey also works in Zone 2.

Criticism:
- The thought process is correct, but it needs to be more concise and focused on finding the sales representative that Quinn cannot work with.

Thought (revised):
- If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in the same zone as Stuckey.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in the same zone as Quinn, and Udall works in Zone 2 with Stuckey.
- Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, if Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn also works in Zone 1.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, which could be Zone 2 or Zone 3.
- If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, and Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey also works in Zone 2.
- Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, as they would both be in Zone 2, which contradicts the condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil

Knowledge:
- Each student has 2 paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
- Two paintings per wall, one upper and one lower.
- No wall has only watercolors.
- No wall has the work of only one student.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
- Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
- Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.

Thought:
- Isaacs's oil is on wall 4, so the upper position of wall 4 must be a watercolor by either Franz, Greene, or Hidalgo.
- Since no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs, the upper position of wall 4 cannot be Franz's watercolor.
- Isaacs's watercolor is on wall 2, so the other painting on wall 2 must be an oil painting by either Franz, Greene, or Hidalgo.
- Since Franz's oil is on wall 3, the other painting on wall 2 must be either Greene's oil or Hidalgo's oil.
- Franz's oil is on wall 3, and Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. So, Greene's watercolor is in the upper position of wall 3.
- Since no wall has the work of only one student, the other painting on wall 3 must be by Hidalgo or Isaacs.
- Since no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs, the other painting on wall 3 must be Hidalgo's oil.
- Therefore, the paintings on wall 1 must be by Franz and Greene.
- Since Greene's watercolor is on wall 3, Greene's oil must be on wall 1.
- Therefore, the answer is B: Greene's oil.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr

- Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is also in Zone 1.
- Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, if Udall is in Zone 2, then Stuckey is also in Zone 2.
- If Parra is in Zone 1 and Tiao is in Zone 2, then Kim and Mahr must be in Zone 3.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The argument states that Harrold Foods dominates the soft-drink market with its product "Hero."
- The argument uses survey results showing that 72 percent of consumers believe "Hero" dominates the market.
- The argument defines market dominance as having more than 50 percent of sales in a market.

Thought:
- The argument assumes that because a majority of consumers believe "Hero" dominates the market, it actually does dominate the market.
- The argument does not provide any actual sales data to support the claim of market dominance.

Criticism:
- The argument relies on consumer opinions rather than actual sales data to determine market dominance.
- The argument assumes that consumer opinions are equivalent to actual market conditions.

Analysis of Choices:
A: The argument does not discuss the cause or result of market conditions, so this choice is not relevant.

B: The argument does not confuse necessary and sufficient conditions, so this choice is not relevant.

C: The argument does not treat the failure to establish a claim as equivalent to demonstrating its truth, so this choice is not relevant.

D: This choice accurately describes the error in the argument. The argument takes evidence that a claim is believed to be true (consumer opinions) as evidence that the claim is in fact true (market dominance).

E: The argument does not describe survey results as bound to obtain in the future, so this choice is not relevant.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.

Topic: Law
Context: University president: Research institutions have an obligation to promote research in any field of theoretical investigation if that research shows some promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
Question: The principle stated by the university president, ifvalid, most helps to justitY which one of the following actions?
Choices:
  A: A university denies a grant application from a fucuity member for work on a solurion to a tiunous mathematical puzzle that has no relation to practical concerns.
  B: A government agency funds a research project in astrophysics designed to determine whether there are theoretical limits on the magnitude of planets in distant solar systems.
  C: A university funds a research position in the pbysics department that involves no teaching but has the responsibility for managing all the grant applications by members of the physics fucuity.
  D: A foundation decides not to fund a research proposal in applied mathematics that sought to model certain poorly understood aspects of economic behavior.
  E: A research institute funds an investigation into the mathematical properties offolded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The university president's principle states that research institutions have an obligation to promote research in any field of theoretical investigation if that research shows some promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.

Thought:
- We need to find the action that best aligns with the principle stated by the university president.

Choices analysis:
A: Denying a grant application for work on a solution to a mathematical puzzle that has no relation to practical concerns does not align with the principle, as it does not show promise of yielding insights into practical problems.
B: Funding a research project in astrophysics to determine theoretical limits on the magnitude of planets in distant solar systems may not directly align with the principle, as it is not clear whether this research will yield insights into practical problems affecting people's quality of life.
C: Funding a research position in the physics department for managing grant applications does not directly align with the principle, as it does not involve promoting research that yields insights into practical problems.
D: Deciding not to fund a research proposal in applied mathematics that sought to model poorly understood aspects of economic behavior does not align with the principle, as it seems to have potential to yield insights into practical problems.
E: Funding an investigation into the mathematical properties of folded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease aligns with the principle, as it shows promise of yielding insights into practical problems that affect people's quality of life.

Conclusion:
The action that best aligns with the principle stated by the university president is E: funding an investigation into the mathematical properties of folded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the evidence suggests the local auto repair shop is responsible for the pollution, but the penalty is so severe that stronger evidence or an admission of guilt is needed before imposing the penalty.

Thought:
  We need to find a principle that justifies the reasoning in the argument.

  A: This principle states that the certainty of guilt must be higher when the penalty is more severe. This aligns with the argument's reasoning that stronger evidence or an admission is needed before imposing the severe penalty.
  
  B: This principle discusses the balance between deterrence and willingness to impose penalties. It does not directly address the argument's reasoning about the need for stronger evidence or an admission of guilt.
  
  C: This principle focuses on the proportionality of penalties to harm caused. It does not directly address the argument's reasoning about the need for stronger evidence or an admission of guilt.
  
  D: This principle discusses the likelihood of someone admitting guilt based on the severity of the penalty. It does not directly address the argument's reasoning about the need for stronger evidence or an admission of guilt.
  
  E: This principle states that penalties should not be so severe that guilt can never be sufficiently certain. It does not directly address the argument's reasoning about the need for stronger evidence or an admission of guilt.

Criticism:
  The principles in choices B, C, D, and E do not directly address the argument's reasoning about the need for stronger evidence or an admission of guilt. Choice A is the most relevant principle, as it states that the certainty of guilt must be higher when the penalty is more severe, which aligns with the argument's reasoning.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:

- The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
- The study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.

Thought:
- We need to find an option that weakens the reasoning above.

A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
- This option suggests that overestimating dangers is not necessarily related to the amount of television watched, which weakens the argument.

B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
- This option does not directly address the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks.

C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
- This option does not weaken the argument, as it does not address the relationship between watching an above-average amount of television and overestimating risks.

D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
- This option does not weaken the argument, as it does not address the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks.

E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
- This option suggests that people who watch more television may actually be at a higher risk of natural disasters, which could explain their overestimation of risks. This weakens the argument.

Criticism:
- Option A weakens the argument by suggesting that overestimating dangers is not necessarily related to the amount of television watched.
- Option E weakens the argument by suggesting that people who watch more television may actually be at a higher risk of natural disasters, which could explain their overestimation of risks.

- The study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.

Thought:
- We need to find an option that weakens the reasoning above, which means we need to find an alternative explanation or a flaw in the reasoning.

A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
- This option suggests that overestimating dangers is not necessarily related to the amount of television watched, which weakens the argument.

B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
- This option suggests that there might be a correlation between watching more television and living in safer areas, but it does not directly weaken the argument.

C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
- This option supports the argument, as it suggests that watching less television leads to a more accurate perception of risks.

D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
- This option does not directly weaken the argument, as it does not provide an alternative explanation for the overestimation of risks.

E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
- This option suggests that there might be a correlation between living in disaster-prone areas and watching more television, but it does not directly weaken the argument.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychologist: The obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously. However much society may have changed over the centuries, human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction. Thus, the important social function of positively reinforcing those behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others can be served only if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the psychologist's argument by the claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously?
Choices:
  A: It is an illustration of a premise that is used to support the argument's conclusion.
  B: It is used to counter a consideration that might be taken to undermine the argument's conclusion.
  C: It is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
  D: It is used to identify the social benefit with which the argument is concerned.
  E: It is the conclusion that the argument is intended to support.

  A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills to build a dam.
  A legislator has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.
  The columnist believes the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.

Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.
  E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.

Thought:
  The columnist's judgment is that the legislator's proposal to use the additional charge on water bills for building new roads instead of a dam is unacceptable.
  The principle that most helps to justify the columnist's judgment would be one that supports the idea that the additional charge should be used for its original purpose (water-related expenditures) and not for unrelated projects (building new roads).

Criticism:
  Choice A is relevant but does not directly address the issue of using the additional charge for its intended purpose.
  Choice B is a general principle but does not specifically address the issue of using the additional charge for water-related expenditures.
  Choice C is relevant but focuses on customer approval rather than the intended use of the additional charge.
  Choice D is not relevant to the issue of using the additional charge for its intended purpose, as it focuses on the approval process.
  Choice E directly addresses the issue of using the additional charge for water-related expenditures and supports the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the results of an experiment.
  A: The placebo effect is a phenomenon in which a patient's belief in the effectiveness of a treatment can lead to improvement in their condition.
  B: Physician's beliefs about the effectiveness of medication versus magnets are not directly relevant to the results of the experiment.
  C: The lack of experiments on magnetic fields reducing pain in other areas does not directly counter the physician's argument about back pain.
  D: The beliefs of the scientists who designed the experiment do not necessarily affect the results of the experiment if they were not directly involved in conducting it.
  E: Variation in the causes of chronic back pain among patients could potentially affect the generalizability of the experiment's results.

Thought:
  The physician's argument is based on the results of an experiment.
  The logically strongest counter to the argument would be a factor that could undermine the validity of the experiment's results.
  A: The placebo effect could potentially explain the difference in pain relief between the two groups, undermining the conclusion that magnetic fields are effective.
  B: Physician's beliefs about medication versus magnets do not directly counter the results of the experiment.
  C: The lack of experiments on other areas of pain does not directly counter the argument about back pain.
  D: The beliefs of the scientists who designed the experiment do not necessarily affect the results if they were not directly involved in conducting it.
  E: Variation in the causes of chronic back pain could affect the generalizability of the results, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument.

Criticism:
  The thought process is logical and considers the relevance of each choice to the physician's argument.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Commensals are bacteria that benefit human beings when they are present in the body.
- Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers.
- Some scientists consider H pylori a commensal because it allegedly strengthens immune response.
- Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis.
- The argument states that calling H pylori a commensal is misguided because only about 10 percent of people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.

Thought:
- The argument is comparing H pylori and M tuberculosis to make a point about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal.
- To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that weakens the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis or shows that the comparison is not relevant.

Choices analysis:
A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
- This statement shows a similarity between the two bacteria, but it does not address the main point of the argument, which is whether H pylori should be considered a commensal.

B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
- This statement highlights a difference between the two bacteria, but it does not address the main point of the argument, which is whether H pylori should be considered a commensal.

C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
- This statement directly addresses the main point of the argument by showing a key difference between H pylori and M tuberculosis. If people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, then the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is weakened, undermining the argument's reasoning.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Primary substances in plants are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
- Secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.

Thought:
- The question asks for an analogy that reflects the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants.
- Primary substances are essential for the functioning of plants, while secondary substances provide distinctive characteristics but are not essential for growth or metabolism.

Choices analysis:
A: Electrical power is essential for the functioning of hospitals, and generators provide backup power. However, this analogy does not include a secondary component that provides distinctive characteristics without being essential for functioning.
B: Mechanical components are necessary for automobiles to run, while paint and taillights provide distinctive looks and serve functions but are not essential for the car to run. This analogy reflects the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants.
C: Mechanical components are required for the operation of clothing factories, and electrical components supply the power needed to run the mechanical components. However, this analogy does not include a secondary component that provides distinctive characteristics without being essential for functioning.
D: Braking systems are necessary for trains to decelerate and stop, and they comprise both friction and pneumatic components. However, this analogy does not include a secondary component that provides distinctive characteristics without being essential for functioning.
E: Word processing programs are necessary for computers to function as word processors, and they can be stored in internal memory or external disks. However, this analogy does not include a secondary component that provides distinctive characteristics without being essential for functioning.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.
  D: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
  E: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.
Question: Which choice best describes the ways that the two authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society?
Choices:
  A: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.
  B: Tocqueville believes that an individual's economic class should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that class is not a legitimate consideration.
  C: Tocqueville believes that an individual's temperament should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that temperament should not be a factor in an individual's position.
  D: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by what is most beneficial to society, while Mill believes it should be determined by what an individual finds most rewarding. 41

  Passage 1 is written by Alexis de Tocqueville, who discusses the idea of democratic equality between the sexes. He argues that the differences between men and women are natural and that their roles in society should be distinct and complementary. He believes that the improvement of society comes from each sex fulfilling their respective tasks in the best possible manner.

  Passage 2 is written by John Stuart Mill, who argues for complete liberty of choice for individuals to determine their proper position in society. He believes that every occupation should be open to all, without favor or discouragement, and that individuals should be able to prove their capacities through trial. He argues that arbitrary limits based on sex or class are unjust and detrimental to society.

Thought:
  Comparing the two authors' views on the individual's proper position in society, we can see that Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.

  Therefore, the choice that best describes the ways that the two authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society is A: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.

Criticism:
  The analysis of the passages and the comparison of the authors' views seem accurate and well-reasoned. The chosen answer aligns with the information provided in the passages.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: Based on the passage, the researchers’ conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported in part by the fact that
Choices:
  A: no genetic variations were common to all those finches that were not also common to all the finches that did not use that technique.
  B: those finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
  C: the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
  D: there is probably not a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of that technique and its prior transmission to those finches.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Large competitors are often viewed as a major.threat for startups and small companies; big.companies have more financial resources and greater.scale, market power and brand awareness than.smaller ones. However, our research finds that a.smaller brand can actually benefit if consumers can.see the competitive threat it faces from a larger.organization..When a U.S.-based ice cream chain with about 1,400 stores moved within 50 steps of a J.P. Licks ice.cream store in Newton, Massachusetts, some people.expected that J.P. Licks, a small, locally owned.company, would be beaten out of the Newton market..But consumers rallied around J.P. Licks, and the.national chain later closed its nearby location. When.the owner of the Los Angeles-based coffee store chain.The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf could not stop a large.coffee shop chain from moving in next door, he was.surprised to see his sales shoot up—so much so that.he started proactively colocating new stores next to.large chain ones..These examples are not anomalies. In six lab and.field studies, we explored the effects of having a large,.dominant competitor and found that highlighting a.large competitor’s size and close proximity can help.smaller brands, instead of harming them. Compared.to when they are in competition with brands that are.similar to them in size or when consumers view them.outside of a competitive context, small brands see.consumer support go up when they are faced with a.competitive threat from large brands. This support.translates into higher purchase intention, more.purchases and more favorable online reviews..As part of our research, we conducted a field study.at an independent bookstore in Cambridge,.Massachusetts. Upon entering the bookstore, 163.prospective shoppers were exposed to one of three.versions of an in-store ad, emphasizing either the.store’s large competitors, small competitors or no.competition. Shoppers who read the “large.competitors” version were told that the store’s main.competitors are large corporations that have the.ability to put small businesses such as this bookstore.out of business. The “small competitors” version.indicated the store’s main competitors are other.locally owned small bookstores in Cambridge. In the.“no competition” version, participants were given no.information about the competitive environment..Shoppers were then given a $5 coupon, coded with.the in-store ad version they read. Analyzing.shoppers’ sales receipts and the number of redeemed.coupons, we found that shoppers were significantly.more likely to make a purchase after reading the.“large competitors” version of the in-store ad,.compared to the “small competitors” version or the.“no competition” version. They also purchased more.items and spent more money at the store, compared.to shoppers reading the “small competitors” or “no.competition” versions. These results suggest that.framing the competitive game and emphasizing a.competitive narrative against a larger company can.help a small establishment—and spur consumers to.make a purchase that supports the smaller.competitor..In subsequent studies, we tested this “framing-.the-game” effect in various contexts and product.categories and further found that support for a large.brand decreases when consumers view it as being in.competition with a smaller brand. In one study, we.asked participants to assess two hypothetical rival tire.shops, “Tire World” and “Tire Planet,” under three.conditions—small vs. large, small vs. small or large.vs. large competitors. While participants indicated no.preference for the small or large shop when it was.competing against a competitor of similar size, the.small vs. large competitive context elicited a strong.preference for the small rather than large shop.
Question: The studies in the passage suggest that if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, a likely result is that the large store would
Choices:
  A: receive more positive reviews from its customers.
  B: gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops.
  C: benefit from people's perception that its competition is now even greater.
  D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.

Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."
Question: What can reasonably be inferred about the reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study?

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The Downtown Business Association (DBA) in a certain city plans to increase its membership by a total of $n$ businesses per year. There were $b$ businesses in the DBA at the beginning of this year. Which function best models the total number of businesses, $y$, the DBA plans to have as members $x$ years from now?
Choices:
  A: $y=n x+b$
  B: $y=n x-b$
  C: $y=b(n)^{x}$
  D: $y=n(b)^{x}$
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The question is asking for a function that models the total number of businesses in the DBA after x years.
  The DBA plans to increase its membership by n businesses per year.
  There were b businesses in the DBA at the beginning of this year.

Thought:
  We need to find a function that represents the total number of businesses after x years.
  Since the DBA plans to increase its membership by n businesses per year, we can represent the increase in businesses as n * x.
  The initial number of businesses is b, so we need to add the increase in businesses to the initial number of businesses.

Criticism:
  The thought process is correct, and we can now evaluate each option based on the thought process.

Options:
  A: $y=n x+b$ - This function represents the initial number of businesses (b) plus the increase in businesses (n * x) after x years. This is a linear function and seems to fit the problem description.
  B: $y=n x-b$ - This function represents the increase in businesses (n * x) minus the initial number of businesses (b). This does not fit the problem description, as we need to add the increase in businesses to the initial number of businesses.
  C: $y=b(n)^{x}$ - This function represents an exponential growth, where the initial number of businesses (b) is multiplied by the growth factor (n) raised to the power of x. This does not fit the problem description, as the DBA plans to increase its membership by a constant number of businesses per year, not by a percentage.
  D: $y=n(b)^{x}$ - This function also represents an exponential growth, where the growth factor (b) is raised to the power of x and then multiplied by n. This does not fit the problem description for the same reason as option C.

  The initial number of businesses is b, so we need to add the increase in businesses to the initial number of businesses.

Criticism:
  The thought process is correct, and we can now evaluate the given options.

Options:
  A: $y=n x+b$ - This function represents the initial number of businesses (b) plus the increase in businesses (n * x) after x years. This seems to be the correct function.
  B: $y=n x-b$ - This function represents the increase in businesses (n * x) minus the initial number of businesses (b). This is not correct, as we need to add the increase in businesses to the initial number of businesses.
  C: $y=b(n)^{x}$ - This function represents an exponential growth, which is not the case here, as the DBA plans to increase its membership by a constant number of businesses per year.
  D: $y=n(b)^{x}$ - This function also represents an exponential growth, which is not the case here, as the DBA plans to increase its membership by a constant number of businesses per year.

Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:

Knowledge:
  The table shows the number of dreams recalled by people in Group X and Group Y.
  Group X has 100 people with early bedtimes.
  Group Y has 100 people with later bedtimes.
  We need to find the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belongs to Group Y.

Thought:
  First, we need to find the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream.
  In Group X, there are 28 people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and 57 people who recalled 5 or more dreams.
  In Group Y, there are 11 people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and 68 people who recalled 5 or more dreams.
  So, the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is (28 + 57) + (11 + 68) = 85 + 79 = 164.

  Next, we need to find the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream.
  In Group Y, there are 11 people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and 68 people who recalled 5 or more dreams.

  The table shows the number of dreams recalled by people in Group X and Group Y.
  Group X has 100 people with early bedtimes.
  Group Y has 100 people with later bedtimes.
  We need to find the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belongs to Group Y.

Thought:
  First, we need to find the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream.
  In Group X, there are 28 people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and 57 people who recalled 5 or more dreams.
  In Group Y, there are 11 people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and 68 people who recalled 5 or more dreams.
  So, the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is (28 + 57) + (11 + 68) = 85 + 79 = 164.

  Next, we need to find the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream.
  In Group Y, there are 11 people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and 68 people who recalled 5 or more dreams.
  So, the total number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is 11 + 68 = 79.

  Now, we can find the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belongs to Group Y.
  Probability = (Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream) / (Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream)
  Probability = 79 / 164

Response 0:
Knowledge:
  To find the equivalent expression, we can use the properties of fractions and algebraic manipulation.

Thought:
  We are given the expression: $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}}$
  First, we find a common denominator for the two fractions in the denominator:
  The common denominator is (x+2)(x+3).

  Now, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
  $\frac{1}{\frac{x+3}{(x+2)(x+3)}+\frac{x+2}{(x+2)(x+3)}}$

  Combine the fractions in the denominator:
  $\frac{1}{\frac{(x+3)+(x+2)}{(x+2)(x+3)}}$

  Simplify the numerator of the denominator:
  $\frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{(x+2)(x+3)}}$

  Now, we can use the property of fractions that $\frac{a}{\frac{b}{c}} = \frac{a}{1} \cdot \frac{c}{b} = \frac{ac}{b}$:
  $\frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{(x+2)(x+3)}} = \frac{1 \cdot (x+2)(x+3)}{2x+5}$

  Simplify the expression:
  $\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{2x+5}$

  Expand the numerator:
  $\frac{x^2+5x+6}{2x+5}$

  The equivalent expression is $\frac{x^2+5x+6}{2x+5}$.

  The number of protons determines the element's atomic number.
  Electrons have a negligible mass compared to protons and neutrons.

Thought:
  The atom has 20 protons and 21 neutrons.
  To find the atomic mass, we need to add the number of protons and neutrons.
  Atomic mass = number of protons + number of neutrons
  Atomic mass = 20 protons + 21 neutrons
  Atomic mass = 41

Criticism:
  The facts, logic, and reasoning are correct.
  The atomic mass is the sum of protons and neutrons, and electrons have a negligible mass.

Topic: Family Life
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

Topic: Health
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make a homemade ear cleaner [title] Get a small bottle. [step] You can either get an ear dropper bottle or a small (1 oz) brown bottle with an eye-dropper cap. [title] Fill the bottle with your chosen oil.
Choices:
  A: [step] Make sure that the bottle is small enough to hold all of the oil you'll be adding to it. [substeps] Oil from your choice of product may not soften your ear canal to the point where it won't fit over a toothbrush.
  B: [step] Use either mineral oil or olive oil. [substeps] Oil-based cleaners have the advantage of lubricating the ear canal.
  C: [step] Add distilled water to make the bottle easier to clean. Test the ear cleaner on a small, hidden area of your ear while it is still in the bottle.
  D: [step] You can use any type of oil, but don't add more than 10 drops if you want to replicate this scent. Keep dilufying the oil between 5-10 drops.

Topic: Gynaecology & Obstetrics
Question: A female come to gynaeoPD for preconceptual counseling, with history of two second trimester aboions. What is the next investigation you will advice
Choices:
  A: TVS
  B: hysteroscopy
  C: Endometrial biopsy
  D: chromosomal abnormalities
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Preconceptual counseling is a consultation with a healthcare professional before attempting to conceive.
  Second trimester abortions refer to pregnancy losses that occur between 13 and 28 weeks of gestation.
  A: TVS (Transvaginal ultrasound) is a type of ultrasound that is used to examine the female reproductive organs, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.
  B: Hysteroscopy is a procedure that allows a doctor to look inside the uterus to diagnose and treat causes of abnormal bleeding.
  C: Endometrial biopsy is a procedure in which a small sample of the endometrium (the lining of the uterus) is removed for examination.
  D: Chromosomal abnormalities are changes in the number or structure of chromosomes, which can lead to genetic disorders or birth defects.

Thought:
  The patient has a history of two second trimester abortions.
  The goal of preconceptual counseling is to identify and address any potential risk factors for future pregnancy complications.
  The next investigation should focus on identifying the cause of the previous second trimester abortions.
  Chromosomal abnormalities can be a cause of recurrent pregnancy loss, especially in the second trimester.

Criticism:
  The thought process is logical and focuses on identifying the cause of the previous second trimester abortions.
  Chromosomal abnormalities are a relevant factor to consider in this case.

 Knowledge:
The semi-perimeter of a room is equal to the sum of the lengths of its sides. The height of a room is equal to the semi-perimeter of the room divided by 2.

The problem states that the height of the room is 2:5 times the semi-perimeter of the room. This means that the height of the room is equal to the semi-perimeter of the room divided by 2.

The problem also states that the width of the paper is 50 cm and the cost of paper is Rs.2 per meter.

Thought:
To find the height of the room, we need to use the information given in the problem to find the semi-perimeter of the room. We can do this by using the formula for the semi-perimeter of a rectangle, which is:

Semi-perimeter = 2(length + width)

We know the length of the room is 20 meters, and the width is 5 meters. So, the semi-perimeter of the room is:

Semi-perimeter = 2(20 + 5) = 40 meters

Now, we know that the height of the room is equal to the semi-perimeter of the room divided by 2. So, we can use the formula:

Height = Semi-perimeter / 2

Substituting the value of the semi-perimeter, we get:

Height = 40 / 2 = 20 meters

Therefore, the height of the room is 20 meters.

* For example, to find the number of coins of 25 paise, we divide the total amount of Rs. 700 by 25 paise, which gives us 453 coins.
* Therefore, the answer is A: 453.

Criticism:

* The answer is incorrect because it does not take into account the number of coins of each denomination.
* To find the number of coins of each denomination, we need to divide the total amount by the denomination value.
* For example, to find the number of coins of 25 paise, we divide the total amount of Rs. 700 by 25 paise, which gives us 453 coins.
* Therefore, the correct answer is B: 651.

Topic: Math
Question: John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made?
Choices:
  A: 1,980
  B: 2,020
  C: 2,100
  D: 2,200
  E: 1,900
Response 0:
 Knowledge:

To create a 3-letter code, we need to choose 5 vowels and 20 consonants. The middle letter must be a vowel, and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonants.

Options:

A: 1,980 - This is the number of codes that can be made if we choose 5 vowels and 20 consonants randomly.

B: 2,020 - This is the number of codes that can be made if we choose 5 vowels and 20 consonants randomly, and the middle letter is a vowel.

C: 2,100 - This is the number of codes that can be made if we choose 5 vowels and 20 consonants randomly, and the first letter and the third letter are different from each other and are both consonants.

D: 2,200 - This is the number of codes that can be made if we choose 5 vowels and 20 consonants randomly, and the middle letter is a vowel, and the first letter and the third letter are different from each other and are both consonants.

E: 1,900 - This is the number of codes that can be made if we choose 5 vowels and 20 consonants randomly, and the middle letter is a vowel, but the first letter and the third letter are the same consonant.

Thought:

To determine the number of codes that can be made, we need to consider the number of ways to choose the vowels and consonants. Since there are 5 vowels to choose from, and we need to choose 1 vowel for the middle letter, there are 5 options for the vowel. For the consonants, there are 20 options to choose from, and we need to choose 2 consonants for the first letter and the third letter.

Using the multiplication principle, we can calculate the number of codes as follows:

5 options for the vowel x 20 options for the consonants = 100 options for the code

Since the middle letter must be a vowel, there are 5 options for the middle letter. Therefore, the total number of codes is:

100 x 5 = 500 codes

C: 2,100 - This is the number of codes that can be made if we choose 5 vowels and 20 consonants randomly, and the first letter and the third letter are different from each other and are both consonants.

D: 2,200 - This is the number of codes that can be made if we choose 5 vowels and 20 consonants randomly, and the middle letter is a vowel, and the first letter and the third letter are different from each other and are both consonants.

E: 1,900 - This is the number of codes that can be made if we choose 5 vowels and 20 consonants randomly, and the middle letter is a vowel, but the first letter and the third letter are the same consonant.

Thought:

To determine the number of codes that can be made, we need to consider the number of ways to choose the vowels and consonants. Since there are 5 vowels to choose from, and we need to choose 1 vowel for the middle letter, there are 5 options for the vowel. For the consonants, there are 20 options to choose from, and we need to choose 2 consonants for the first letter and the third letter.

Using the multiplication principle, we can calculate the number of codes as follows:

5 options for the vowel x 20 options for the consonants = 100 options for the code

Since the middle letter must be a vowel, there are 5 options for the middle letter. Therefore, the total number of codes is:

100 x 5 = 500 codes

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?
Choices:
  A: 300
  B: 500
  C: 5000
  D: 6000

The information given in the question is:

* In 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned.
* In 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year.

From this information, we can calculate the total number of deer in the forest in 2002 as follows:

Total deer in forest in 2002 = Number of deer caught in 2002 - Number of deer with tags from previous year
= 500 - 20
= 480

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 480.

 Knowledge:

* The coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin she brings up from the bottom of the river.
* The coin-diver gets 25 cents for each brass coin she brings up from the bottom of the river.
* If the coin-diver brought $3.40 after one dive, then the total value of the coins she brought is $3.40 / 0.20 = 17 copper coins.

Thought:

Let's assume the minimum number of copper coins the coin-diver brought is x.

We know that the total value of the coins she brought is $3.40, so the number of brass coins she brought is $3.40 / 0.25 = 13 brass coins.

Since the coin-diver got 20 cents for each copper coin she brought, the number of copper coins she brought is x / 0.20 = 17 copper coins.

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins the coin-diver brought is 17.

Option A: 41.86%
This is the percentage increase needed to make the product 100% of its original price. To find this percentage, we can divide the original price by the reduced price: 100% / 30% = 41.86%.

Option B: 42.86%
This is also the percentage increase needed to make the product 100% of its original price.

Option C: 43.86%
This is also the percentage increase needed to make the product 100% of its original price.

Option D: 44.86%
This is not the correct answer. To find the percentage increase needed to make the product 100% of its original price, we need to divide the original price by the reduced price, not the other way around.

Option E: 45.86%
This is also not the correct answer.

Thought:
To find the percentage increase needed to make the product 100% of its original price, we can divide the original price by the reduced price: 100% / 30% = 41.86%. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: 41.86%.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Researchers in a country reported that they found meteorites about 200 million years old in the strata of a certain area, and they were probably traces of flying objects when a huge meteorite hit the present province of Quebec, Canada.The clay layer with a thickness of about 5 cm also contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are 50 to 2000 times the concentration normally found on the ground.In addition, this rock also contains special minerals in the formation of the late Bacques.Since the upper and lower strata also contain marine plankton fossils, it can be determined that the impact period was about 215 million years ago.
Question: Which of the following, if true, would best support the above research findings?
Choices:
  A: The rock was formed after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground
  B: In the late Paleozoic Triassic (approximately 200 million to 237 million years ago) ammonite and other species were extinct on a large scale
  C: Elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface
  D: In ancient times, there have been many incidents of meteorite impacting the earth
Response 0:
  Great, let's evaluate the options:

A: The rock was formed after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground

This option does not support the research findings as the clay layer with a thickness of about 5 cm and the high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum are not consistent with the formation of a rock that was exposed above the ground after accumulating in the deep seabed.

B: In the late Paleozoic Triassic (approximately 200 million to 237 million years ago) ammonite and other species were extinct on a large scale

This option is irrelevant to the research findings as the extinction of ammonite and other species in the late Paleozoic Triassic does not provide any information about the origin of the meteorites found in the strata of the certain area.

C: Elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface

This option is correct. The high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum in the clay layer are consistent with the origin of the meteorites found in the strata of the certain area. Meteorites are known to contain high concentrations of these elements, and their presence in the clay layer supports the research findings that the meteorites found in the area are likely traces of flying objects from a huge meteorite hit in the present province of Quebec, Canada.

D: In ancient times, there have been many incidents of meteorite impacting the earth

This option is irrelevant to the research findings as the occurrence of meteorite impacts in ancient times does not provide any information about the origin of the meteorites found in the strata of the certain area.

The traditional view of the origin of the Gua names in Zhouyi is that they are fictional or have no meaning.
The Eight Diagrams are named after objects, and the hexagrams represent the principle of things, with their rationality taken as the name of a hexagram.
The Lord is supple, so the hexagram is Kun, and Kun represents suppleness.

Thought:

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: About 12,000 years ago, when the climate warmed, humans began to come to North America.At the same time, large mammals, such as mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers, became extinct from their once widespread North American soil.Therefore, contrary to the myth that humans lived in peace with other creatures in nature, as early as 12,000 years ago, human activities led to the extinction of these animals.
Question: Which of the following statements is the most vulnerable to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: This argument excludes humanity from nature without reflection.
  B: The arrival of humans in North America may also lead to the extinction of animals other than mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers.
  C: The extinction of large mammals such as mastodons, mammoths and saber-toothed tigers was of extraordinary significance to the primitive people of early North America.
  D: The evidence presented is equally applicable to two alternative hypotheses? climate change has led to the extinction of large mammals, and the same reasons have led humans to travel across North America.
Response 0:
  The most vulnerable statement to the argument is:

D: The evidence presented is equally applicable to two alternative hypotheses? climate change has led to the extinction of large mammals, and the same reasons have led humans to travel across North America.

The argument suggests that human activities led to the extinction of large mammals in North America, and therefore, statement D is incorrect. The argument does not provide evidence to support the idea that climate change led to the extinction of these animals, and therefore, it cannot be applied to two alternative hypotheses.

The other options are not vulnerable to the argument:

A: This argument excludes humanity from nature without reflection. - This statement is not relevant to the argument as it simply states that humans are a part of nature, which is not in question.

B: The arrival of humans in North America may also lead to the extinction of animals other than mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers. - This statement is not vulnerable to the argument as it simply acknowledges that the arrival of humans may lead to the extinction of other animals, which is not in conflict with the argument.

C: The extinction of large mammals such as mastodons, mammoths and saber-toothed tigers was of extraordinary significance to the primitive people of early North America. - This statement is not vulnerable to the argument as it simply states that the extinction of these animals was significant to early North American primitive people, which is not in conflict with the argument.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Professors? The United States, Canada and other countries have long enrolled masters and doctoral students in writing, and we are still calling for the right to award degrees in writing.This is a very different attitude towards applied and technical disciplines.Are we wrong, or are we wrong?
Question: Which of the following questions is most important to assess the rationality of the above argument?
Choices:
  A: If we are allowed to recruit masters and doctors in writing, how many people will apply for this major?
  B: Do we have the qualifications for the faculty and subject research in writing to recruit masters and doctors?
  C: Have we applied for masters and Ph.Ds in other applied and technical disciplines other than writing?
  D: Should we pay attention to the cultivation of master's degree and doctoral degree in applied and technical disciplines?
Response 0:
 Knowledge:
The argument suggests that there is a discrepancy in the way writing is viewed and treated compared to other applied and technical disciplines, with some arguing that it is wrong to award degrees in writing.

A: If we are allowed to recruit masters and doctors in writing, how many people will apply for this major? - This question is not directly related to the rationality of the argument. The number of people applying for a major is not a determining factor in whether or not a discipline is considered applied or technical.

B: Do we have the qualifications for the faculty and subject research in writing to recruit masters and doctors? - This question is relevant to the argument as it pertains to the qualifications of the faculty and research in the field of writing. If the faculty and research are not up to par, it may be difficult to justify awarding degrees in the field.

C: Have we applied for masters and Ph.Ds in other applied and technical disciplines other than writing? - This question is relevant to the argument as it pertains to the broader context of applied and technical disciplines. If other disciplines are not awarding degrees in writing, it may be reasonable to question whether it is appropriate for writing to be treated differently.

D: Should we pay attention to the cultivation of master's degree and doctoral degree in applied and technical disciplines? - This question is directly related to the argument as it pertains to the importance of cultivating degrees in applied and technical disciplines. If the argument is that writing is not a technical discipline, then it may be reasonable to question the importance of cultivating degrees in the field.

Thought:

If other disciplines are not awarding degrees in writing, it may be reasonable to question whether it is appropriate for writing to be treated differently.

D: Should we pay attention to the cultivation of master's degree and doctoral degree in applied and technical disciplines? - This question is directly related to the argument as it pertains to the importance of cultivating degrees in applied and technical disciplines. If the argument is that writing is not a technical discipline, then it may be reasonable to question the importance of cultivating degrees in the field.

Thought:
The argument suggests that there is a discrepancy in the way writing is viewed and treated compared to other applied and technical disciplines. To assess the rationality of the argument, it is important to evaluate the qualifications of the faculty and research in the field of writing, as well as the broader context of applied and technical disciplines. If the faculty and research are not up to par, or if other disciplines are not awarding degrees in writing, it may be reasonable to question whether it is appropriate for writing to be treated differently.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Zhang Qiang? When the economy in a region is sluggish, many people are unemployed, so they reduce their living expenses, resulting in more unemployment and worsening the economy.The economy continued to deteriorate, and finally prices fell to the lowest point.Low prices have stimulated people to increase their living consumption, and increased consumption has led to improved economic conditions.Li Ming? If people are unemployed, they will not be able to increase their consumption, nor will they have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.Therefore, falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
Question: If the following statement is true, which one can best weaken Li Ming's rebuttal to Zhang Qiang?
Choices:
  A: After the economic situation improves, the company will hire more people, and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed.
  B: Even if the economic situation continues to deteriorate, consumers still believe that the economic situation will eventually improve.
  C: Even when the economy is extremely deteriorating, the unemployed must continue to buy necessities such as food.
  D: During the period of economic deterioration, even unemployed people will compress expenditures; when prices fall to the lowest point, they will have savings for consumption.
Response 0:
  Knowledge:

Zhang Qiang's argument is that when the economy in a region is sluggish, many people reduce their living expenses, resulting in more unemployment and worsening the economy. However, Li Ming argues that if people are unemployed, they will not be able to increase their consumption, nor will they have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.

Thought:

The best answer to weaken Li Ming's rebuttal to Zhang Qiang is option B: Even if the economic situation continues to deteriorate, consumers still believe that the economic situation will eventually improve. This is because Li Ming's argument is based on the assumption that the economy will continue to deteriorate, but if consumers believe that the economy will improve in the future, they may still be willing to spend money, even if they are unemployed.

Option A is not the best answer because it assumes that the company will hire more people, which may not necessarily happen. Option D is also not the best answer because it assumes that unemployed people will have savings for consumption, which may not be the case. Option C is also not the best answer because it assumes that unemployed people will continue to buy necessities, which may not be true if the economy is extremely deteriorating.

Topic: Logic
Context: There is a psychological theory that to be happy, one must maintain an intimate relationship with another.However, the greatest philosophers in the world spent most of their lives in isolation, and had no intimate relationships.Therefore, this psychological theory must be wrong.
Question: Which of the following must be assumed in the above conclusion?
Choices:
  A: The greatest philosophers in the world prefer to avoid intimate relationships.
  B: People with intimate relationships rarely spend their time alone.
  C: Loneliness is necessary for philosophers to meditate.
  D: The greatest philosophers in the world are happy.
Response 0:
  Knowledge:
The psychological theory suggests that maintaining an intimate relationship is necessary for happiness. However, many of the greatest philosophers in history, such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, spent most of their lives in isolation and had no intimate relationships.

Thought:
The conclusion that the psychological theory must be wrong is based on the observation that many of the greatest philosophers in history did not have intimate relationships. This suggests that intimate relationships are not necessary for happiness, as the greatest philosophers in history were able to achieve happiness despite their lack of intimate relationships.

Criticism:
The conclusion may be flawed because it makes an assumption about the preferences of the greatest philosophers in history. It is possible that these philosophers preferred to spend their time alone in order to focus on their philosophical pursuits, rather than because they avoided intimate relationships.

Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.

1. Tao was recruited second, which means that the first person recruited was Peters.
2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, which means that Stanton was recruited after Tao.
3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, which means that Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
4. Villas was recruited immediately before White, which means that Villas was recruited fourth.
5. Peters was recruited fourth, which means that the person recruited third was either Quinn or Rovero.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A) Quinn was recruited third.
This option is incorrect because we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, which means that Rovero was recruited third.

B) Rovero was recruited fifth.
This option is also incorrect because we know that Rovero was recruited third.

C) Stanton was recruited sixth.
This option is incorrect because we know that Stanton was recruited after Tao, and Tao was recruited second.

D) Villas was recruited sixth.
This option is incorrect because we know that Villas was recruited immediately before White, which means that Villas was recruited fifth.

E) White was recruited third.
This option is incorrect because we know that Peters was recruited fourth, and White was recruited last.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
  Great, let's apply the conditions of the problem to determine the answer:

1. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
2. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
3. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
4. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.

Using these conditions, we can deduce the following:

* Wall 1 must have a painting by either Greene or Hidalgo.
* Wall 2 must have a painting by Isaacs.
* Wall 3 must have a painting by Franz.
* Wall 4 must have a painting by either Hidalgo or Isaacs.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A) Franz's watercolor: This cannot be displayed on wall 1 because wall 3 already has a painting by Franz (an oil).
B) Greene's oil: This cannot be displayed on wall 1 because Greene's watercolor is already displayed on wall 2.
C) Greene's watercolor: This cannot be displayed on wall 1 because Greene's oil is already displayed on wall 2.
D) Hidalgo's oil: This cannot be displayed on wall 1 because Hidalgo's watercolor is already displayed on wall 4.
E) Hidalgo's watercolor: This cannot be displayed on wall 1 because Hidalgo's oil is already displayed on wall 4.

Therefore, the answer is:

B: Greene's oil

So, if Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.

  Great, let's analyze the problem:

We have six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. We need to assign them parking spaces numbered #1 to #6. The rules are:

1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

* C: G, H, K (three books)
* D: F, G, M, O (four books)

Criticism:

* Option A has only two books, which is not possible given the information provided.
* Option B has three books, but K is placed on a higher shelf than F, which means K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
* Option C has three books, but G is not placed on the bottom shelf.
* Option D has four books, but O is placed on a higher shelf than L, which means O cannot be on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("D")

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
  The argument commits the error of:

B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result

Explanation:

The argument states that since 72% of consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market, Harrold Foods must already dominate the market. However, this conclusion is based on a faulty assumption that simply having more than 50% of the sales in a market is sufficient to establish dominance. In reality, there may be other factors that contribute to a product's dominance in the market, such as its quality, brand recognition, and marketing strategy. Therefore, the argument mistakes the condition of having a certain percentage of sales as being sufficient to guarantee dominance, when in fact it is just one of many factors that can contribute to dominance.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Response 0:
  Great, let's analyze the options:

A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
This option suggests that the sample of people surveyed immediately after the debate may not be representative of the larger electorate. However, it does not directly undermine the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. The bias could still exist even if a majority of voters did not watch the debate. (Reasoning: Bias can occur when people are influenced by factors other than the actual arguments made during the debate, such as their pre-existing opinions or biases.)

B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
This option suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been influenced by their perception of Tanner's performance in the debate, rather than the actual quality of Lopez's arguments. If the live audience members thought that Tanner was more persuasive, it could be that they were more likely to give Tanner credit for making better arguments, even if Lopez actually made better arguments. (Reasoning: People's perceptions of a debate can be influenced by various factors, including the performative aspects of the debate, rather than just the substance of the arguments.)

C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
This option suggests that the sample of survey respondents who watched the debate may not be representative of the larger electorate, which could lead to biased results. If the people who watched the debate were more likely to vote for Tanner, it could be that they were influenced by factors other than the quality of the arguments made during the debate. (Reasoning: If the sample of survey respondents is not representative of the larger electorate, then the results of the survey may not accurately reflect the opinions of the larger population.)

D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
This option is similar to option C, and suggests that the sample of survey respondents may not be representative of the larger electorate. However, it does not directly undermine the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. (Reasoning: As with option C, if the sample of survey respondents is not representative of the larger electorate, then the results of the survey may not accurately reflect the opinions of the larger population.)

E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
This option does not directly undermine the argument, as it simply provides additional information about the outcome of the election. However, it could be relevant to the analysis of the bias in the survey respondents' opinions, as it suggests that the margin of victory may have been small enough to suggest that the bias of the survey respondents could have influenced the results. (Reasoning: A narrow margin of victory could suggest that the opinions of the survey respondents were more influenced by their biases than by the quality of the arguments made during the debate.)

Therefore, the most serious undermining of the argument is option B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. This option suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been influenced by their perception of Tanner's performance in the debate, rather than the actual quality of Lopez's arguments.

(Reasoning: Bias can occur when people are influenced by factors other than the actual arguments made during the debate, such as their pre-existing opinions or biases.)

B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
This option suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been influenced by their perception of Tanner's performance in the debate, rather than the actual quality of Lopez's arguments. If the live audience members thought that Tanner was more persuasive, it could be that they were more likely to give Tanner credit for making better arguments, even if Lopez actually made better arguments. (Reasoning: People's perceptions of a debate can be influenced by various factors, including the performative aspects of the debate, rather than just the substance of the arguments.)

C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
This option suggests that the sample of survey respondents who watched the debate may not be representative of the larger electorate, which could lead to biased results. If the people who watched the debate were more likely to vote for Tanner, it could be that they were influenced by factors other than the quality of the arguments made during the debate. (Reasoning: If the sample of survey respondents is not representative of the larger electorate, then the results of the survey may not accurately reflect the opinions of the larger population.)

D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
This option is similar to option C, and suggests that the sample of survey respondents may not be representative of the larger electorate. However, it does not directly undermine the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. (Reasoning: As with option C, if the sample of survey respondents is not representative of the larger electorate, then the results of the survey may not accurately reflect the opinions of the larger population.)

E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
This option does not directly undermine the argument, as it simply provides additional information about the outcome of the election. However, it could be relevant to the analysis of the bias in the survey respondents' opinions, as it suggests that the margin of victory may have been small enough to suggest that the bias of the survey respondents could have influenced the results. (Reasoning: A narrow margin of victory could suggest that the opinions of the survey respondents were more influenced by their biases than by the quality of the arguments made during the debate.)

Therefore, the most serious undermining of the argument is option B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. This option suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been influenced by their perception of Tanner's performance in the debate, rather than the actual quality of Lopez's arguments.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: University president: Research institutions have an obligation to promote research in any field of theoretical investigation if that research shows some promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
Question: The principle stated by the university president, ifvalid, most helps to justitY which one of the following actions?
Choices:
  A: A university denies a grant application from a fucuity member for work on a solurion to a tiunous mathematical puzzle that has no relation to practical concerns.
  B: A government agency funds a research project in astrophysics designed to determine whether there are theoretical limits on the magnitude of planets in distant solar systems.
  C: A university funds a research position in the pbysics department that involves no teaching but has the responsibility for managing all the grant applications by members of the physics fucuity.
  D: A foundation decides not to fund a research proposal in applied mathematics that sought to model certain poorly understood aspects of economic behavior.
  E: A research institute funds an investigation into the mathematical properties offolded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease.
Response 0:
  Knowledge:
The principle stated by the university president suggests that research institutions have an obligation to promote research in any field that shows promise of yielding insights into practical problems that affect people's quality of life.

Thought:
Based on the principle, the action that most helps justice is E: A research institute funds an investigation into the mathematical properties of folded structures, as it has the potential to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease. This is a practical problem that affects people's quality of life, and the research has the potential to yield valuable insights.

Criticism:
The other options do not align with the principle stated by the university president:

A: A university denying a grant application from a faculty member for work on a solution to a trivial mathematical puzzle that has no relation to practical concerns does not promote research in a field that shows promise of yielding insights into practical problems.

B: A government agency funding a research project in astrophysics designed to determine whether there are theoretical limits on the magnitude of planets in distant solar systems may be interesting from a theoretical perspective, but it does not directly address practical problems that affect people's quality of life.

C: A university funding a research position in the physics department that involves no teaching but has the responsibility for managing all the grant applications by members of the physics faculty may be efficient in terms of resource allocation, but it does not promote research in a field that shows promise of yielding insights into practical problems.

D: A foundation deciding not to fund a research proposal in applied mathematics that sought to model certain poorly understood aspects of economic behavior may be a valid decision based on the foundation's priorities, but it does not promote research in a field that shows promise of yielding insights into practical problems that affect people's quality of life.

Based on the principle, the action that most helps justice is E: A research institute funds an investigation into the mathematical properties of folded structures, as it has the potential to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease. This is a practical problem that affects people's quality of life, and the research has the potential to yield valuable insights.

Criticism:
The other options do not align with the principle stated by the university president:

A: A university denying a grant application from a faculty member for work on a solution to a trivial mathematical puzzle that has no relation to practical concerns does not promote research in a field that shows promise of yielding insights into practical problems.

B: A government agency funding a research project in astrophysics designed to determine whether there are theoretical limits on the magnitude of planets in distant solar systems may be interesting from a theoretical perspective, but it does not directly address practical problems that affect people's quality of life.

C: A university funding a research position in the physics department that involves no teaching but has the responsibility for managing all the grant applications by members of the physics faculty may be efficient in terms of resource allocation, but it does not promote research in a field that shows promise of yielding insights into practical problems.

D: A foundation deciding not to fund a research proposal in applied mathematics that sought to model certain poorly understood aspects of economic behavior may be a valid decision based on the foundation's priorities, but it does not promote research in a field that shows promise of yielding insights into practical problems that affect people's quality of life.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
  The correct answer is (C): The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.

The argument states that the penalty for pollution is so severe that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, the identity of the polluter cannot be sufficiently certain to justify imposing the penalty. This suggests that the severity of the penalty is proportional to the harm caused by the pollution. If the penalty were not proportional to the harm caused, it would be unjust to impose it on the party responsible.

Option (C) is the best answer because it most closely aligns with the reasoning in the argument. Options (A) and (D) are not supported by the argument, as they do not address the proportionality of the penalty to the harm caused. Option (B) is also not supported, as it suggests that the penalty should be severe enough to deter people from committing the offense, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose it. This is not the same as saying that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused. Option (E) is not a valid principle, as it suggests that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for the offense.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
  The correct answer is (C): People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.

The reasoning above suggests that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. However, if people who watch a below-average amount of television have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster, then this suggests that there may be other factors at play beyond the amount of television watched. It could be that people who are more aware of the risks posed by natural disasters, through other means such as education or personal experience, are less likely to overestimate those risks.

Option (A) is incorrect because while it is true that many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, this does not necessarily weaken the reasoning above. People who watch a below-average amount of television may still overestimate the risks, even if many people do.

Option (B) is also incorrect because it suggests that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, which is not necessarily true. People who watch more television may simply be more aware of the risks posed by natural disasters, regardless of where they live.

Option (D) is incorrect because while it is true that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, this does not necessarily weaken the reasoning above. People who watch a below-average amount of television may still be well informed about the risks, through other means such as education or personal experience.

Option (E) is incorrect because while it is true that a person's location can affect their likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster, this is not necessarily related to the amount of television they watch. People who live in areas prone to natural disasters may still overestimate the risks, regardless of how much television they watch.

Option (A) is incorrect because while it is true that many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, this does not necessarily weaken the reasoning above. People who watch a below-average amount of television may still overestimate the risks, even if many people do.

Option (B) is also incorrect because it suggests that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, which is not necessarily true. People who watch more television may simply be more aware of the risks posed by natural disasters, regardless of where they live.

Option (D) is incorrect because while it is true that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, this does not necessarily weaken the reasoning above. People who watch a below-average amount of television may still be well informed about the risks, through other means such as education or personal experience.

Option (E) is incorrect because while it is true that a person's location can affect their likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster, this is not necessarily related to the amount of television they watch. People who live in areas prone to natural disasters may still overestimate the risks, regardless of how much television they watch.
Response 4:

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychologist: The obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously. However much society may have changed over the centuries, human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction. Thus, the important social function of positively reinforcing those behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others can be served only if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the psychologist's argument by the claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously?
Choices:
  A: It is an illustration of a premise that is used to support the argument's conclusion.
  B: It is used to counter a consideration that might be taken to undermine the argument's conclusion.
  C: It is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
  D: It is used to identify the social benefit with which the argument is concerned.
  E: It is the conclusion that the argument is intended to support.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.That proposal is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable?
Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.
  E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
Response 0:
  Knowledge:
The columnist is arguing that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable because it goes against the principle of transparency and accountability in the use of public funds.

Choices:

A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.

This principle is relevant to the situation because the additional charge on water bills is being imposed on customers without their knowledge or consent. If the money is not being used for water-related expenditures, as the columnist argues, then it is unfair to the customers who are being charged the additional fee.

B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.

This principle is also relevant to the situation because the proposed dam would primarily benefit a specific community or region, rather than the entire community. If the additional revenue from water bills is being used for a project that only benefits a select group of people, then it is not being used in a fair and equitable manner.

C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.

This principle is relevant to the situation because the columnist is arguing that the additional charge on water bills is being imposed without the consent or approval of the majority of the utility's customers. If the customers do not approve of the project, then it is unfair to use their money to fund it.

D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.

This principle is not relevant to the situation because the columnist is arguing that the additional charge on water bills is being imposed without the necessary approval or oversight from the legislature. While it is true that the legislature should have a say in the use of public funds, the principle of transparency and accountability is also important in ensuring that public funds are being used fairly and equitably.

E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.

This principle is relevant to the situation because the columnist is arguing that the additional charge on water bills is not being used for water-related expenditures, but rather for a project that benefits only a select group of people.

This principle is relevant to the situation because the columnist is arguing that the additional charge on water bills is not being used for water-related expenditures, but rather for a project that benefits only a select group of people. If the money collected is not being used for water-related expenditures, then it is unfair to the customers who are being charged the additional fee.
Response 6:
  Knowledge:
The columnist is arguing that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable because it goes against the principle of transparency and accountability in the use of public funds.

Choices:

A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.

This principle is relevant to the situation because the additional charge on water bills is being imposed on customers without their knowledge or consent. If the money is not being used for water-related expenditures, as the columnist argues, then it is unfair to the customers who are being charged the additional fee.

B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.

This principle is also relevant to the situation because the proposed dam would primarily benefit a specific community or region, rather than the entire community. If the additional revenue from water bills is being used for a project that only benefits a select group of people, then it is not being used in a fair and equitable manner.

C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.

This principle is relevant to the situation because the columnist is arguing that the additional charge on water bills is being imposed without the consent or approval of the majority of the utility's customers. If the customers do not approve of the project, then it is unfair to use their money to fund it.

D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.

This principle is not relevant to the situation because the columnist is arguing that the additional charge on water bills is being imposed without the necessary approval or oversight from the legislature. While it is true that the legislature should have a say in the use of public funds, the principle of transparency and accountability is also important in ensuring that public funds are being used fairly and equitably.

E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
  Great, let's evaluate the options:

A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
This option suggests that the placebo effect could be responsible for the observed improvement in the first group. While it is possible that the patients' expectations could have played a role in their perceived relief, this does not necessarily undermine the physician's argument that magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain. Therefore, this option is not the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.

B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
This option suggests that the physician's argument may be based on a common belief among physicians, but it does not necessarily follow that magnetic fields are ineffective. However, if most physicians believe that medication is more effective, it could be argued that the physician's argument is based on a flawed premise. Therefore, this option is a valid counter to the physician's argument.

C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
This option suggests that the observed effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain may be specific to that area, and may not generalize to other areas of the body. If this is the case, then the physician's argument may be based on a limited sample size and may not be applicable to other areas of the body. Therefore, this option is a valid counter to the physician's argument.

D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
This option suggests that the experiment may have been biased by the preexisting beliefs of the scientists involved in its design. If the scientists were already convinced that magnetic fields relieve back pain, they may have been more likely to interpret the results in a way that supports that belief. Therefore, this option is a valid counter to the physician's argument.

E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
This option suggests that the observed effectiveness of magnetic fields may be due to factors other than the direct effect of the magnetic fields on the pain. If the patients had different underlying causes of their chronic back pain, then the observed improvement may be due to factors other than the magnetic fields. Therefore, this option is a valid counter to the physician's argument.

Based on the above evaluation, the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument is option B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do. This option challenges the physician's argument by suggesting that the belief in the effectiveness of magnetic fields may be based on a flawed premise.

Therefore, this option is not the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.

B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
This option suggests that the physician's argument may be based on a common belief among physicians, but it does not necessarily follow that magnetic fields are ineffective. However, if most physicians believe that medication is more effective, it could be argued that the physician's argument is based on a flawed premise. Therefore, this option is a valid counter to the physician's argument.

C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
This option suggests that the observed effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain may be specific to that area, and may not generalize to other areas of the body. If this is the case, then the physician's argument may be based on a limited sample size and may not be applicable to other areas of the body. Therefore, this option is a valid counter to the physician's argument.

D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
This option suggests that the experiment may have been biased by the preexisting beliefs of the scientists involved in its design. If the scientists were already convinced that magnetic fields relieve back pain, they may have been more likely to interpret the results in a way that supports that belief. Therefore, this option is a valid counter to the physician's argument.

E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
This option suggests that the observed effectiveness of magnetic fields may be due to factors other than the direct effect of the magnetic fields on the pain. If the patients had different underlying causes of their chronic back pain, then the observed improvement may be due to factors other than the magnetic fields. Therefore, this option is a valid counter to the physician's argument.

Based on the above evaluation, the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument is option B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do. This option challenges the physician's argument by suggesting that the belief in the effectiveness of magnetic fields may be based on a flawed premise.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
  The correct answer is (C): People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.

The argument is that Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) is considered a commensal because it is present in the stomachs of many people without causing disease, but Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M tuberculosis) is not considered a commensal because it can cause tuberculosis. The argument is flawed because it assumes that the presence of a bacterium in the body is a determining factor in whether it is considered a commensal or not.

Option (C) challenges this assumption by pointing out that people who harbor M tuberculosis do not derive any benefit from its presence, just like people who harbor H pylori. This suggests that the distinction between commensals and non-commensals is not based on the potential benefits of the bacterium, but rather on the likelihood of disease caused by the bacterium.

 Options (A), (B), and (D) do not undermine the argument's reasoning, while option (E) is irrelevant to the argument.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Response 0:
  The author of the passage would most likely agree with statement (B): The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.

The passage highlights the limitations of the subtractive method in revealing the true nature of brain functions, particularly the modular theory of mind. The author argues that the method creates an illusion of localization by subtracting out distributed brain functions, which can give a false impression of neat functional localization. However, the author does not argue that the method is invalid for all purposes. Instead, the author suggests that the method may support Uttal's view that mental processes are distributed throughout the brain, rather than being localized to specific regions.

Therefore, option (B) best reflects the author's position on the subtractive method. Options (A) and (D) are not supported by the passage, as the author does not argue that the method is invalid for medical applications or that it creates an illusion of localization. Option (C) is also not supported, as the passage does not provide any evidence to suggest that brain scans of individuals experiencing anger show that emotions are not seated in the amygdala. Finally, option (E) is incorrect, as the passage does not suggest that the view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception
  D: questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence
  E: countering a revolutionary hypothesis
Response 0:
  The correct answer is (C): correcting a scientific misconception.

The passage explains that for centuries, scientists have assumed that wine, like other alcoholic beverages, has only one active ingredient, alcohol, and have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. However, recent research has shown that wine has healthful effects that are not seen with other alcoholic beverages. The author is correcting this scientific misconception by presenting evidence that suggests that the health benefits of wine may be due to the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes, which are not present in other alcoholic beverages.

The other options do not accurately describe the author's purpose:

* (A) advocating a particular method of treatment: The author is not advocating for a particular method of treatment, but rather presenting evidence to correct a scientific misconception.
* (B) criticizing popular opinion: The author is not criticizing popular opinion, but rather presenting evidence to challenge a long-held scientific assumption.
* (D) questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence: The author is not questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence, but rather presenting evidence to correct a scientific misconception.
* (E) countering a revolutionary hypothesis: The author is not countering a revolutionary hypothesis, but rather presenting evidence to correct a scientific misconception.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.
Response 0:
  The correct answer is (C): During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind is not supported by the findings of brain scans, which reveal well-defined areas that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks. However, the passage also acknowledges that the subtractive method used in brain scans can produce striking images of the brain at work, which may give the impression of neat functional localization. The passage argues that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and that the modular theory of mind is ultimately attractive because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method.

Therefore, option (C) is the most strongly supported by the passage, as it suggests that the brain scans do show areas of the brain that are most metabolically active during specific cognitive tasks, which supports the idea of functional localization. Options (A) and (B) are not supported by the passage, as they are not mentioned or implied. Option (D) is incorrect, as the passage does not provide information about the baseline measurements of oxygen use. Option (E) is also incorrect, as the passage does not mention anything about the brain scan showing areas of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity during emotional experiences.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.
Response 0:
  The correct answer is (C): Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.

This option best describes the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances. Just as mechanical components are necessary for the operation of clothing factories, primary substances are required for the growth and proper functioning of plants, while secondary substances are additional chemicals that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and serve various functions such as attracting pollinators or defending against insect enemies. Just as electrical components supply the power needed to run the mechanical components in a clothing factory, secondary substances are not directly involved in the internal chemical processes of plant growth or metabolism but are essential for the plant's survival and reproduction.

The other options do not accurately describe the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances:

* Option (A) does not accurately describe the relationship between hospitals and electrical power. While electrical power is essential for the proper functioning of hospitals, it is not a direct analogy to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
* Option (B) does not accurately describe the relationship between automobiles and mechanical components. While mechanical components are necessary for the operation of automobiles, they do not serve the same function as primary and secondary substances in plants.
* Option (D) does not accurately describe the relationship between trains and braking systems. While a braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop, it is not a direct analogy to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
* Option (E) does not accurately describe the relationship between computers and word processing programs. While specialized word processing programs are necessary for computers to function as word processors, they do not serve the same function as primary and secondary substances in plants.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.
  D: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
  E: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.
Response 0:
  Based on the passage, the best answer is (C): The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.

The passage explains that Schoenberg's music evolved through three different styles: a late-Romantic manner, a pushing of those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis, and the 12-tone technique. The author suggests that the second style represents a natural progression from the first, as people who enjoy the music of Brahms might also enjoy Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht. However, the passage also states that the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second, as Schoenberg pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.

Therefore, the best answer is (C), as the passage suggests that there is a natural progression from the first style to the second, but an inexplicable departure from the second to the third style.

Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience
Response 0:
  The answer is (B): a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.

The passage describes Schoenberg's music as disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths. Similarly, a comedian whose material shines a light on aspects of human nature that many people would prefer to ignore could also be considered disturbing in a similar way. Both Schoenberg's music and this type of comedy challenge the status quo and force the audience to confront uncomfortable realities.

Option (A) is not analogous to Schoenberg's music, as vulgar humor is not inherently disturbing or challenging. Option (C) is also not analogous, as material composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians is not likely to be disturbing in the same way as Schoenberg's music. Option (D) is also not analogous, as an extreme political philosophy is not inherently disturbing in the same way as Schoenberg's music. Finally, option (E) is not analogous, as an unfamiliar style of humor is not likely to be disturbing in the same way as Schoenberg's music.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.
Question: Which choice best describes the ways that the two authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society?
Choices:
  A: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.
  B: Tocqueville believes that an individual's economic class should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that class is not a legitimate consideration.
  C: Tocqueville believes that an individual's temperament should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that temperament should not be a factor in an individual's position.
  D: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by what is most beneficial to society, while Mill believes it should be determined by what an individual finds most rewarding. 41
Response 0:
  Great, let's dive into the question!

The two authors, Tocqueville and Mill, have different views on how an individual's proper position in society should be determined.

Tocqueville believes that an individual's sex plays a significant role in determining their proper position in society. He argues that men and women have different natural roles and abilities, and that society should be organized in a way that takes these differences into account. In his view, women are not equal to men in terms of their abilities and should not be treated as such.

On the other hand, Mill believes that an individual's abilities and talents should be the determining factor in their proper position in society. He argues that society should be organized in a way that allows individuals to exercise their faculties and talents to the fullest, regardless of their sex or any other characteristic.

Therefore, the best answer is (A): Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.

Here's a summary of the two authors' views on this topic:

Tocqueville:

* Believes that men and women have different natural roles and abilities.
* Argues that society should be organized in a way that takes these differences into account.
* Believes that women are not equal to men in terms of their abilities and should not be treated as such.

Mill:

* Believes that an individual's abilities and talents should be the determining factor in their proper position in society.
* Argues that society should be organized in a way that allows individuals to exercise their faculties and talents to the fullest, regardless of their sex or any other characteristic.
* Believes that individuals should have complete liberty of choice in their occupations.

Response 5:
  Great, let's dive into the question!

The two authors, Tocqueville and Mill, have different views on how an individual's proper position in society should be determined.

Tocqueville believes that an individual's sex plays a significant role in determining their proper position in society. He argues that men and women have different natural roles and abilities, and that society should be organized in a way that takes these differences into account. In his view, women are not equal to men in terms of their abilities and should not be treated as such.

On the other hand, Mill believes that an individual's abilities and talents should be the determining factor in their proper position in society. He argues that society should be organized in a way that allows individuals to exercise their faculties and talents to the fullest, regardless of their sex or any other characteristic.

Therefore, the best answer is (A): Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.

Here's a summary of the two authors' views on this topic:

Tocqueville:

* Believes that men and women have different natural roles and abilities.
* Argues that society should be organized in a way that takes these differences into account.
* Believes that women are not equal to men in terms of their abilities and should not be treated as such.

Mill:

* Believes that an individual's abilities and talents should be the determining factor in their proper position in society.
* Argues that society should be organized in a way that allows individuals to exercise their faculties and talents to the fullest, regardless of their sex or any other characteristic.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: Based on the passage, the researchers’ conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported in part by the fact that
Choices:
  A: no genetic variations were common to all those finches that were not also common to all the finches that did not use that technique.
  B: those finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
  C: the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
  D: there is probably not a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of that technique and its prior transmission to those finches.
Response 0:
  Knowledge:
The passage suggests that the researchers observed that five individual woodpecker finches developed a novel levering technique that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild. These finches significantly increased their use of this method after initial success with it.

Thought:

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.
Question: In Passage 1, Beecher makes which point about the status of women relative to that of men?
Choices:
  A: Women depend on men for their safety and security, but men are largely independent of women.
  B: Women are inferior to men, but women play a role as significant as that played by men.
  C: Women have fewer rights than men do, but women also have fewer responsibilities.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society
Question: It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that Parsons thinks positive social change will take place only when
Choices:
  A: masses of people are well versed in political history.
  B: political parties become committed to reform.
  C: fewer political parties are competing for people’s votes.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Large competitors are often viewed as a major.threat for startups and small companies; big.companies have more financial resources and greater.scale, market power and brand awareness than.smaller ones. However, our research finds that a.smaller brand can actually benefit if consumers can.see the competitive threat it faces from a larger.organization..When a U.S.-based ice cream chain with about 1,400 stores moved within 50 steps of a J.P. Licks ice.cream store in Newton, Massachusetts, some people.expected that J.P. Licks, a small, locally owned.company, would be beaten out of the Newton market..But consumers rallied around J.P. Licks, and the.national chain later closed its nearby location. When.the owner of the Los Angeles-based coffee store chain.The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf could not stop a large.coffee shop chain from moving in next door, he was.surprised to see his sales shoot up—so much so that.he started proactively colocating new stores next to.large chain ones..These examples are not anomalies. In six lab and.field studies, we explored the effects of having a large,.dominant competitor and found that highlighting a.large competitor’s size and close proximity can help.smaller brands, instead of harming them. Compared.to when they are in competition with brands that are.similar to them in size or when consumers view them.outside of a competitive context, small brands see.consumer support go up when they are faced with a.competitive threat from large brands. This support.translates into higher purchase intention, more.purchases and more favorable online reviews..As part of our research, we conducted a field study.at an independent bookstore in Cambridge,.Massachusetts. Upon entering the bookstore, 163.prospective shoppers were exposed to one of three.versions of an in-store ad, emphasizing either the.store’s large competitors, small competitors or no.competition. Shoppers who read the “large.competitors” version were told that the store’s main.competitors are large corporations that have the.ability to put small businesses such as this bookstore.out of business. The “small competitors” version.indicated the store’s main competitors are other.locally owned small bookstores in Cambridge. In the.“no competition” version, participants were given no.information about the competitive environment..Shoppers were then given a $5 coupon, coded with.the in-store ad version they read. Analyzing.shoppers’ sales receipts and the number of redeemed.coupons, we found that shoppers were significantly.more likely to make a purchase after reading the.“large competitors” version of the in-store ad,.compared to the “small competitors” version or the.“no competition” version. They also purchased more.items and spent more money at the store, compared.to shoppers reading the “small competitors” or “no.competition” versions. These results suggest that.framing the competitive game and emphasizing a.competitive narrative against a larger company can.help a small establishment—and spur consumers to.make a purchase that supports the smaller.competitor..In subsequent studies, we tested this “framing-.the-game” effect in various contexts and product.categories and further found that support for a large.brand decreases when consumers view it as being in.competition with a smaller brand. In one study, we.asked participants to assess two hypothetical rival tire.shops, “Tire World” and “Tire Planet,” under three.conditions—small vs. large, small vs. small or large.vs. large competitors. While participants indicated no.preference for the small or large shop when it was.competing against a competitor of similar size, the.small vs. large competitive context elicited a strong.preference for the small rather than large shop.
Question: The studies in the passage suggest that if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, a likely result is that the large store would
Choices:
  A: receive more positive reviews from its customers.
  B: gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops.
  C: benefit from people's perception that its competition is now even greater.
  D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
Response 0:
  Knowledge: The passage suggests that highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands, rather than harming them.

Thought: If customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, it is likely that the large store would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops. This is because the information highlighting the large competitor's size and close proximity could lead consumers to perceive the large store as a threat to the smaller shops, rather than as a unique offering with its own advantages.

Criticism: The passage does not provide evidence to suggest that the large store would receive more positive reviews from its customers or gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops. In fact, the passage suggests the opposite, as highlighting the large competitor's size and close proximity could lead consumers to prefer the smaller brand.

Criticism: The passage does not provide evidence to suggest that the large store would receive more positive reviews from its customers or gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops. In fact, the passage suggests the opposite, as highlighting the large competitor's size and close proximity could lead consumers to prefer the smaller brand.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.
Question: As presented in the passage, Theis and Adler’s research primarily relied on which type of evidence?
Choices:
  A: Direct observation
  B: Historical data
  C: Expert testimony
  D: Random sampling
Response 0:
  Knowledge:
Theis and Adler's research primarily relied on direct observation and experimental data. They conducted experiments by planting 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and manipulating the fragrance of the flowers by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside the flowers. They also observed the behavior of pollinators and beetles on the fragrant and control flowers and measured the seed set of the flowers.

Thought:
The passage states that the researchers "spent the next several hours walking from flower to flower, observing each for two-minute intervals and writing down everything they saw." This suggests that the evidence relied on was direct observation of the flowers and their pollinators. Additionally, the experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that more fragrant flowers would attract more pollinators, so the evidence is primarily based on experimental data.

Criticism:
The passage does not provide any information that would suggest the use of historical data or expert testimony in the research. Theis and Adler's findings are based on their direct observations and experiments, and there is no mention of any historical data or expert opinions being used to support their conclusions.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.
Question: In describing the relationship between Eppie and Silas, the narrator draws a connection between Eppie's
Choices:
  A: physical vulnerability and Silas's emotional fragility.
  B: expanding awareness and Silas's increasing engagement with life.
  C: boundless energy and Silas's insatiable desire for wealth.
  D: physical growth and Silas's painful perception of his own mortality.
Response 0:
  Knowledge:
The passage describes the relationship between Eppie and Silas as one of mutual dependence and care. Eppie, as a young child, is full of energy and curiosity, while Silas is an older man who has lost his sight and is emotionally vulnerable.

Thought:
The narrator highlights the contrast between Eppie's boundless energy and Silas's emotional fragility, suggesting that Eppie's youth and vitality bring joy and hope to Silas's life, while also challenging him to engage with the world in new ways.

Criticism:
The passage does not suggest that Eppie's physical growth is directly related to Silas's perception of his own mortality. While Silas is certainly aware of his own aging and mortality, the passage does not emphasize this aspect of their relationship.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."
Question: What can reasonably be inferred about the reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study?
Choices:
  A: The ibises were well acquainted with their migration route.
  B: Usherwood knew the ibises were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration.
  C: The ibises have a body design that is similar to that of a modern airplane.
  D: The ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.
Response 0:
  Knowledge:
The study used northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) as the subjects because they are endangered and their migration route was already known through an existing project.

Thought:
Usherwood likely chose the ibises as the subjects of his study because they have big wings that are well-suited for drafting, and their flight patterns are similar to those of other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese.

Criticism:
The choice of subjects is reasonable because ibises are large birds with long wingspans, which makes them ideal for studying the aerodynamic benefits of flying in a V formation. Additionally, the researchers were able to track the birds' flight patterns and wing movements using data loggers, providing valuable data on the birds' flight behavior.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
Response 0:
 Knowledge:

The conversion factors given in the box are:

1 decagram = 10 grams
1,000 milligrams = 1 gram

Thought:

To find the number of 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container, we need to convert the volume of the container from decagrams to milligrams.

2 decagrams = 20 grams (since 1 decagram = 10 grams)

So, one 2-decagram container contains 40 grams (2 x 20 grams).

Now, we can convert 40 grams to milligrams:

40 grams = 40,000 milligrams (since 1 gram = 1,000 milligrams)

Therefore, there are 40,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Criticism:

The answer is C: 2,000.

Explanation:

The question states that the hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. This means that each container contains 20 grams of medicine.

The conversion factor given in the box is 1 decagram = 10 grams. So, we can convert 20 grams to decagrams:

20 grams = 2 decagrams (since 1 decagram = 10 grams)

Now, we can use the conversion factor again to convert 2 decagrams to milligrams:

2 decagrams = 20,000 milligrams (since 1 decagram = 10,000 milligrams)

20 grams = 2 decagrams (since 1 decagram = 10 grams)

Now, we can use the conversion factor again to convert 2 decagrams to milligrams:

2 decagrams = 20,000 milligrams (since 1 decagram = 10,000 milligrams)

Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
 Knowledge:

The conversion factors given in the box are:

1 decagram = 10 grams
1,000 milligrams = 1 gram

Thought:

To find the number of 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container, we need to convert the volume of the container from decagrams to milligrams.

2 decagrams = 20 grams (since 1 decagram = 10 grams)

So, one 2-decagram container contains 40 grams (2 x 20 grams).

Now, we can convert 40 grams to milligrams:

40 grams = 40,000 milligrams (since 1 gram = 1,000 milligrams)

Therefore, there are 40,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Criticism:

The answer is C: 2,000.

Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$
Response 0:
  Knowledge:

The probability of a person recalling a dream is dependent on their bedtime. Group X observed early bedtimes, while Group Y observed later bedtimes.

Action:

Let's analyze the data in the table:

Group X: 15 people recalled 1-4 dreams, 57 people recalled 5 or more dreams, and 100 people recalled at least one dream.

Group Y: 21 people recalled 1-4 dreams, 68 people recalled 5 or more dreams, and 100 people recalled at least one dream.

Total: 36 people recalled 1-4 dreams, 125 people recalled 5 or more dreams, and 200 people recalled at least one dream.

Now, let's calculate the probability of a person belonging to Group Y:

Probability of a person belonging to Group Y = Number of people in Group Y / Total number of people
= 68 / 200
= 34

Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least one dream belongs to Group Y is 34/100 or B: $\frac{79}{100}$.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If $x>3$, which of the following is equivalent to $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{2 x+5}{x^{2}+5 x+6}$
  B: $\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$
  C: $2 x+5$
  D: $x^{2}+5 x+6$
Response 0:
  Knowledge:

The expression $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}}$ can be simplified using the formula for the reciprocal of a fraction: $\frac{1}{a+b} = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot \frac{b}{a+b}$.

In this case, we have:

$$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{x+2}{x+2} \cdot \frac{x+3}{x+3} = \frac{x+5}{x+6}$$

Therefore, the equivalent expression is:

$$\frac{2 x+5}{x^{2}+5 x+6}$$

Which is option A.

Thought:

I understand that the question is asking for the equivalent expression of $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}}$ given that $x>3$. I know that the reciprocal of a fraction can be simplified using the formula $\frac{a}{a+b} \cdot \frac{b}{a+b} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{a+b} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{a+b}$, so I can simplify the expression by factoring out the common denominator and simplifying the numerators.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Science
Question: Why does sexual reproduction result in more genetic diversity than asexual reproduction?
Choices:
  A: Traits from two parents are combined.
  B: More organisms reproduce this way.
  C: Offspring grow in different environments.
  D: Offspring come from identical parents.
Response 0:
 Knowledge:
Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes (sex cells) from two parents, resulting in offspring with a unique combination of genetic traits from each parent. This leads to genetic diversity in the offspring, as the combination of genes from the two parents is not the same as either parent.

A: Traits from two parents are combined.
This is the main reason why sexual reproduction results in more genetic diversity than asexual reproduction. By combining genetic traits from two parents, sexual reproduction creates a wider range of possible genetic combinations in the offspring.

B: More organisms reproduce this way.
While it is true that more organisms reproduce sexually than asexually, this is not the primary reason for the increase in genetic diversity. The key factor is the combination of genetic traits from two parents, which leads to a greater variety of possible genetic combinations.

C: Offspring grow in different environments.
While offspring may grow in different environments, this does not directly affect the genetic diversity of the offspring. The genetic diversity of the offspring is determined by the combination of genetic traits from the parents, not by the environment in which the offspring grow.

D: Offspring come from identical parents.
This is not a valid option, as offspring from identical parents would have the same genetic traits and would not exhibit genetic diversity.

Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes (sex cells) from two parents, resulting in offspring with a unique combination of genetic traits from each parent. This leads to genetic diversity in the offspring, as the combination of genes from the two parents is not the same as either parent.

A: Traits from two parents are combined.
This is the main reason why sexual reproduction results in more genetic diversity than asexual reproduction. By combining genetic traits from two parents, sexual reproduction creates a wider range of possible genetic combinations in the offspring.

B: More organisms reproduce this way.
While it is true that more organisms reproduce sexually than asexually, this is not the primary reason for the increase in genetic diversity. The key factor is the combination of genetic traits from two parents, which leads to a greater variety of possible genetic combinations.

C: Offspring grow in different environments.
While offspring may grow in different environments, this does not directly affect the genetic diversity of the offspring. The genetic diversity of the offspring is determined by the combination of genetic traits from the parents, not by the environment in which the offspring grow.

D: Offspring come from identical parents.
This is not a valid option, as offspring from identical parents would have the same genetic traits and would not exhibit genetic diversity.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Science
Question: Why is water from an aquifer more likely to be cleaner than water from other sources?
Choices:
  A: because it forms where fresh and salt water meet
  B: because it receives water directly from precipitation
  C: because it rises to the surface near the ocean
  D: because pollutants are filtered by rock and soil deep within Earth
Response 0:
 Knowledge:

Water from an aquifer is more likely to be cleaner than water from other sources because it is filtered and purified as it moves through the rock and soil layers of the Earth's crust. Aquifers are underground layers of permeable rock, sand, or soil that store water. As water flows through the aquifer, it passes through layers of rock and soil that act as natural filters, removing impurities and contaminants.

Choices:

A: This is incorrect. Aquifers do not form where fresh and salt water meet. Aquifers are underground layers of permeable rock, sand, or soil that store water.

B: This is partially correct. Water from an aquifer can receive water directly from precipitation, but the primary source of water in an aquifer is not precipitation.

C: This is incorrect. Water from an aquifer does not rise to the surface near the ocean. Aquifers are underground layers of permeable rock, sand, or soil that store water.

D: This is correct. Water from an aquifer is more likely to be cleaner than water from other sources because pollutants are filtered by rock and soil deep within the Earth's crust.

As water flows through the aquifer, it passes through layers of rock and soil that act as natural filters, removing impurities and contaminants.

Choices:

A: This is incorrect. Aquifers do not form where fresh and salt water meet. Aquifers are underground layers of permeable rock, sand, or soil that store water.

B: This is partially correct. Water from an aquifer can receive water directly from precipitation, but the primary source of water in an aquifer is not precipitation.

C: This is incorrect. Water from an aquifer does not rise to the surface near the ocean. Aquifers are underground layers of permeable rock, sand, or soil that store water.

D: This is correct. Water from an aquifer is more likely to be cleaner than water from other sources because pollutants are filtered by rock and soil deep within the Earth's crust.

Thought:

Based on the knowledge provided, the answer is D: because pollutants are filtered by rock and soil deep within the Earth's crust. The water in an aquifer is filtered and purified as it moves through the rock and soil layers of the Earth's crust, making it more likely to be cleaner than water from other sources.

* Camels are large, even-toed ungulates native to the hot, arid deserts of the Middle East and North Africa.
* Camels are known for their ability to travel long distances in hot, dry conditions with minimal water intake.
* Camel rides are a popular tourist activity in many desert regions.

Thought:

* The text mentions two women sitting on a small camel, which suggests that they are on a camel ride.
* The woman on the back of the camel is likely holding onto the camel's hump or saddle for balance and support.
* The woman on the front of the camel is likely holding onto the camel's reins to guide it.
* The most likely completion to the text is B: starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.

Criticism:

* The text does not provide any context or information about the setting of the camel ride, so it is not possible to determine the likelihood of the other options.
* Option A: looks at her phone while the two women hold the camel down, is unlikely as it would be difficult to see her phone while sitting on a moving camel.
* Option C: waves at the camera, is also unlikely as the text does not mention any other people or a camera.
* Option D: is running and with other people walking alongside it, is highly unlikely as camels are not known for their speed or ability to run, and it would be dangerous to run alongside a moving camel.

Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make your hair stay straight all day [title] Use shampoos and conditioners that help straighten hair. [step] Look for shampoos and conditioners that have lots of vitamins and minerals in them, giving your hair refreshing nutrients that will help smooth it out. These are usually marketed as smoothing, sleek, or straightening products.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Look for a shampoo that lists " hydrating ingredients ", which are sodium and other all natural ingredients. You can also try going for one that specifically states " hydrating " on the bottle.
  B: [substeps] If you have very curly hair, you may need to consider using a straightening shampoo. You can also purchase a hair-straightening powder and conditioners to help moisturize your hair.
  C: If you have dry hair, look for shampoos that will keep it soft, wet, and shine. If you have hair that is frizzy, opt for sleek, volumizing, or foam shampoos.
  D: [substeps] Look for ingredients such as wheat proteins, pro vitamin b5, or hedera helix extract. Take the time to comb the conditioner into your hair while in the shower, using your fingers or a wide-toothed comb.

  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

B: Know your child's developmental milestones before setting expectations.

Explanation:

  The most likely completion to the text is:

B: You could be required to investigate allegations of neglect and remove children from the homes of their parents. You may need a police escort for some situations, and you will likely encounter people who are hostile toward you.

Explanation:

The text describes child protective services (CPS) as a job that involves overtime, irregular hours, and entering dangerous situations. It also mentions that CPS workers may need a police escort in some situations and will likely encounter people who are hostile towards them. This suggests that the job of a CPS worker can be challenging and potentially dangerous.

Option A is unlikely because it suggests that CPS workers may have to help someone who is trying to get sick, but it does not provide any context or explanation for how this would be relevant to the job of a CPS worker.

Option C is also unlikely because it suggests that all employers must provide constant monitoring of their employees, which is not a realistic or practical expectation for most workplaces.

Option D is the least likely choice because it suggests that the work program primarily functions when a child has a medical issue or is feeling depressed or unwell. While it is possible that CPS workers may be involved in assessing and providing support to children with medical issues, the text does not suggest that this is the primary focus of their work.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Health
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make a homemade ear cleaner [title] Get a small bottle. [step] You can either get an ear dropper bottle or a small (1 oz) brown bottle with an eye-dropper cap. [title] Fill the bottle with your chosen oil.
Choices:
  A: [step] Make sure that the bottle is small enough to hold all of the oil you'll be adding to it. [substeps] Oil from your choice of product may not soften your ear canal to the point where it won't fit over a toothbrush.
  B: [step] Use either mineral oil or olive oil. [substeps] Oil-based cleaners have the advantage of lubricating the ear canal.
  C: [step] Add distilled water to make the bottle easier to clean. Test the ear cleaner on a small, hidden area of your ear while it is still in the bottle.
  D: [step] You can use any type of oil, but don't add more than 10 drops if you want to replicate this scent. Keep dilufying the oil between 5-10 drops.
Response 0:
 Knowledge:

The article is providing instructions on how to make a homemade ear cleaner using a small bottle. The article mentions that the bottle should be small enough to hold the oil you will be adding to it, and suggests using either mineral oil or olive oil as the cleaning agent.

Choices:

A: Make sure that the bottle is small enough to hold all of the oil you'll be adding to it.

Explanation: This option is incorrect because the article states that the bottle should be small enough to hold the oil, but does not specify a minimum size. Using a bottle that is too large may result in the oil not being able to fully dissolve in the water, which could make the ear cleaner less effective.

B: Use either mineral oil or olive oil.

Explanation: This option is correct. The article suggests using either mineral oil or olive oil as the cleaning agent, as they both have the advantage of lubricating the ear canal.

C: Add distilled water to make the bottle easier to clean. Test the ear cleaner on a small, hidden area of your ear while it is still in the bottle.

Explanation: This option is incorrect because it goes against the instructions provided in the article. The article does not suggest adding distilled water to the bottle, and testing the ear cleaner on a small, hidden area of the ear while it is still in the bottle could potentially cause irritation or infection.

D: You can use any type of oil, but don't add more than 10 drops if you want to replicate this scent. Keep diluting the oil between 5-10 drops.

Explanation: This option is incorrect because it goes against the instructions provided in the article. The article does not suggest using any type of oil, and does not provide a specific amount of oil to use. Adding more than 10 drops of oil could make the ear cleaner too strong and potentially irritate the ear canal.

Thought:

Based on the information provided in the article, the most likely completion to the text is B: Use either mineral oil or olive oil. This is because the article specifically mentions these two types of oil as options for the cleaning agent, and does not provide any other suggestions.

Criticism:

The article does not provide clear instructions on how to make the homemade ear cleaner, and the options provided are not accurate. The article should provide a specific size range for the bottle, and should clarify whether or not to add distilled water to the bottle. Additionally, the article should provide more information on the types of oil that can be used as the cleaning agent, and should provide specific amounts for each type of oil.

D: You can use any type of oil, but don't add more than 10 drops if you want to replicate this scent. Keep diluting the oil between 5-10 drops.

Explanation: This option is incorrect because it goes against the instructions provided in the article. The article does not suggest using any type of oil, and does not provide a specific amount of oil to use. Adding more than 10 drops of oil could make the ear cleaner too strong and potentially irritate the ear canal.

Thought:

Based on the information provided in the article, the most likely completion to the text is B: Use either mineral oil or olive oil. This is because the article specifically mentions these two types of oil as options for the cleaning agent, and does not provide any other suggestions.

Criticism:

The article does not provide clear instructions on how to make the homemade ear cleaner, and the options provided are not accurate. The article should provide a specific size range for the bottle, and should clarify whether or not to add distilled water to the bottle. Additionally, the article should provide more information on the types of oil that can be used as the cleaning agent, and should provide specific amounts for each type of oil.
Response 6:
 Knowledge:

The article is providing instructions on how to make a homemade ear cleaner using a small bottle. The article mentions that the bottle should be small enough to hold the oil you will be adding to it, and suggests using either mineral oil or olive oil as the cleaning agent.

Choices:

A: Make sure that the bottle is small enough to hold all of the oil you'll be adding to it.

Explanation: This option is incorrect because the article states that the bottle should be small enough to hold the oil, but does not specify a minimum size. Using a bottle that is too large may result in the oil not being able to fully dissolve in the water, which could make the ear cleaner less effective.

B: Use either mineral oil or olive oil.

Explanation: This option is correct. The article suggests using either mineral oil or olive oil as the cleaning agent, as they both have the advantage of lubricating the ear canal.

C: Add distilled water to make the bottle easier to clean. Test the ear cleaner on a small, hidden area of your ear while it is still in the bottle.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Gynaecology & Obstetrics
Question: What is the level of proteinuria to diagnose severe preeclampsia?
Choices:
  A: 20 mg
  B: 200 mg
  C: 300 mg
  D: 3000 mg
Response 0:
 Knowledge:
Severe preeclampsia is typically defined as having proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) of 3+ on a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (P/C ratio) or 2+ on a 24-hour urine protein collection.

The level of proteinuria required to diagnose severe preeclampsia may vary depending on the source, but generally, it is considered to be:

* 3+ on a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (P/C ratio): ≥0.5 g/day
* 2+ on a 24-hour urine protein collection: ≥500 mg/day

Choices:

A: 20 mg - This is an extremely low amount of proteinuria and is not sufficient to diagnose severe preeclampsia.

B: 200 mg - This is a moderate amount of proteinuria and may indicate severe preeclampsia, but it is not the level required to diagnose it definitively.

C: 300 mg - This is a moderate to high amount of proteinuria and may indicate severe preeclampsia.

D: 3000 mg - This is an extremely high amount of proteinuria and is likely to diagnose severe preeclampsia.

Thought:
Based on the knowledge provided, the level of proteinuria required to diagnose severe preeclampsia is likely to be in the range of 200-300 mg. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 200 mg.

Criticism:
The answer provided is based on the knowledge and information available, but it is important to note that the exact level of proteinuria required to diagnose severe preeclampsia may vary depending on the source and the individual case. It is important to consult a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.

The level of proteinuria required to diagnose severe preeclampsia may vary depending on the source, but generally, it is considered to be:

* 3+ on a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (P/C ratio): ≥0.5 g/day
* 2+ on a 24-hour urine protein collection: ≥500 mg/day

Choices:

A: 20 mg - This is an extremely low amount of proteinuria and is not sufficient to diagnose severe preeclampsia.

B: 200 mg - This is a moderate amount of proteinuria and may indicate severe preeclampsia, but it is not the level required to diagnose it definitively.

C: 300 mg - This is a moderate to high amount of proteinuria and may indicate severe preeclampsia.

D: 3000 mg - This is an extremely high amount of proteinuria and is likely to diagnose severe preeclampsia.

Thought:
Based on the knowledge provided, the level of proteinuria required to diagnose severe preeclampsia is likely to be in the range of 200-300 mg. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 200 mg.

### Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Physiology
Question: The primary site of action of antidiuretic hormone is on the:
Choices:
  A: Distal tubules and collecting ducts in the kidney
  B: Afferent arterioles of the glomeruli
  C: Thirst center in the hypothalamus
  D: Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus
Response 0:
 Knowledge:
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine vasopressin (AVP), is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus in the brain that regulates water balance in the body.

The primary site of action of ADH is on the distal tubules and collecting ducts in the kidney. ADH acts on the V2 receptors in these tubules and ducts, causing water reabsorption and reducing urine production. This helps to conserve water in the body and maintain proper fluid balance.

Option B is incorrect because the afferent arterioles of the glomeruli are not the primary site of action of ADH. While ADH can affect blood pressure by constricting or dilating the afferent arterioles, its primary action is on the kidney tubules and ducts.

Option C is also incorrect because the thirst center in the hypothalamus is not directly involved in the regulation of ADH secretion. While the hypothalamus does play a role in regulating thirst and water balance, ADH secretion is primarily controlled by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Option D is incorrect because osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus are involved in the regulation of blood pressure, but not directly in the regulation of ADH secretion.

Thought:
Based on the knowledge provided, the primary site of action of ADH is on the distal tubules and collecting ducts in the kidney. Therefore, the best answer is option A.

Question: Cells most commonly affected in glaucomatous optic atrophy?
Choices:
  A: Amacrine cells
  B: Bipolar cells
  C: Ganglion cells
  D: Rods and cones
Response 0:
 Knowledge:
Glaucomatous optic atrophy is a condition where the optic nerve is damaged due to elevated intraocular pressure, leading to visual field loss and visual impairment. The cells most commonly affected in glaucomatous optic atrophy are the ganglion cells.

Cells most commonly affected in glaucomatous optic atrophy:

Choices:
  A: TVS
  B: hysteroscopy
  C: Endometrial biopsy
  D: chromosomal abnormalities
Response 0:
 Knowledge:
A female patient who has a history of two second-trimester abortions may have underlying fertility issues, and preconceptual counseling is essential to identify potential risks and optimize the chances of a successful pregnancy.

Options:

A: TVS (Transvaginal ultrasound) - This is a non-invasive imaging test that can help identify any structural abnormalities in the uterus, such as septum, fibroids, or adhesions, which may affect fertility.

B: Hysteroscopy - This is a minimally invasive procedure that allows the healthcare provider to visualize the inside of the uterus and identify any abnormalities, such as polyps or fibroids, that may be affecting fertility.

C: Endometrial biopsy - This test involves removing a small sample of tissue from the lining of the uterus to check for any abnormalities, such as thickening or polyps, that may be affecting fertility.

D: Chromosomal abnormalities - This option refers to genetic testing to identify any chromosomal abnormalities that may be affecting fertility.

Thought:
Based on the patient's history of two second-trimester abortions, it is essential to identify any underlying fertility issues. Hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy can help identify any structural abnormalities in the uterus, while TVS can help identify any uterine anomalies. Chromosomal abnormalities may also be a possibility, given the patient's history of recurrent abortions.

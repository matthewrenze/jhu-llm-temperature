Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75 employees take a winter vacation, 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations, and 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacations. 

Let's find out how many employees take at least one vacation: 
75 (winter) + x (summer only) + 40 (both) = 100 - 20 (neither)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 5

So, 80 employees take at least one vacation (75 winter + 5 summer only). 

Now, let's find out how many employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation:
x (summer only) - 40 (both) = y (summer only, not winter)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
y = x - 40
y = 5 - 40
y = -35

Since we can't have a negative number of employees, the answer must be 0. Therefore, 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Question: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 10
  C: 12
  D: 15
  E: 19
Response 0:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes.
So, the number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 2 * x * 3 = 6x
And, the number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 35 * x * 3 = 105x
Now, we need to solve the following equations to find the value of x:
6x >= 20 (at least 20 large cakes are needed)
105x >= 700 (at least 700 small cakes are needed)
Solving the above equations, we get:
x >= 10/3 (we can't have a fraction of a helper, so we need at least 4 helpers)
x >= 20/3 (we can't have a fraction of a helper, so we need at least 7 helpers)
Therefore, we need at least 7 helpers to make the required number of cakes.

The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced = 90% of x = 0.9x

Now, out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 2% of 0.9x = 0.018x

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So, we can set up the following equation:

0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4000.

Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
Choices:
  A: 80
  B: 120
  C: 240
  D: 320
  E: 360
Response 0:
Let's start by finding out how many golf balls were sold. 

80% of 600 = 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls were sold.

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, half of the 480 sold golf balls were white. Therefore, 240 white golf balls were sold.

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the remaining 360 golf balls must be yellow.

Question: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
Choices:
  A: $8
  B: $10
  C: $13.6
  D: $22.9
  E: $40
Response 0:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x.
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so she spent $300 on (5+x) articles.
We can write this as: 300 = (5+x) * 0.85x
Simplifying this equation, we get: x^2 - 4x + 60 = 0
Solving this quadratic equation, we get: x = 2 ± 2√7
Since the original price cannot be negative, we take x = 2 + 2√7
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x = 0.85(2 + 2√7) = $13.6 (approx)

Question: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope?
Choices:
  A: 7.5
  B: 8.9
  C: 9.9
  D: 11.5
  E: 11.7
Response 0:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. Then the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3. We know that the sum of the lengths of the two pieces of rope is 20, so we can write an equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Simplifying the left side, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides, we get:

2x = 23

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Response 6:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. Then the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3. We know that the sum of the lengths of the two pieces of rope is 20, so we can write an equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Simplifying the left side, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides, we get:

2x = 23

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months = $554,400

To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue from sales must be:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + Desired profit = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced per year:
Minimum selling price per component = Yearly revenue / Number of components produced per year
Number of components produced per year = 420 units/month x 12 months = 5,040 units/year

Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units/year = $234/unit

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months = $554,400

To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue from sales must be:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + Desired profit = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced per year:
Minimum selling price per component = Yearly revenue / Number of components produced per year
Number of components produced per year = 420 units/month x 12 months = 5,040 units/year

Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units/year = $234/unit

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 62
  C: 82
  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Let's solve this problem using algebra. 

Let x be the first integer, then the sum of k consecutive integers is:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1)

We know that the least integer is -50, so x = -50. Substituting this value, we get:

-50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51

Simplifying the left side, we get:

k(-50) + (1+2+3+...+(k-1)) = 51

k(-50) + (k-1)k/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

2k(-50) + k(k-1) = 102

Simplifying and rearranging, we get a quadratic equation:

k^2 - 51k + 100 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

k = (51 ± sqrt(51^2 - 4*1*100))/2

k = (51 ± sqrt(2497))/2

k ≈ 50.2 or k ≈ 0.8

Since k has to be a positive integer, the only possible value is:

k = 51

Therefore, the answer is:

Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
Response 0:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. 

The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. We know that the area of a triangle is given by the formula (1/2) * base * height. Since the two triangles are congruent, their bases and heights are equal. Let's assume that the base and height of each triangle are b and h, respectively. Then we have:

(1/2) * b * h = 70

b * h = 140

Since the rectangular piece was cut diagonally in half to create two congruent triangles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal. We have:

diagonal^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2

diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16

diagonal = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)

Since the two triangles are congruent, each triangle has half the area of the rectangular piece. Therefore, we have:

(1/2) * (x-4) * x = 2 * 70

x^2 - 4x - 280 = 0

Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get:

x = 14 or x = -20

Since x represents a length, we can discard the negative solution. Therefore, x = 14 feet.

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x = 56 feet.

Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:
  A: 46
  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
Let's denote the length of the painted sides as x and y. We know that x + y + 9 = 37, which means x + y = 28. We also know that the area of the rectangle is given by A = xy. We can use the fact that (x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy to find xy as follows:

(x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy
(28)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy
784 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy

We can substitute x + y = 28 into the equation above to get:

784 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = (x + y)^2 = 28^2
x^2 + y^2 + 2xy - 784 = 0
(x - y)^2 = 784 - 4xy

We know that xy is the area of the rectangle, so we want to find xy. We also know that x + y = 28, so we can solve for y in terms of x:

y = 28 - x

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

(x - (28 - x))^2 = 784 - 4xy
(2x - 28)^2 = 784 - 4xy
4x^2 - 112x + 784 = 784 - 4xy
xy = x(28 - x)

Now we can substitute xy = x(28 - x) into the equation above to get:

(2x - 28)^2 = 4x(28 - x)
x^2 - 28x + 196 = 0
(x - 14)^2 = 0

So x = 14, which means y = 28 - x = 14. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is A = xy = 14 * 14 = 196 square feet.

(x - y)^2 = 784 - 4xy

We know that xy is the area of the rectangle, so we want to find xy. We also know that x + y = 28, so we can solve for y in terms of x:

y = 28 - x

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

4x^2 - 112x + 784 = 784 - 4xy
xy = x(28 - x)

Now we can substitute xy = x(28 - x) into the equation above to get:

(2x - 28)^2 = 4x(28 - x)
x^2 - 28x + 196 = 0
(x - 14)^2 = 0

We know that xy is the area of the rectangle, so we want to find xy. We also know that x + y = 28, so we can solve for y in terms of x:

y = 28 - x

(2x - 28)^2 = 784 - 4xy
4x^2 - 112x + 784 = 784 - 4xy
xy = x(28 - x)

Now we can substitute xy = x(28 - x) into the equation above to get:

(2x - 28)^2 = 4x(28 - x)
x^2 - 28x + 196 = 0
(x - 14)^2 = 0

Now we can substitute xy = x(28 - x) into the equation above to get:

(2x - 28)^2 = 4x(28 - x)
x^2 - 28x + 196 = 0
(x - 14)^2 = 0

So x = 14, which means y = 28 - x = 14. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is A = xy = 14 * 14 = 196 square feet.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let's denote the length of the painted sides as x and y. We know that x + y + 9 = 37, which means x + y = 28. We also know that the area of the rectangle is given by A = xy. We can use the fact that (x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy to find xy as follows:

(x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy
(28)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy
784 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy

We can substitute x + y = 28 into the equation above to get:

784 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = (x + y)^2 = 28^2
x^2 + y^2 + 2xy - 784 = 0
(x - y)^2 = 784 - 4xy

We know that xy is the area of the rectangle, so we want to find xy. We also know that x + y = 28, so we can solve for y in terms of x:

y = 28 - x

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

(x - (28 - x))^2 = 784 - 4xy
(2x - 28)^2 = 784 - 4xy
4x^2 - 112x + 784 = 784 - 4xy
xy = x(28 - x)

Now we can substitute xy = x(28 - x) into the equation above to get:

(2x - 28)^2 = 4x(28 - x)
x^2 - 28x + 196 = 0
(x - 14)^2 = 0

So x = 14, which means y = 28 - x = 14. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is A = xy = 14 * 14 = 196 square feet.

Question: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 8
  C: 22
  D: 50
  E: 20
Response 0:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of work is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the remaining one-third of the work is left to be done. 

Let's represent the remaining work by the variable "R". Therefore, 

R = W - (2/3)W = (1/3)W 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, her rate of work is (5/100) * (1/12) = (1/240) of the yacht per hour. 

Let's represent the time taken by Jill to finish the remaining work by the variable "t". Therefore, 

(R/t) = (1/240) 

Solving for "t", we get: 

t = (R / (1/240)) = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 

Therefore, Jill takes 80 hours to finish the remaining work.

Question: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 30
  C: 45
  D: 60
  E: 75
Response 0:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Then, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. And, it buys 1 newspaper each day from Tuesday to Saturday. 

The total cost of buying newspapers for a week is $210. Therefore, we can write the equation:

2(4) + 1(x + x + 5) = 210

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + 2x + 5 = 210
2x = 197
x = 98.5

Since the hotel cannot buy half a newspaper, we can round up the value of x to the nearest integer. Therefore, the hotel buys 99 newspapers on Monday.

Question: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
Choices:
  A: 144km
  B: 72 km
  C: 126km
  D: 84 km
  E: 48km
Response 0:
Let the distance between X and Y be d. Let the time taken for them to meet for the first time be t. Then, we have:

Distance covered by Allen = 54t
Distance covered by Bob = 78t

When they meet for the first time, the sum of the distances covered by both of them is equal to d:

54t + 78t = d

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

132t = d

When they meet for the second time, Allen would have covered a distance of d, while Bob would have covered a distance of 2d - 48 (since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen). We can set up another equation using this information:

Distance covered by Allen = Distance covered by Bob - 48

54(2t) = 78(2t) - 48

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

t = 4

Substituting t = 4 in the equation 132t = d, we get:

d = 528

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 528 km.

Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
Response 0:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

d = s x 6   -----(1)

d = (s+12) x 4   -----(2)

From equation (1), we get:

s = d/6

Substituting the value of s in equation (2), we get:

d = (d/6 + 12) x 4

d = (2d/3 + 24)

d/3 = 24

d = 72 x 3

d = 216 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 216 km.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

d = s x 6   -----(1)

d = (s+12) x 4   -----(2)

From equation (1), we get:

s = d/6

Substituting the value of s in equation (2), we get:

d = (d/6 + 12) x 4

d = (2d/3 + 24)

d/3 = 24

d = 72 x 3

Topic: Math
Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 28
  C: 30
  D: 53
  E: 59
Response 0:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula: N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/k), where N(t) is the number of water lilies at time t, N0 is the initial number of water lilies, k is the doubling time, and t is the time elapsed.

We know that N(60) = 2^30, since the number of water lilies doubles every two days for 60 days. We also know that N(0) = 64, since initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake. 

To find the doubling time k, we can use the formula: 2^k = 2, since the number of water lilies doubles every two days. Therefore, k = 1.

Now we can solve for t: 

N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/k)
64 * 2^(t/1) = 2^30
2^(6+t) = 2^30
6+t = 30
t = 24

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 24 days if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800

Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75 employees take a winter vacation, 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations, and 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacations. 

Therefore, the number of employees who take at least one vacation is 100 - 20 = 80. 

We can then calculate that the number of employees who take only a winter vacation is 75 - 40 = 35. 

So, the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 40 - 35 = 5. 

Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is (5/100) x 100 = 5%. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75 employees take a winter vacation, 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations, and 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacations. 

Let's find out how many employees take at least one vacation: 
75 (winter) + x (summer only) + 40 (both) = 100 - 20 (neither)
Simplifying the equation, we get: 
x = 5

So, 80 employees take at least one vacation (75 winter + 5 summer only). 

Now, let's find out how many employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation: 
x (summer only) - 40 (both) = y (summer only)
Simplifying the equation, we get: 
y = -35

Since we can't have a negative number of employees, we know that the answer is "None of the Above". However, the most likely answer is that there is an error in the question or the answer choices, and the correct answer is not provided.
Response 3:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75% of them take a winter vacation, which is 75 employees. 20% of them take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which is 20 employees. So, the remaining 5 employees must have taken both a winter and a summer vacation. 

Now, we know that 40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which is 40 employees. Therefore, the number of employees who take a summer vacation is 40 + 5 = 45. 

So, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is (45 - 5)/100 = 40/100 = 40%. 

Therefore, the answer is Q = 40, which corresponds to choice (E). 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75% of them take a winter vacation, which is 75 employees. 20% of them take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which is 20 employees. Therefore, 5% of them take only a summer vacation, which is 5 employees. 

Now, let's assume that X percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. Then, we can create the following equation: 

40% = X% + 5% 

Solving for X, we get: 

X% = 40% - 5% = 35% 

Therefore, 35% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. 

Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 10
  C: 12
  D: 15
  E: 19
Response 0:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to prepare the cakes.
So, the number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 2 * x * 3 = 6x
And, the number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 35 * x * 3 = 105x
Now, we need to solve the following equations to find the value of x:
6x >= 20 (at least 20 large cakes are needed)
105x >= 700 (at least 700 small cakes are needed)
Solving these equations, we get x >= 4 and x >= 7 (rounded up to the nearest integer)
So, the minimum value of x that satisfies both equations is x = 7
Therefore, Answer("B") is the correct choice.
Response 1:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes.
So, the number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 2 * x * 3 = 6x
And, the number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 35 * x * 3 = 105x
Now, we need to solve the following equations to find the value of x:
6x >= 20 (at least 20 large cakes are needed)
105x >= 700 (at least 700 small cakes are needed)
Solving the above equations, we get:
x >= 10/3 (we need at least 10/3 helpers, but since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need at least 4 helpers)
x >= 20/3 (we need at least 20/3 helpers, but since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need at least 7 helpers)
Therefore, we need at least 7 helpers to make the required number of cakes.
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes. 

The time required to make 20 large cakes by x helpers can be calculated as 20/(2x) = 10/x hours. 

Similarly, the time required to make 700 small cakes by x helpers can be calculated as 700/(35x) = 20/x hours. 

Since the kitchen is available for 3 hours, we can set up the following equation to solve for x: 

10/x + 20/x <= 3 

Multiplying both sides by x, we get: 

10 + 20 <= 3x 

30 <= 3x 

x >= 10 

Therefore, we need at least 10 helpers to make the required number of cakes in the given time. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes.
So, the number of large cakes made by x helpers in 3 hours = 2 * x * 3 = 6x
And, the number of small cakes made by x helpers in 3 hours = 35 * x * 3 = 105x
Now, we need to solve the following equations to find the value of x:
6x >= 20 (as we need at least 20 large cakes)
105x >= 700 (as we need at least 700 small cakes)
3x <= 3 (as the kitchen is available for 3 hours)
Solving these equations, we get x >= 10/3 and x >= 20/3 and x <= 1
Therefore, the minimum value of x that satisfies all the equations is x = 4.
So, we need 4 helpers to make the required number of cakes.
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes.
So, the number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 2 * x * 3 = 6x
And, the number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 35 * x * 3 = 105x
We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
So, 6x >= 20  => x >= 20/6  => x >= 3.33 (approx)
And, 105x >= 700  => x >= 6.67 (approx)
Therefore, the minimum number of helpers required is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 6.67, which is 7.
Hence, Answer("None of the above") or Answer("7")
Response 5:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes.
So, the number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 2 * x * 3 = 6x
And, the number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 35 * x * 3 = 105x
Now, we need to solve the following equations to find the value of x:
6x >= 20 (as we need at least 20 large cakes)
105x >= 700 (as we need at least 700 small cakes)
Solving the above equations, we get:
x >= 10/3 (for large cakes)
x >= 20/3 (for small cakes)
So, the minimum value of x that satisfies both the equations is 20/3.
Therefore, we need at least 7 helpers to make the required number of cakes.
Answer: Answer("None of the above") [The closest answer is B: 10, but it is not the correct answer.]
Response 6:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes. 

The number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours is 2x*3 = 6x. 
The number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours is 35x*3 = 105x. 

We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. 

So, we have two equations: 

6x >= 20  (since we can only make whole cakes)
105x >= 700 

Solving for x: 

6x >= 20 
x >= 20/6 
x >= 3.33 

105x >= 700 
x >= 6.67 

Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to the nearest integer. 

Therefore, we need at least 7 helpers. 

Answer: Answer("None of the above") - The closest answer is option E (19), but it is not the correct answer.
Response 7:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes.
So, the number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 2 * x * 3 = 6x
And, the number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 35 * x * 3 = 105x
We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
So, 6x >= 20  => x >= 20/6  => x >= 10/3
And, 105x >= 700  => x >= 20/3
Therefore, the minimum number of helpers required is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 10/3, which is 4.
Hence, Answer("D") is the correct choice.
Response 8:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes.
So, the number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 2*x*3 = 6x
And, the number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 35*x*3 = 105x
We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
So, we can write two equations:
6x >= 20  (as we cannot make a fraction of a cake)
105x >= 700
Solving these equations, we get:
x >= 10/3
x >= 6.67 (approx.)
Therefore, we need at least 7 helpers to make the required number of cakes in the given time.
Answer: Answer("None of the above") (as none of the given options is equal to or greater than 7)
Response 9:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to prepare the cakes. 

The number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours is 2*x*3 = 6*x. 
The number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours is 35*x*3 = 105*x. 

We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. 

So, we need 20 large cakes - 6*x large cakes = (20-6x) large cakes to be made by the remaining helpers. 
We also need 700 small cakes - 105*x small cakes = (700-105x) small cakes to be made by the remaining helpers. 

We know that the remaining helpers can only make small cakes, so we can set up an equation: 

(700-105x)/35 = 20-6x 

Simplifying this equation: 

20x - 105x = -700/35 + 20 

-85x = -480/35 

x = 8.941 

Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to the nearest integer. 

Therefore, we need 9 helpers.

Question: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
Choices:
  A: 4,000
  B: 4,200
  C: 4,500
  D: 4,800
  E: 5,000
Response 0:
Let's assume that the factory produced x staplers on Monday. 

The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced = 90% of x = 0.9x

Out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 2% of 0.9x = 0.018x

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So, we can write:

0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the factory produced x staplers on Monday. 

The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced = 90% of x = 0.9x

Out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 2% of 0.9x = 0.018x

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So, we can set up the following equation:

0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the total number of staplers produced on Monday was "x". Then, the number of defective staplers produced is 0.1x and the number of non-defective staplers produced is 0.9x. 

Out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. This means that 0.02(0.9x) = 72. Solving for x, we get:

0.018x = 72
x = 4000

Therefore, the total number of staplers produced on Monday was 4000.

Response 5:
Let's assume that the total number of staplers produced on Monday was "x". 

The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced = 90% of x = 0.9x

Now, out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 2% of 0.9x = 0.018x

We are given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So, we can write:

0.018x = 72
x = 4000

Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Then, we know that:

P(A) = 0.6
P(A or B) = 0.96

Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Substituting the given values, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 

We know that P(at least one of A or B) = P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). 

Substituting the values we know, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 

We know that P(at least one of A or B) = P(A or B) = 0.96. This means that the probability of neither A nor B occurring is 1 - 0.96 = 0.04. 

We can express the probability of at least one of A or B occurring as: 

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) 

Substituting the values we know: 

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) 

Simplifying: 

0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) 

0.4P(B) = 0.36 

P(B) = 0.9 

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4 = 0.9

Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
Choices:
  A: 80
  B: 120
  C: 240
  D: 320
  E: 360
Response 0:
Let's start by finding out how many golf balls were sold. 

80% of 600 = 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls were sold.

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and all of the white golf balls were sold, then half of the 480 golf balls sold were white. 

So, 240 white golf balls were sold, which means that 240 yellow golf balls were sold as well. 

Therefore, the store had 360 yellow golf balls to begin the day.

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, half of the 480 sold were white golf balls. Therefore, 240 white golf balls were sold.

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the remaining 360 golf balls must be yellow.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let's assume that the store had y yellow golf balls and w white golf balls at the beginning of the day. We know that y + w = 600. 

We also know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, which means it sold 480 golf balls (0.8 x 600 = 480). Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it must have sold 240 of each. 

If the store sold all of its white golf balls, that means it had 0 white golf balls left at the end of the day. Therefore, it must have started with w - 240 = 0, which means w = 240. 

Substituting w = 240 into y + w = 600, we get y + 240 = 600, which means y = 360. 

Therefore, the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
Choices:
  A: $8
  B: $10
  C: $13.6
  D: $22.9
  E: $40
Response 0:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is:
x - 0.15x = 0.85x
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the new total cost is:
5(0.85x) + $300 = 0.85(5x) + $300 = $300 + $4.25x
This is $300 more than the original total cost of 5x, so we can write:
$300 + $4.25x = $5x
Solving for x, we get:
$0.75x = $300
x = $400
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:
0.85x = 0.85($400) = $340
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x.
Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so:
5(0.85x) = $300
4.25x = $300
x = $70
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:
0.85x = 0.85($70) = $59.5

Answer: Answer("None of the Above") - The closest answer is option D, but it is much higher than the correct answer. The correct answer is $59.5.
Response 2:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x.
Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so:
5(0.85x) = $300
4.25x = $300
x = $70
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:
0.85x = 0.85($70) = $59.50

Answer: Answer("None of the Above") - The new selling price of each article is not one of the available choices. The correct answer is $59.50.
Response 3:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x.
Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the new total cost is $300 + $5x.
We can set up an equation based on the given information:
$300 = 5(0.85x) + $5x
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$300 = $8.5x
x = $35
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x = 0.85($35) = $29.75, which is closest to choice D: $22.9.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x.
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so she spent $300 on (5+x) articles.
We can write this as:
300 = (5+x) * 0.85x
300 = 4.25x + 0.85x^2
0.85x^2 + 4.25x - 300 = 0
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we get:
x = 13.6 or x = -22.9
Since the price of each article cannot be negative, we choose x = 13.6 as the original price of each article.
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x = 0.85 * 13.6 = $11.56.

Answer: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x.
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so she spent $300 on (5+x) articles.
We can write this as:
300 = (5+x) * 0.85x
300 = 4.25x + 0.85x^2
0.85x^2 + 4.25x - 300 = 0
Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
x = 13.6 or x = -22.9
Since the price of each article cannot be negative, we choose x = 13.6 as the original price.
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x = 0.85 * 13.6 = $11.56, which is closest to choice C.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price of each article decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is (100% - 15%) * x = 0.85x.
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the new total cost is $300 + $300 = $600.
The new total cost is also equal to the new price of each article multiplied by the new number of articles, which is (0.85x) * (5 + 5) = 8.5x.
Therefore, 8.5x = $600, and x = $70.
The new price of each article is 0.85x = 0.85 * $70 = $59.5.
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") [The closest answer is $60, but it is not one of the available choices.]
Response 7:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After a 15% decrease, the new price of each article is (100% - 15%)x = 0.85x.
Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles is now $300 + $5x.
We can set up an equation: $300 + $5x = 0.85x * (5 + x)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$300 + $5x = 4.25x + 0.85x^2
0.85x^2 - 1.25x - $300 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
x = ($1.25 ± √($1.25^2 + 4*0.85*$300))/(2*0.85)
x ≈ $13.6
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is approximately $13.6.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x.
Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so:
5(0.85x) = $300
4.25x = $300
x = $70
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:
0.85x = 0.85($70) = $59.50

Answer: Answer("None of the Above") - The new selling price of each article is not one of the available choices.
Response 9:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x.
Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles decreased from 5x to 300.
Therefore, we can write the equation: 5x = (5 + 5) * 0.85x
Simplifying the equation, we get: 5x = 8.5x
Therefore, x = $60/3 = $20
The new selling price of each article is 0.85x = 0.85 * 20 = $17

Question: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 1120
  C: 792
  D: 1320
  E: 1200
Response 0:
Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively. 

When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is 24cm. 

24 = l/2 + b
=> l/2 = 24 - b

When folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the breadth of each part is 33cm.

33 = l + b/2
=> b/2 = 33 - l

Adding the above two equations, we get:

l/2 + b/2 = 57

Substituting the values of l/2 and b/2, we get:

24 - b + 33 - l = 57
=> l + b = 48

Now, we have two equations:

l/2 + b = 24
l + b/2 = 33

Solving these equations, we get:

l = 16, b = 32

Therefore, the area of the sheet = l * b = 16 * 32 = 512 sq.cm

Answer: Answer("None of the above") - The correct answer is not among the choices.
Response 1:
Let's assume the length of the rectangle is l and the breadth is b. 

When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is (48/2) - b = 24 - b. 

When folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the breadth of each part is (66/2) - l = 33 - l. 

Now, the area of the rectangle is l*b. 

We know that the length of each part when folded along the length is 24 - b. So, the total length of the rectangle is (24 - b) + (24 - b) = 48 - 2b. 

Similarly, the total breadth of the rectangle when folded along the breadth is 66 - 2l. 

We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2*(length + breadth). 

So, we have: 

2*(48 - 2b) = 48 => 96 - 4b = 48 => b = 12 

2*(66 - 2l) = 48 => 132 - 4l = 48 => l = 21 

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is l*b = 21*12 = 252 sq.cm. 

Action: Answer("None of the above") 

The correct answer is 252, which is not one of the given choices.
Response 2:
Let's assume the length of the rectangle is 'l' and the breadth is 'b'. 

When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is (48/2) - b = 24 - b. Therefore, the total length of both parts is 48 - 2b. 

When folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the breadth of each part is (66/2) - l = 33 - l. Therefore, the total breadth of both parts is 66 - 2l. 

We know that the area of the rectangle is given by A = lb. 

Now, we can write two equations using the above information: 

48 - 2b = 2(24 - b) + 2l  (equation 1)
66 - 2l = 2(33 - l) + 2b  (equation 2)

Simplifying equation 1, we get: 

48 - 2b = 48 - 2l + 2b
4b = 2l
2b = l

Substituting 2b = l in equation 2, we get: 

66 - 2l = 2(33 - l) + 4b
66 - 2(2b) = 2(33 - 2b) + 4b
66 - 4b = 66 - 4b
0 = 0

This means that our assumption 2b = l is correct. 

Substituting 2b = l in the equation for area, we get: 

A = lb = 2b * b = 2b^2

Now, we can substitute 2b = l in the equation for the total length of both parts: 

48 - 2b = 2(24 - b) + 2l
48 - 2b = 48 - 2b + 2b
0 = 0

This means that our assumption 2b = l is consistent with the given information. 

Finally, we can substitute 2b = l in the equation for the total breadth of both parts: 

66 - 2l = 2(33 - l) + 2b
66 - 4b = 66 - 2b
4b = 2b
2b = 0

This is not possible, so there must be an error in our calculations. 

Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Response 3:
Let's assume the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet are l and b respectively. 

When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is 24cm. Therefore, the new length of the sheet is l/2 + 24. 

When folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the breadth of each part is 33cm. Therefore, the new breadth of the sheet is b/2 + 33. 

The new length and breadth of the sheet are equal, as it is folded into two equal halves. So, 

l/2 + 24 = b/2 + 33 

l - b = 18 

Also, the perimeter of the original sheet is 2(l+b). 

2(l+b) = 48 + 66 

l+b = 57 

Solving these two equations, we get l = 37.5 and b = 19.5. 

Therefore, the area of the sheet is lb = 37.5 x 19.5 = 731.25 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively. 

When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is 24cm. Therefore, the length of the sheet is 2*24 = 48cm. 

When folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the breadth of each part is 33cm. Therefore, the breadth of the sheet is 2*33 = 66cm. 

Hence, the area of the sheet is l*b = 48*66 = 3168 sq.cm. 

Action: Answer("None of the above") 

The correct answer is not among the choices.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let's assume the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet are l and b respectively. 

When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is 24cm. Therefore, the new length becomes b+24 and the breadth remains the same i.e. l. 

When folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the breadth of each part is 33cm. Therefore, the new breadth becomes l+33 and the length remains the same i.e. b.

Now, we have two equations:
2(l+b+48) = 96 => l+b = 48-24 = 24
2(l+b+66) = 132 => l+b = 66-33 = 33

Solving these equations, we get l=9 and b=15.

Therefore, the area of the sheet = l*b = 9*15 = 135 sq.cm.

Question: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.
Choices:
  A: 2 miles
  B: 2.25 miles
  C: 3.25 miles
  D: 3.85 miles
  E: 2.85 miles
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. 21 minutes is equal to 0.35 hours (21/60 = 0.35). 

On a normal day, Bill can travel 15 miles in one hour. Therefore, in 0.35 hours, he can travel 15 x 0.35 = 5.25 miles. 

On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed is now 15 - 4 = 11 mph. 

Using this speed, we can calculate how far he can travel in 0.35 hours: 11 x 0.35 = 3.85 miles. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. 21 minutes is equal to 0.35 hours (21/60). 

On a normal day, Bill can travel 15 miles in an hour. Therefore, in 0.35 hours, he can travel 15 x 0.35 = 5.25 miles. 

On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. So, his speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph. 

In 0.35 hours, he can travel 11 x 0.35 = 3.85 miles.

Response 4:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. 

Action: Answer("E") 

21 minutes is equal to 0.35 hours (21/60 = 0.35). 

Next, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time 

On a normal day, Bill's rate is 15 mph. So on a windy day, his rate is 15 - 4 = 11 mph. 

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles 

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get 3.85 miles as the answer. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3.85 miles.

Response 1:
Let's start by finding the ratio of red sweets to green sweets in terms of a variable. Let x be the number of red sweets in the bag. Then we have:

red sweets : green sweets = 3 : 4

This can be written as:

x : 120 = 3 : 4

Cross-multiplying, we get:

4x = 360

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months = $554,400

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, we need to use the following formula:
Yearly profit = (Selling price per unit - Production cost per unit) x Number of units produced per year

We know the yearly profit and the production cost per unit, so we can rearrange the formula to solve for the selling price per unit:
Selling price per unit = (Yearly profit + Production cost per unit x Number of units produced per year) / Number of units produced per year

Substituting the values we know:
Selling price per unit = ($626,400 + $110 x 420 x 12) / (420 x 12) = $260

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $260.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months = $554,400

To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue from sales must be:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + $626,400 = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced in a year:
Minimum selling price per component = Yearly revenue / Number of components produced in a year
Number of components produced in a year = 420 units/month x 12 months = 5,040 units

Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months = $554,400

To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue from sales must be:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + $626,400 = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced in a year:
Minimum selling price per component = Yearly revenue / Number of components produced in a year
Number of components produced in a year = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units

Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Response 3:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months = $554,400

To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue from sales should be:
Yearly revenue = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced in a year:
Minimum selling price per component = Yearly revenue / Number of components produced in a year
Number of components produced in a year = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units

Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to use the following formula:
Yearly profit = (Selling price per unit - Production cost per unit) x Number of units produced per year

We know the yearly production cost is $554,400, and we want to find the minimum selling price per unit that will give us a yearly profit of at least $626,400. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the selling price per unit:
Selling price per unit = (Yearly profit + Production cost per unit x Number of units produced per year) / Number of units produced per year

Substituting the values we know:
Selling price per unit = ($626,400 + $110 x 420 x 12) / (420 x 12) = $260

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $260.

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, we need to use the following formula:
Yearly profit = (Selling price per unit - Production cost per unit) x Number of units per year

We know the yearly production cost is $554,400, and we want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400. So we can set up the equation as follows:
$626,400 = (Selling price per unit - $110) x 420 x 12

Simplifying the equation:
$626,400 = (Selling price per unit - $110) x 5,040
$626,400 / 5,040 = Selling price per unit - $110
$124 = Selling price per unit - $110
Selling price per unit = $234

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 62
  C: 82
  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Let's solve this problem using algebra. 

Let x be the first integer, then the sum of k consecutive integers is:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1)

We know that the least integer is -50, so x = -50. Substituting this value, we get:

-50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51

Simplifying the left side, we get:

k(-50) + (1+2+3+...+(k-1)) = 51

k(-50) + (k-1)k/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

2k(-50) + k(k-1) = 102

Simplifying and rearranging, we get a quadratic equation:

k^2 - 51k + 100 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

k = (51 ± sqrt(51^2 - 4*1*100))/2

k = (51 ± sqrt(2497))/2

k ≈ 50.2 or k ≈ 0.8

Since k has to be a positive integer, the only possible value is:

k = 51

Therefore, the answer is (none of the above).
Response 1:

k(-50) + (k-1)k/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

2k(-50) + k(k-1) = 102

Simplifying the right side, we get:

2k(-50) + k^2 - k = 102

Rearranging, we get:

k^2 - 2k - 152 = 0

We can factor this quadratic equation as:

(k-14)(k+12) = 0

So the possible values of k are k=14 and k=-12. However, k must be a positive integer since we are dealing with a sum of consecutive integers. Therefore, the only possible value of k is:

k = 14

Answer: Answer("A")

k(-50) + (k-1)k/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

2k(-50) + k(k-1) = 102

Simplifying and rearranging, we get a quadratic equation:

k^2 - 51k + 100 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

k = (51 ± sqrt(51^2 - 4*1*100))/2

k = (51 ± sqrt(2497))/2

k ≈ 50.2 or k ≈ 0.8

Since k has to be a positive integer, the only possible value is:

k = 51

k(-50) + (k-1)k/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

2k(-50) + k(k-1) = 102

Simplifying, we get:

k^2 - 49k + 102 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

k = (49 ± sqrt(49^2 - 4*102))/2
k = (49 ± sqrt(1681 - 408))/2
k = (49 ± sqrt(1273))/2

Since k must be a positive integer, we take the positive root:

k = (49 + sqrt(1273))/2

This is not an integer, so the answer is "None of the Above". However, we can approximate the answer using a calculator:

k ≈ 45.6

The closest integer to this value is 46, so the most likely answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above (closest is 46)")

We know that the least integer is -50, so x = -50. Substituting this value, we get:

-50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51

Simplifying the left side, we get:

k(-50) + (1+2+3+...+(k-1)) = 51

k(-50) + (k-1)k/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

2k(-50) + k(k-1) = 102

Simplifying, we get:

k^2 - 49k + 102 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

k = (49 ± sqrt(49^2 - 4*102))/2

k = (49 ± sqrt(1681 - 408))/2

k = (49 ± sqrt(1273))/2

k ≈ 3.6 or k ≈ 45.4

Since k has to be a positive integer, the only possible value is k = 45.

Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
Response 0:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. 

The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. We know that the area of a triangle is given by the formula (1/2) * base * height. Since the two triangles are congruent, their bases and heights are equal. Let's assume that the base and height of each triangle are b and h, respectively. Then we have:

(1/2) * b * h = 70

b * h = 140

Since the rectangular piece was cut diagonally in half to create two congruent triangles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal. We have:

diagonal^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2

diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16

diagonal = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)

Since the two triangles are congruent, each triangle has half the area of the rectangular piece. Therefore, we have:

(1/2) * (x-4) * x = 2 * 70

x^2 - 4x - 280 = 0

(x-20) * (x+14) = 0

x = 20 (since x cannot be negative)

Therefore, the original piece of cloth was a square with side length 20 feet. The perimeter of the square is 4 * 20 = 80 feet.

Answer: Action: Answer("None of the above") (The correct answer is 80, which is not one of the choices given)
Response 1:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. When this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, two right triangles are formed. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. 

We know that the area of a triangle is given by the formula (1/2) * base * height. In this case, the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. So, we have:

(1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get:

x = 14 or x = -10

Since the side of a square cannot be negative, we can discard the negative solution. Therefore, the original side of the square piece of cloth was 14 feet. 

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x = 4(14) = 56 feet.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. 

The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. We know that the area of a triangle is given by the formula (1/2) * base * height. Since the two triangles are congruent, their bases and heights are equal. Let's assume that the base and height of each triangle are b and h, respectively. Then we have:

(1/2) * b * h = 70

b * h = 140

Since the rectangular piece was cut diagonally in half to create two congruent triangles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal. We have:

diagonal^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2

diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16

diagonal = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)

Since the two triangles are congruent, each triangle has base b = diagonal/2 and height h = diagonal/2. Therefore, we have:

b^2 + h^2 = diagonal^2/4 + diagonal^2/4 = diagonal^2/2

Substituting the values of b and h, we get:

2b^2 = diagonal^2

2(diagonal/2)^2 = diagonal^2

diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16

Substituting this value of diagonal^2 in the above equation, we get:

2b^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16

b^2 = x^2 - 4x + 8

Substituting the value of b^2 from the above equation in the equation b*h = 140, we get:

b*(x-b) = 140

Substituting the value of b = diagonal/2, we get:

(diagonal/2)*(x-diagonal/2) = 140

Simplifying this equation, we get:

diagonal^2 - 2xdiagonal + 4x^2 - 560 = 0

Substituting the value of diagonal^2 from the earlier equation, we get:

2x^2 - 8x + 16 - 2x(sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)) + 4x^2 - 560 = 0

Simplifying this equation, we get:

6x^2 - 2x(sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)) - 544 = 0

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

3x^2 - x(sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)) - 272 = 0

Let's substitute y = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16). Then we have:

3x^2 - xy - 272 = 0

Solving for y, we get:

y = (x + sqrt(9x^2 + 272*4))/2

Since y = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16), we have:

2x^2 - 8x + 16 = (x + sqrt(9x^2 + 272*4))/2)^2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x^2 - 8x + 16 = (x + sqrt(9x^2 + 272*4))/2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

2x^2 - 16x + 32 = x + sqrt(9x^2 + 272*4)

Squaring both sides, we get:

4x^4 - 64x^3 + 416x^2 - 1088x + 1024 = 9x^2 + 272*4

Simplifying this equation, we get:

4x^4 - 64x^3 + 407x^2 - 1088x + 1024 = 0

We can factor this equation as:

(x-4)^2 * (4x^2 - 32x + 256) = 0

The only positive root of this equation is x = 4. Therefore, the original piece of cloth was a 4 ft by 4 ft square. The perimeter of this square is 4*4 = 16 feet.

Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, it creates two triangles, each with base (x-4) and height x. 

The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. Therefore, we have:

(1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get:

x = 14 or x = -10

Since the side of the square piece of cloth cannot be negative, we reject the solution x = -10. Therefore, the original side of the square piece of cloth was 14 feet.

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x = 4(14) = 56 feet.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, two triangles are formed. The area of each triangle is (1/2) * base * height. We know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. So, we can write:

(1/2) * (x-4) * x / 2 = 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

(x^2 - 4x) / 4 = 70

Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:

x^2 - 4x = 280

Rearranging, we get:

x^2 - 4x - 280 = 0

We can factor this quadratic equation as:

(x-20)(x+14) = 0

Since the side of the square cannot be negative, we take x = 20. Therefore, the original piece of cloth was a square with side 20 feet. The perimeter of this square is 4 * 20 = 80 feet. 

Answer: Answer("None of the above") 

The correct answer is not among the choices given. The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 80 feet.
Response 5:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, two right triangles are formed. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. 

We know that the area of a right triangle is given by the formula (1/2) * base * height. In this case, the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. So, we have:

(1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:

x = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 4*140)]/2
x = [4 ± sqrt(596)]/2
x = 2 ± sqrt(149)

Since x represents the length of one side of the original square piece of cloth, the perimeter of the original piece is 4x. So, we have:

Perimeter = 4x
Perimeter = 4(2 ± sqrt(149))
Perimeter = 8 ± 4sqrt(149)

Therefore, the answer is approximately 8 ± 19.36, which gives us a range of 27.36 to 46.64. The closest answer choice is  D: 62. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, we get two right triangles with legs (x-4) and x. 

The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. We know that the area of a right triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height. So, we can write:

(1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:

x = [4 ± sqrt(4^2 - 4*1*(-140))] / (2*1) = [4 ± sqrt(676)] / 2 = [4 ± 26] / 2

We can ignore the negative root, so we get:

x = 15 or x = 11

If we assume that x = 15, then the original perimeter of the square piece of cloth was 4x = 60 feet. If we assume that x = 11, then the original perimeter was 44 feet. 

Since we are looking for the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth, we need to choose the larger value, which is 60 feet.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let the original side of the square piece of cloth be x. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) by x. The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. 

Cutting the rectangular piece diagonally in half creates two congruent right triangles, each with legs x and (x-4) and area 70 square feet. 

The area of a right triangle is (1/2)base*height, so we have:

(1/2)x(x-4) = 70
x(x-4) = 140
x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0
(x-14)(x+10) = 0

Since x represents a length, we take the positive root x=14. Therefore, the original piece of cloth was a square with side length 14 feet, and its perimeter was 4*14 = 56 feet.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 8:

When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, two right triangles are formed. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. 

We know that the area of a triangle is given by the formula (1/2) * base * height. In this case, the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. So, 

(1/2) * base * height = 70
(1/2) * (x-4) * x/2 = 70
(x-4) * x/4 = 70
x^2 - 4x - 560 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation, we get x = 24 or x = -23. We can ignore the negative value of x. So, the original side of the square piece of cloth was 24 feet. 

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x = 4*24 = 96 feet. 

Therefore, 

Action: Answer("None of the above") 

The correct answer is not among the given choices. The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 96 feet.
Response 9:

(1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:

x = [4 ± sqrt(4^2 - 4*1*(-140))] / (2*1) = [4 ± sqrt(656)] / 2

We can discard the negative root, since x represents a length. So, we get:

x = [4 + sqrt(656)] / 2 = 18

Therefore, the original piece of cloth was a square with side length 18 feet. Its perimeter was 4 * 18 = 72 feet.

Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:
  A: 46
  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
Let's denote the length of the painted sides as x and y. We know that x + y + 9 = 37, which means x + y = 28. We also know that the area of the rectangle is given by A = xy. We can use the fact that (x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy to find xy as follows:

(x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy
(28)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy
784 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy

We can substitute x + y = 28 into the equation above to get:

784 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = (x + y)^2 = 28^2
x^2 + y^2 + 2xy - 784 = 0
(x - y)^2 = 784 - 4xy

We know that xy is the area of the rectangle, so we want to find xy. We also know that x + y = 28, so we can solve for y in terms of x:

y = 28 - x

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

(x - (28 - x))^2 = 784 - 4xy
(2x - 28)^2 = 784 - 4xy
4x^2 - 112x + 784 = 784 - 4xy
xy = x(28 - x)

We can substitute xy = x(28 - x) into the equation above to get:

4x^2 - 112x + 784 = 4x^2 - 4x^2 + 112x
224x = 784
x = 784/224 = 7/2

Substituting this into x + y = 28, we get:

y = 28 - x = 28 - 7/2 = 49/2

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is:

A = xy = (7/2)(49/2) = 171.5

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let's denote the length of the painted sides as x and y. We know that x + y + 9 = 37, which means x + y = 28. We also know that the area of the rectangle is given by A = xy. We can use the formula x + y = 28 to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. For example, we can solve for y by subtracting x from both sides: y = 28 - x. We can then substitute this expression for y into the formula for the area: A = x(28 - x) = 28x - x^2. This is a quadratic function that is maximized at x = 14 (the vertex of the parabola). Therefore, the maximum area of the rectangle is A = 14(28 - 14) = 196 square feet.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the length of the parking space is L and the width is W. We know that one of the sides (width) is unpainted, so the sum of the lengths of the other three sides (two lengths and one width) is 37 - 9 = 28 feet. Therefore, we have:

2L + W = 28
W = 9

Substituting W in the first equation, we get:

2L + 9 = 28
2L = 19
L = 9.5

So the area of the parking space is:

A = L x W = 9.5 x 9 = 85.5 square feet

Therefore, the closest answer is (A) 46. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's call the length of the painted side x and the width of the rectangle y. We know that y = 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we can write an equation:

2x + y = 37

Substituting y = 9, we get:

2x + 9 = 37

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 28

x = 14

So the length of the painted sides is 14 feet, and the width is 9 feet. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is:

A = x * y = 14 * 9 = 126 square feet

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's denote the length of the painted sides as l and w, where l is the length and w is the width of the rectangle. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so the length of the rectangle is l+9. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so 2l + w = 37 - 9 = 28. We can use these two equations to solve for l and w:
- l + 9 + l + w = 37 (substitute 2l+w=28 and simplify)
- 2l + w = 28
- 2l = 28 - w
- l = (28 - w)/2
Now we can substitute this expression for l into the area formula A = lw:
- A = w((28 - w)/2)
- A = (1/2)(28w - w^2)
- A = -1/2(w^2 - 28w)
The area is a quadratic function of w, which has a maximum value at w = -b/2a = -28/-2 = 14. Therefore, the maximum area is obtained when w = 14, and the corresponding length is l = (28 - 14)/2 = 7. The area is then A = lw = 7*14 = 98 square feet.
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let's denote the length of the painted sides as x and y. We know that x + y + 9 = 37, which means x + y = 28. We also know that the area of the rectangle is given by A = xy. We can use the fact that (x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy to find xy as follows:

(x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy
(28)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy
784 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy

We can substitute x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = 28^2 - 2(784 - xy) = 784 - 2(784 - xy) = 2xy - 784 to get:

A = xy = (784 - 2xy)(1/2)
2A = 784 - 2xy
2xy = 784 - 2A
xy = 392 - A

Now we can substitute x + y = 28 to get:

A = xy = (x + y)(28 - x - y)/2
A = (28x - x^2)/2 - xy + (28y - y^2)/2
A = (28x - x^2)/2 + (28y - y^2)/2 - (392 - A)
2A = 28x - x^2 + 28y - y^2 - 392
2A = (x + y)^2 - x^2 - y^2 - 392
2A = 28^2 - 2xy - 392
2A = 784 - 2xy - 392
2A = 392
A = 196

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 196 square feet.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let's call the length of the painted side x and the width of the parking space y. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9, so we can write an equation: 

2x + y = 37 (since there are two painted sides of length x)

We can also write an equation for the area of the rectangle: 

A = xy

We want to solve for A, so we need to find the values of x and y. We can rearrange the first equation to solve for y: 

y = 37 - 2x

Now we can substitute this expression for y into the equation for the area: 

A = x(37 - 2x)

Simplifying this expression: 

A = 37x - 2x^2

To find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to x and set it equal to 0: 

dA/dx = 37 - 4x = 0

Solving for x: 

x = 9.25

Now we can plug this value of x back into the equation for y: 

y = 37 - 2(9.25) = 18.5

So the dimensions of the parking space are 9.25 feet by 18.5 feet, and the area is: 

A = 9.25 * 18.5 = 171.125

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the answer is 171, which is not one of the choices. The closest answer is 126, so:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's denote the length of the painted sides as l and w, where l is the length and w is the width of the rectangle. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so the total length of the rectangle is l + 9. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so:

2l + w = 37

We can rearrange this equation to solve for w:

w = 37 - 2l

Now we can use the fact that the area of a rectangle is given by A = lw. Substituting our expression for w, we get:

A = l(37 - 2l)

Expanding this expression, we get:

A = 37l - 2l^2

To maximize the area, we need to find the value of l that maximizes this expression. We can do this by taking the derivative of A with respect to l and setting it equal to zero:

dA/dl = 37 - 4l = 0

Solving for l, we get:

l = 37/4

Substituting this value back into our expression for A, we get:

A = (37/4)(37/4 - 2(37/4)) = 81.5625

So the area of the parking space is approximately 81.56 square feet.

Answer: Answer("E") None of the above. The closest answer is B: 81.
Response 8:
Let's call the length of the painted side x and the width of the rectangle y. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9, so y = 9. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37, so 2x + y = 37. Substituting y = 9, we get 2x + 9 = 37, which gives us x = 14. 

Now we can find the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width: A = xy = 14 * 9 = 126. 

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C").
Response 9:
Let's assume that the length of the parking space is L and the width is W. We know that one of the sides (width) is not painted, so its length is 9 feet. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we can write an equation:

2L + W = 37 - 9
2L + W = 28

We also know that the area of a rectangle is A = L * W. We need to find the area, so we need to find the value of L and W. We can use the fact that W = 9 and substitute it into the equation above:

2L + 9 = 28
2L = 19
L = 9.5

Now we can find the area:

A = L * W
A = 9.5 * 9
A = 85.5

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 85.5 square feet.

Question: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 8
  C: 22
  D: 50
  E: 20
Response 0:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he completes (2/3)W of the yacht. 

The remaining portion of the work is (1/3)W. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means her rate of cleaning is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour. 

Let's represent the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work by the variable "t". 

We can set up the equation: 

(1/3)W = (1/240) * t * W 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

t = 8 

Therefore, it takes Jill 8 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of work is W/12. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he completes (2/3)W of the work. 

The remaining portion of the work is (1/3)W. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means her rate of work is (5/100) * (W/12) = W/240. 

Let's assume that Jill takes "x" hours to finish the remaining work. 

Using the work formula (work = rate x time), we can set up the following equation: 

(1/3)W = (W/240) * x 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

x = (1/3) * 240 

x = 80 

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his work rate is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the remaining one-third of the work is left for Jill to complete. 

Jill's work rate is 5% of Jack's work rate, which is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour. 

Let's represent the time taken by Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work by the variable "t". 

Using the work formula (work = rate x time), we can set up the following equation: 

(1/3)W = (1/240) * t * W 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

t = 80 

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to complete the remaining one-third of the work.

Response 3:

Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is W/12.

The remaining portion of the work is (1/3)W. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means her rate is (5/100) * (W/12) = W/240. 

Let's assume that Jill takes "x" hours to finish the remaining work. 

Using the formula: rate = work/time, we can set up the equation: 

W/240 = (1/3)W / x 

Solving for "x", we get: 

x = (1/3) * 240 = 80 

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work.

Jill's work rate is just 5% of what Jack can do, so her work rate is (5/100) * (W/12) = W/240. 

Let's assume that Jill takes "x" hours to finish the remaining work. 

Using the work formula (work = rate * time), we can set up the following equation: 

(1/3)W = (W/240) * x 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

x = (1/3) * 240 

x = 80 

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the entire work is equivalent to 12 units (since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours). If Jack completes two-thirds of the work, then he completes 8 units of work (12 * 2/3 = 8). The remaining work is 4 units (12 - 8 = 4). 

Since Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, then Jill's rate is 5% of 1 unit of work per hour, which is 0.05 units per hour. 

To find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we can use the formula: 

time = work / rate 

Substituting the values we have: 

time = 4 / 0.05 = 80 

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is W/12. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he completes (2/3)W of the work. 

The remaining portion of the work is (1/3)W. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means her rate is (5/100) * (W/12) = W/240. 

Let's use the formula: 

rate * time = work 

We know that Jack completes (2/3)W of the work, so: 

(W/12) * t = (2/3)W 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

t = 8 

This means that Jack takes 8 hours to complete two-thirds of the work. 

Now we need to find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining (1/3)W of the work. 

We know that Jill's rate is W/240, so: 

(W/240) * t = (1/3)W 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

t = 20 

Therefore, it takes Jill 20 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the remaining one-third of the work is left for Jill to complete. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. So, her rate of cleaning is 5/100 * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour. 

Let's assume that it takes Jill "x" hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work. 

Using the above information, we can create the following equation: 

(1/3) = (2/3) * (1/12) * (12) + (1/3) * (1/240) * (x)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

1/3 = 1/6 + x/7200

Multiplying both sides by 7200, we get: 

2400 = 1200 + x

Therefore, x = 1200, which means it takes Jill 1200 hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work. 

However, this answer seems unreasonable, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. 

Looking back at the equation, we can see that we made a mistake in the units of time. Instead of hours, we should have used minutes. 

So, the correct answer is: 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the work per hour. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he completes (2/3)W of the work. 

The remaining portion of the work is (1/3)W. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means her rate is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the work per hour. 

Let's assume that Jill takes "x" hours to finish the remaining work. 

Using the formula: rate = work/time, we can set up the equation: 

Jill's rate * x hours = (1/3)W 

Substituting the values we know: 

(1/240) * x = (1/3)W 

Multiplying both sides by 240: 

x = 80 

Therefore, Jill takes 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is W/12. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the remaining work is (1/3)W. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, her rate of cleaning is (5/100) * (W/12) = W/240. 

Let's assume that Jill takes "x" hours to finish the remaining work. Therefore, her rate of cleaning is (1/(x)) * (1/3)W. 

We know that the combined rate of cleaning of Jack and Jill is equal to the rate of cleaning of the entire yacht. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 

W/12 + (1/(x)) * (1/3)W = W/8 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

(1/(x)) * (1/3)W = W/24 

Solving for "x", we get: 

x = 8 

Therefore, it takes Jill 8 hours to finish the remaining work.

Response 9:
Let's assume the hundreds, tens, and units digits of the number are a, b, and c respectively. Then, we can form the following equations:
a + b + c = 17
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
Simplifying the third equation, we get:
99a - 99c = 495
a - c = 5
Now we can substitute a - c = 5 into the first equation to get:
2b + 5 = 17
b = 6
Substituting b = 6 into the first equation, we get:
a + c = 11
Now we can use trial and error to find the values of a and c that satisfy all three equations. We can start with a = 9 and c = 4, which gives b = 4. However, this does not satisfy the second equation. Trying a = 8 and c = 3, we get b = 6, which satisfies all three equations. Therefore, the number is 836, and subtracting 495 from it gives 341, which is the same as 143 written in reverse order.

Question: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 30
  C: 45
  D: 60
  E: 75
Response 0:
Let's assume the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. 

On Sunday, it buys twice as many newspapers as it does on Monday, which is 2x newspapers. 

For the rest of the days of the week (Tuesday to Saturday), it buys (1 * 5) = 5 newspapers each day. 

So the total number of newspapers bought in a week is: 

Sunday: 2x newspapers at $4 each = 8x dollars
Monday: x newspapers at $1 each = x dollars
Tuesday to Saturday: 5 newspapers each day at $1 each = 5 * 5 = 25 dollars

The total cost of newspapers per week is given as $210. So we can write an equation: 

8x + x + 25 = 210 

Simplifying the equation: 

9x = 185 

x = 20.55 

Since the hotel cannot buy a fraction of a newspaper, it must buy 20 newspapers on Monday. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. 

According to the problem, the hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week. Therefore, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. 

The hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday, and each newspaper costs $4. Therefore, the hotel spends 2x * $4 = $8x on Sunday newspapers. 

The hotel buys x newspapers on Monday through Saturday, and each newspaper costs $1. Therefore, the hotel spends 6x * $1 = $6x on newspapers from Monday through Saturday. 

The hotel spends a total of $210 per week on newspapers. Therefore, we can write an equation: 

$8x + $6x = $210 

Simplifying the equation: 

$14x = $210 

x = $210 / $14 

x = 15 

Therefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Then, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. The hotel buys (7-1)=6 newspapers on the rest of the days of the week. 

The total cost of buying newspapers for a week is $210. Therefore, we can write the equation:

2x($4) + 6($1)x + 1($4)(2x) = $210

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x + 6x + 8x = 210
22x = 210
x = 9.54

Since the hotel cannot buy a fraction of a newspaper, it must buy 10 newspapers on Monday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Then, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. And, it buys 1 newspaper each day from Tuesday to Saturday. Therefore, the total number of newspapers bought in a week is:

2x (Sunday) + x (Monday) + 5 (Tuesday to Saturday) = 7x + 5

The total cost of buying these newspapers is $210. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

4(2x) + 1(x) + 5(1) = 210
8x + x + 5 = 210
9x = 205
x = 22.78

Since the hotel cannot buy a fraction of a newspaper, it must buy 23 newspapers on Monday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Then, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. And, it buys 1 newspaper each day for the rest of the week (i.e., 5 days). Therefore, the total number of newspapers bought in a week is:

2x (Sunday) + x (Monday) + 5 (rest of the week) = 7x + 5

We know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

4(2x) + 1(x) + 1(5) = 210
Simplifying the equation, we get:

9x = 201
x = 22.33

Since the hotel cannot buy a fraction of a newspaper, we can round x up to the nearest whole number, which is 23. Therefore, the hotel buys 23 newspapers on Monday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Then, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. And, it buys 1 newspaper on each of the remaining 5 days of the week. 

The total cost of buying newspapers for a week is $210. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

2(4) x + 5(1) x = 210

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

8x + 5x = 210

13x = 210

x = 16.15 (approx)

Since the hotel cannot buy a fraction of a newspaper, we can round up the value of x to the nearest integer. Therefore, the hotel buys 17 newspapers on Monday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Then, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. The hotel buys (7-1) = 6 newspapers for the rest of the days of the week. 

The total cost of the newspapers per week is $210. Therefore, we can write the equation:

2x($4) + 6($1)x + 1($4) = $210

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x + 6x + 4 = 210
14x = 206
x ≈ 14.71

Therefore, the hotel buys approximately 14.71 newspapers on Monday. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Then, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. And, it buys 1 newspaper each day from Tuesday to Saturday.

2(4) + 1(x + x + 5) = 210

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + 2x + 5 = 210
2x = 197
x = 98.5

Since the hotel cannot buy half a newspaper, we can round up the value of x to the nearest integer. Therefore, the hotel buys 99 newspapers on Monday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:

We know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

4(2x) + 1(x) + 1(5) = 210
8x + x + 5 = 210

= 2x + 6

The total cost of buying these newspapers is $210. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

4(2x) + 1(5) = 210

Simplifying this equation, we get:

8x + 5 = 210

8x = 205

x = 25.625

Since the hotel cannot buy a fraction of a newspaper, we can round up x to the nearest integer, which is 26. Therefore, the hotel buys 26 newspapers on Monday.

Question: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
Choices:
  A: 144km
  B: 72 km
  C: 126km
  D: 84 km
  E: 48km
Response 0:
Let's call the distance between X and Y as "d". 

When Allen and Bob meet for the first time, they have covered a total distance of "d". Let's call the distance covered by Allen until this point as "x". Therefore, the distance covered by Bob until this point is "d-x". 

Now, Allen has to cover the remaining distance from Y to X, which is also "d-x". Since Allen's speed is 54 kmph, the time taken by Allen to cover this distance is (d-x)/54. 

At the same time, Bob has to cover the remaining distance from X to Y, which is also "d-x". Since Bob's speed is 78 kmph, the time taken by Bob to cover this distance is (d-x)/78. 

We know that they meet for the second time after Allen has covered the distance "d-x" and Bob has covered the distance "d-x+48". We also know that they cover these distances in the times (d-x)/54 and (d-x+48)/78, respectively. 

Since they cover the same distance, we can set up the equation: 

(d-x)/54 = (d-x+48)/78 

Solving for "x", we get x = 36. 

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is: 

d = 2x = 72 km 

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken for Allen to reach Y be t hours. Then, the time taken for Bob to reach X is also t hours. 

Distance travelled by Allen in t hours = 54t km
Distance travelled by Bob in t hours = 78t km

When they meet for the first time, the total distance travelled by both of them is d km. Therefore, we can write:

54t + 78t = d

When they meet for the second time, the total distance travelled by both of them is 2d km. At this point, Allen has travelled a total distance of 2d km, while Bob has travelled a total distance of 2d + 48 km. Therefore, we can write:

2d = 54t + (2d + 48 - 78t)
Simplifying this equation, we get:

132t = 2d + 48
66t = d + 24

Substituting the value of d from the first equation, we get:

66t = 54t + 48
12t = 48
t = 4

Substituting the value of t in the first equation, we get:

54t + 78t = d
54(4) + 78(4) = d
d = 504/8 = 63

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 63 km.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken by Allen to reach Y be t hours. Then, the time taken by Bob to reach X is also t hours. 

Distance covered by Allen in t hours = 54t km
Distance covered by Bob in t hours = 78t km

When they meet for the first time, the total distance covered by both of them is d km. 
So, 54t + 78t = d  (Equation 1)

When they meet for the second time, the total distance covered by both of them is 2d km. 
Distance covered by Allen in 2t hours = 2*54t = 108t km
Distance covered by Bob in 2t hours = 2*78t = 156t km

Given that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen when they meet for the second time. 
So, 156t - 108t = d + 48
48t = d + 48  (Equation 2)

Substituting Equation 2 in Equation 1, we get:
54t + 78t = 48t + 48
84t = 48
t = 0.57 hours

Substituting t in Equation 1, we get:
54t + 78t = d
54*0.57 + 78*0.57 = d
d = 72 km

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 72 km.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken by Allen to reach Y be t hours. Then, the time taken by Bob to reach X is also t hours. 

Distance travelled by Allen in t hours = 54t km
Distance travelled by Bob in t hours = 78t km

When they meet for the first time, the total distance travelled by both of them is d km. 
So, 54t + 78t = d  => 132t = d

When they meet for the second time, the total distance travelled by both of them is 2d km. 
Distance travelled by Allen in 2t hours = 2*54t = 108t km
Distance travelled by Bob in 2t hours = 2*78t = 156t km

Given that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen when they meet for the second time. 
So, 156t - 108t = 48  => 48t = 48  => t = 1

Therefore, d = 132t = 132*1 = 132 km

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's call the distance between X and Y as "d". 

When they meet for the first time, let's say they have both traveled "x" km from their starting points. At this point, Allen has traveled from X to Y and back for a total of 2x km, while Bob has traveled from Y to X for a total of x km. 

We know that their combined distance is equal to the distance between X and Y: 

2x + x = d 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

x = d/3 

Now, let's find out how far they travel before they meet for the second time. 

In the time it takes Allen to travel from Y to X and back, Bob travels a distance that is 48 km more than Allen's total distance. 

Let's call the distance Allen travels from Y to X and back as "y". 

So, Bob travels a distance of: 

y + 48 km 

We know that: 

distance = speed x time 

Therefore, we can write: 

y = (54 kmph) x (time taken by Allen to travel from Y to X and back) 

y + 48 = (78 kmph) x (time taken by Bob to travel from X to Y and back) 

We can also write the time taken by Allen and Bob in terms of the distance they travel: 

time taken by Allen = (y/54) + (y/54) = (2y/54) = (y/27) 

time taken by Bob = [(d-y)/78] + [(d-y)/78] = [(2d-2y)/78] = [(d-y)/39] 

Now, we can set up an equation using the information we have: 

y + 48 = (78/27) x y 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

y = 432/7 

Now, we can substitute this value of y in the equation we derived earlier: 

d/3 + d/3 = 432/7 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

d = 126 km 

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 126 km. 

Answer: Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken by both Allen and Bob to meet for the first time be t hours. Then, we have:

Distance covered by Allen in t hours = 54t
Distance covered by Bob in t hours = 78t

When they meet for the first time, the total distance covered by both of them is d. Therefore, we have:

54t + 78t = d

Simplifying this equation, we get:

132t = d

Now, let's consider the time taken by both of them to meet for the second time. Let's say they meet after x hours. Then, we have:

Distance covered by Allen in x hours = 54x
Distance covered by Bob in x hours = 78x

When they meet for the second time, the distance covered by Allen is the same as the distance covered by Bob plus 48 km. Therefore, we have:

54x = 78x + 48

Simplifying this equation, we get:

24x = 48

x = 2

So, they meet for the second time after 2 hours. In these 2 hours, Allen covers a distance of 54 x 2 = 108 km. Therefore, the distance between X and Y is:

d = 132t = 132 x (108/54) = 264 km

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let's assume the distance between X and Y is d km. 

When they meet for the first time, let's say they have both traveled x km. 
At this point, Allen has traveled from X to Y and back for a total of 2x km. 
Bob has traveled from Y to X for a total of x km. 

Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can write:

2x = (54 kmph) * t1   and   x = (78 kmph) * t1

where t1 is the time taken for them to meet for the first time. 

Solving for t1, we get:

t1 = x / 78 = 2x / (54 + 78)

Now, when they meet for the second time, let's say they have both traveled y km. 
At this point, Allen has traveled from X to Y and back for a total of 2y km. 
Bob has traveled from Y to X and back for a total of 2(x + 48) km (since he has covered 48 km more than Allen). 

Using the same formula as before, we can write:

2y = (54 kmph) * t2   and   2(x + 48) = (78 kmph) * t2

where t2 is the time taken for them to meet for the second time. 

Solving for t2, we get:

t2 = (x + 24) / 39 = (2x + 96) / (54 + 78)

Now, since they meet at Y for the first time, we know that:

2x = d

And since they meet at X for the second time, we know that:

2(x + 48) = d

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

2(d/2 + 48) = d

Simplifying, we get:

d = 144 km

Therefore, the answer is A: 144km.
Response 7:
Let's assume that the distance between X and Y is d km. 

When Allen and Bob meet for the first time, let's say they have both traveled x km. At this point, Allen has covered half the distance between X and Y, and Bob has covered the other half. 

Time taken by Allen to travel x km = x/54 hours
Time taken by Bob to travel x km = x/78 hours

Since they both started at the same time, we can equate their travel times and solve for x:

x/54 = (d - x)/78
78x = 54(d - x)
132x = 54d
x = 27d/66

Now, when they meet for the second time, Allen would have traveled a total distance of (d + x) km, and Bob would have traveled a total distance of (d + 48 + d - x) km (since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen). 

Time taken by Allen to travel (d + x) km = (d + x)/54 hours
Time taken by Bob to travel (d + 48 + d - x) km = (2d + 48 - x)/78 hours

Again, we can equate their travel times and solve for x:

(d + x)/54 = (2d + 48 - x)/78
78(d + x) = 54(2d + 48 - x)
78d + 78x = 108d + 2592 - 54x
132x = 30d + 2592
22x = 5d + 432

We can substitute the value of x we obtained earlier:

22(27d/66) = 5d + 432
297d = 330d + 7128
33d = 7128
d = 216

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 216 km.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's call the distance between X and Y as "d". 

When they first meet, let's say they meet at point "M". At this point, Allen has traveled a distance of "x" from X to M, and Bob has traveled a distance of "d-x" from Y to M. 

We know that they meet for the second time when Allen has traveled a distance of "2d" (going from X to Y and then back to X) and Bob has traveled a distance of "2d+48" (going from Y to X and then back to Y, and covering an additional 48 km). 

We can set up an equation using the formula: distance = speed x time. 

For Allen: 
distance = speed x time
2d = 54 x t1 (where t1 is the time taken for Allen to travel 2d) 

For Bob: 
distance = speed x time
2d + 48 = 78 x t2 (where t2 is the time taken for Bob to travel 2d+48) 

We can rearrange the first equation to get: 
t1 = (2d)/54 

We can rearrange the second equation to get: 
t2 = (2d+48)/78 

Since they both meet at point M for the second time, we know that they have traveled for the same amount of time. Therefore: 
t1 = t2 

We can substitute the values of t1 and t2 in terms of "d" into the equation above and solve for "d": 

(2d)/54 = (2d+48)/78 

Solving for "d", we get: 
d = 126 

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 126 km. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken by both Allen and Bob to meet for the first time be t hours. At the time of their first meeting, Allen would have traveled a distance of 54t km and Bob would have traveled a distance of 78t km. Since they meet each other, the sum of the distances traveled by both of them should be equal to d km. Therefore, we have:

54t + 78t = d

132t = d

t = d/132

At the time of their second meeting, Allen would have traveled a distance of 54t + 48 km (since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen) and Bob would have traveled a distance of 78t - 48 km (since he has to travel back 48 km from X to meet Allen for the second time). Since they meet each other at this point, the sum of the distances traveled by both of them should be equal to d km. Therefore, we have:

54t + 78t - 48 = d

132t = d + 48

Substituting the value of t from the first equation, we get:

132(d/132) = d + 48

d = 144 km

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 144 km.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
Response 0:
Solution:
Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.
Let's also assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is "s" km/hr.
According to the problem, 
During the forward journey, the jeep travelled a distance "d" km in 6 hours at a speed of "s" km/hr.
Therefore, d = 6s.  --- (Equation 1)
During the return journey, the jeep travelled the same distance "d" km in 4 hours at a speed of (s+12) km/hr.
Therefore, d = 4(s+12).  --- (Equation 2)
We can solve the above two equations to find the value of "d".
From Equation 1, s = d/6.
Substituting the value of s in Equation 2, we get
d = 4(d/6 + 12)
d = 4d/6 + 48
2d/3 = 48
d = 72*3/2
d = 108 km.

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 108 km.

Action: Answer("None of the above")  # The correct answer is not in the given choices.
Response 1:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep as "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

During the forward journey, 

time taken = 6 hours

distance travelled = d km

speed = s km/hr

Therefore, 

d = s x 6  ----(1)

During the return journey, 

time taken = 4 hours

distance travelled = d km

speed = (s + 12) km/hr

Therefore, 

d = (s + 12) x 4  ----(2)

From equations (1) and (2), we can say that 

s x 6 = (s + 12) x 4

6s = 4s + 48

2s = 48

s = 24 km/hr

Substituting the value of s in equation (1), we get 

d = 24 x 6 = 144 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Solution:
Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.
Let's also assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is "s" km/hr.
According to the problem, 
During the forward journey, the jeep travelled a distance of "d" km in 6 hours at a speed of "s" km/hr.
Therefore, d = 6s  --- (Equation 1)
During the return journey, the jeep travelled the same distance "d" km in 4 hours at a speed of (s+12) km/hr.
Therefore, d = 4(s+12)  --- (Equation 2)
Now, we can solve for "d" by equating Equation 1 and Equation 2 as follows:
6s = 4(s+12)
Solving for "s", we get s = 18km/hr
Substituting s = 18km/hr in Equation 1, we get d = 6s = 6(18) = 108km
Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 108km.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep as "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

Speed = Distance / Time

During the forward journey, 

s = d/6

During the return journey, 

s+12 = d/4

We need to find the value of "d".

Let's solve the above two equations to find the value of "d".

d/6 + 12 = d/4

Multiplying both sides by 12, we get:

2d + 144 = 3d

d = 144 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

d = s x 6  (since distance = speed x time for the forward journey)

d = (s + 12) x 4  (since distance = speed x time for the return journey)

Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for "d" by equating the two equations.

s x 6 = (s + 12) x 4

6s = 4s + 48

2s = 48

s = 24

Substituting s = 24 in any of the two equations, we get:

d = s x 6 = 24 x 6 = 144

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144km.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep as "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

Speed = Distance / Time

During the forward journey, 

s = d/6

During the return journey, 

s+12 = d/4

We need to find the value of "d".

We can solve the above two equations to get the value of "d".

d/6 + 12 = d/4

Multiplying both sides by 12, we get

2d + 144 = 3d

d = 144 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep as "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

Speed = Distance / Time

During the forward journey, the jeep took 6 hours to travel "d" km at a speed of "s" km/hr. Therefore, 

s = d/6

During the return journey, the jeep increased its speed by 12km/hr. Therefore, the speed of the jeep during the return journey was (s+12) km/hr. The time taken during the return journey was 4 hours. Therefore, 

s+12 = d/4

We can solve these two equations to find the values of "s" and "d". 

s = d/6

s+12 = d/4

Substituting the value of "s" from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

d/6 + 12 = d/4

Multiplying both sides by 12, we get:

2d + 144 = 3d

d = 144 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Solution:
Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.
Let's also assume the speed of the jeep during the forward journey is "s" km/hr.
According to the problem, during the return journey, the jeep increased its speed by 12km/hr. Therefore, the speed of the jeep during the return journey is "s+12" km/hr.
We know that distance = speed x time.
Using this formula, we can write two equations based on the information given in the problem:
Equation 1: d = s x 6  (since the jeep took 6 hours during the forward journey)
Equation 2: d = (s+12) x 4  (since the jeep took 4 hours during the return journey)
We can solve these equations to find the value of "d".
Equating both equations, we get:
s x 6 = (s+12) x 4
6s = 4s + 48
2s = 48
s = 24
Substituting the value of "s" in Equation 1, we get:
d = 24 x 6 = 144
Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144km.
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Solution:
Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.
Let's also assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is "s" km/hr.

Forward journey time = 6 hours
Return journey time = 4 hours
During the return journey, the speed of the jeep increased by 12km/hr. Therefore, the speed of the jeep in the return journey is (s+12) km/hr.
We know that speed = distance/time. Using this formula, we can write two equations as follows:
s = d/6  (since the forward journey time is 6 hours)
s+12 = d/4  (since the return journey time is 4 hours and the speed of the jeep increased by 12km/hr)
We can solve these two equations to find the value of "d" as follows:
d/6 + 12 = d/4
Multiplying both sides by 12 gives:
2d + 144 = 3d
Therefore, d = 144 km
Answer: Answer("B") 
Response 9:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep as "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

During the forward journey, 

Time taken = 6 hours

Distance travelled = d km

Speed = s km/hr

Therefore, 

d = s x 6  ----(1)

During the return journey, 

Time taken = 4 hours

Distance travelled = d km

Speed = (s + 12) km/hr

Therefore, 

d = (s + 12) x 4  ----(2)

From equations (1) and (2), we get

s x 6 = (s + 12) x 4

6s = 4s + 48

2s = 48

s = 24 km/hr

Substituting the value of s in equation (1), we get

d = 24 x 6 = 144 km

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 28
  C: 30
  D: 53
  E: 59
Response 0:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula: N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/k), where N(t) is the number of water lilies at time t, N0 is the initial number of water lilies, k is the doubling time, and t is the time elapsed.

We know that N(60) = 2^30, since the number of water lilies doubles every two days for 60 days. We also know that N(0) = 64, since initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake. 

To find the doubling time k, we can use the formula: 2^k = 2, which gives us k = 1. 

Now we can solve for t: 

N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/k)
N(t) = 64 * 2^(t/1)
N(t) = 64 * 2^t

We want to find the time t when N(t) = 2^30, so we can set up the equation:

2^30 = 64 * 2^t

Dividing both sides by 64, we get:

2^26 = 2^t

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get:

26 = t

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 26 days, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") - The correct answer is not among the choices.
Response 1:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula. If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of water lilies after t days can be represented as 2^(t/2). 

We know that if there is one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days to be fully covered with water lilies. So, we can set up the equation as follows:

2^(60/2) = 2^30 = N, where N is the number of water lilies when the lake is fully covered.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it. So, we need to solve for t in the following equation:

2^(t/2) = 64 * 2^30

2^(t/2) = 2^(6 + 30)

2^(t/2) = 2^36

t/2 = 36

t = 72

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 72 days if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula. If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of water lilies after t days can be represented as 2^(t/2). 

We know that if there is one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days to be fully covered with water lilies. So, we can set up the equation as follows:

2^(60/2) = 2^30 = N, where N is the total number of water lilies on the lake.

We can solve for N as follows:

N = 1 * 2^30

Now, let's find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

2^x = 64 * 2^30

2^x = 2^6 * 2^30

2^x = 2^36

x = 36

Therefore, it will take 36 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula: N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/k), where N(t) is the number of water lilies at time t, N0 is the initial number of water lilies, k is the doubling time, and t is the time elapsed. 

We know that when t=60, N(60) = 2^30. Therefore, we can solve for k as follows: 

2^30 = 1 * 2^(60/k)
2^30 = 2^(60/k)
30 = 60/k
k = 2

Now we can use the formula again to find the time it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies when N0=64: 

N(t) = 64 * 2^(t/2)

We want to find t such that N(t) = 2^30. 

2^30 = 64 * 2^(t/2)
2^25 = 2^(t/2)
25 = t/2
t = 50

Therefore, the answer is 50 days. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula. If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of water lilies after t days can be represented as 2^(t/2). 

We know that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies when there is one water lily initially. So, we can set up the following equation:

2^(60/2) = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824

This means that there will be 1,073,741,824 water lilies on the lake after 60 days when there is one water lily initially.

Now, let's find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if initially there were 64 water lilies on it. We can set up the following equation:

2^(t/2) = 1,073,741,824/64 = 16,777,216

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

t/2 = log2(16,777,216)
t/2 = 24

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

t = 48

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 48 days if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

We know that k = 2 days and N(60) = 2^30. We need to find t such that N(t) = 64. 

N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/k) = 64
1 * 2^(t/2) = 64
2^(t/2) = 2^6
t/2 = 6
t = 12

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 12 + 2 = 14 days. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula: N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/k), where N(t) is the number of water lilies at time t, N0 is the initial number of water lilies, t is the time elapsed, and k is the doubling time. We know that k = 2 days, and N(60) = 2^30. We need to find t such that N(t) = 64. 

N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/k) = 64
1 * 2^(t/2) = 64
2^(t/2) = 2^6
t/2 = 6
t = 12

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 12 + 2 = 14 days.

We know that N(60) = 2^30, since the number of water lilies doubles every two days for 60 days. We also know that N(0) = 64, since initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake. 

To find the doubling time k, we can use the formula: 2^k = 2, which gives us k = 1. 

Now we can solve for t when N(t) = 2^36 (since there are 64*2^6 = 2^36 water lilies after 6 doubling times): 

2^36 = 64 * 2^(t/1)
2^36 = 64 * 2^t
2^36/64 = 2^t
2^(36-6) = 2^t
2^30 = 2^t
t = 30

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 30 days if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula: N = N0 * 2^(t/k), where N is the final number of water lilies, N0 is the initial number of water lilies, t is the time it takes for the number of water lilies to double, and k is a constant. We need to find t when N0 = 64 and N = the maximum number of water lilies that can cover the lake. We know that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies when N0 = 1. Therefore, we can find k as follows: 60 = t/k, which means k = t/60. Now we can substitute N0 = 64, N = the maximum number of water lilies, and k = t/60 into the formula and solve for t:

N = N0 * 2^(t/k)
Maximum number of water lilies = 64 * 2^(t/(60t))
2^(t/60) = (Maximum number of water lilies)/64
t/60 = log2((Maximum number of water lilies)/64)
t = 60 * log2((Maximum number of water lilies)/64)

We want to find t when the maximum number of water lilies covers the lake, which means N = the area of the lake. Let's assume the area of the lake is A. We know that the lake is fully covered with water lilies when the total area covered by the water lilies is equal to A. The area covered by the water lilies doubles every two days, which means that after t days, the area covered by the water lilies is A = A0 * 2^(t/2k), where A0 is the initial area covered by the water lilies. We know that A0 = 1 when N0 = 1, and A0 = 64 when N0 = 64. Therefore, we can write:

A = 1 * 2^(t/2k) when N0 = 1
A = 64 * 2^(t/2k) when N0 = 64

We want to find t when A = the area of the lake. Let's assume the area of the lake is L. We can write:

L = A = 1 * 2^(t/2k) when N0 = 1
L = A = 64 * 2^(t/2k) when N0 = 64

Now we can solve for t using the formula we derived earlier:

t = 60 * log2((Maximum number of water lilies)/64)

When N0 = 1, the maximum number of water lilies is A = L, so we have:

t = 60 * log2(L/64)

When N0 = 64, the maximum number of water lilies is A = 64L, so we have:

t = 60 * log2(64L/64) = 60 * log2(L)

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D") 53
Response 9:
Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies will double to reach the final number of lilies. 

Initially, there are 64 lilies, and to reach the final number, the number of lilies needs to double 5 times (since $2^5 = 32$ and $64 \cdot 32 = 2048$). 

Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, it will double 5 times in 10 days (2 days for the first doubling, 2 more days for the second doubling, and so on). 

Therefore, if initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake, it will take 60 - 10 = 50 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.

Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Let the share of each nephew be x. Then, the share of each daughter is 4x and the share of each son is 5x.

The total number of people who receive a share is 5+4+2=11.

Therefore, we have 5x+4(4x)+2x=8600
Simplifying the above equation, we get 23x=8600
Thus, x= 8600/23

Therefore, the share of each daughter is 4x = 4*(8600/23) = Rs 1478.26 (approx)

Answer: Option None of the Above (approx Rs 1478.26)
Response 1:
Let the share of each nephew be x. Then, the share of each daughter is 4x and the share of each son is 5x.

The total number of people who receive a share is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.

Therefore, we have:

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600

Simplifying this equation, we get:

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600

43x = 8600

x = 200

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let the share of each nephew be x. Then, the share of each daughter is 4x and the share of each son is 5x.

The total number of people who receive a share is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.

Therefore, we have:

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600

Simplifying this equation, we get:

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600

43x = 8600

x = 200

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each daughter = 4x and the share of each son = 5x.
Total number of shares = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
Total amount = Rs 8600
So, x = 8600/11
Hence, the share of each daughter = 4x = 4*(8600/11) = Rs 3127.27 (approx)
Therefore, the answer is: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Let the share of each nephew be x. Then, the share of each daughter is 4x and the share of each son is 5x. 

Total number of people = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11

Total amount = Rs 8600

So, we have the equation: 

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600

Simplifying this equation, we get:

31x = 8600

x = 278.71 (approx)

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = Rs 1114.84 (approx)

Answer: Answer("None of the above") - Rs 1100
Response 5:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each daughter = 4x and the share of each son = 5x.
Total number of shares = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
Total amount = Rs 8600

Response 8:
Let the share of each nephew be x. Then, the share of each daughter is 4x and the share of each son is 5x.

The total number of people who receive a share is 5+4+2 = 11.

Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75 employees take a winter vacation, 40 employees take both a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. 

Therefore, the number of employees who take at least one vacation is 100 - 20 = 80. 

We can find the number of employees who take only a summer vacation by subtracting the number of employees who take both vacations from the total number of employees who take a summer vacation: 

Number of employees who take only a summer vacation = Total number of employees who take a summer vacation - Number of employees who take both vacations
Number of employees who take only a summer vacation = (Q/100) x 100 - 40
Number of employees who take only a summer vacation = Q - 40

We know that 75 employees take a winter vacation, and 40 employees take both vacations. Therefore, the number of employees who take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation is:

Number of employees who take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation = 75 - 40 = 35

We also know that 20 employees take neither vacation. Therefore, the number of employees who take no winter vacation but take a summer vacation is:

Number of employees who take no winter vacation but take a summer vacation = Total number of employees who take a summer vacation - Number of employees who take both vacations - Number of employees who take only a winter vacation - Number of employees who take neither vacation
Number of employees who take no winter vacation but take a summer vacation = (Q/100) x 100 - 40 - 35 - 20
Number of employees who take no winter vacation but take a summer vacation = Q - 95

We want to find Q such that the number of employees who take no winter vacation but take a summer vacation is equal to the number of employees who take only a summer vacation:

Q - 95 = Q - 40
55 = Q

Therefore, the answer is Q = 55, which corresponds to choice D: 35%.
Response 1:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. 

Given that 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, 25% do not take a winter vacation. 

Out of these 25%, 20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. So, 5% of the employees take only a summer vacation or both a summer and winter vacation. 

Now, we know that 40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation. So, out of the remaining 75% (who take a winter vacation), 40% take a summer vacation as well. This means that 35% of the employees take both a winter and summer vacation. 

Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is:
35% (take both) - 5% (take both or only summer) = 30%

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. 

If 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, then 25% of the employees do not take a winter vacation. 

If 40% take a winter and a summer vacation, then 35% of the employees take only a summer vacation. 

If 20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, then 80% of the employees take at least one of these vacations. 

Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is:

35% (take only a summer vacation) - 25% (do not take a winter vacation) = 10%

Answer: Answer("A") 5%
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75% of them take a winter vacation, which is 75 employees. 20% of them take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which is 20 employees. Therefore, 100 - 75 - 20 = 5 employees take only a winter vacation or only a summer vacation or both. 

Let's assume that Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. Then, 40% take both a winter and a summer vacation, and Q% take only a summer vacation. Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation is 40% + Q%. 

We know that 75 employees take a winter vacation, which is 75% of the total number of employees. Therefore, the total number of employees is 100. 

We can set up an equation using the information we have: 

40% + Q% + 5% = 100% - 20% 

Simplifying the equation: 

Q% = 35% 

Therefore, the answer is (D) 35%. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. 
Given, 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation. 
Also, 40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations. 
20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation. 

Now, we can find the number of employees who take a summer vacation by subtracting the number of employees who take neither vacation from the total number of employees: 

Total employees = 100
Employees who take neither vacation = 20
Employees who take at least one vacation = 100 - 20 = 80
Employees who take a winter vacation = 75
Employees who take both vacations = 40

Therefore, the number of employees who take only a summer vacation is: 

Employees who take only a summer vacation = Employees who take a summer vacation - Employees who take both vacations
= (Q/100) x Total employees - 40

We want to find Q such that the above expression is equal to (Q/100) x Total employees. 

So, we have: 

(Q/100) x Total employees - 40 = (Q/100) x Total employees - (75 + 20)

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

55 = (Q/100) x Total employees

Q = (55/Total employees) x 100

Q = (55/100) x 100

Q = 55

Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 55%.

Topic: Math
Question: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 10
  C: 12
  D: 15
  E: 19
Response 0:
Let's assume that x helpers are required.

In 3 hours, the helpers can make:
- 2 large cakes/hour/helper * x helpers * 3 hours = 6x large cakes
- 35 small cakes/hour/helper * x helpers * 3 hours = 105x small cakes

We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, so we can set up the following system of equations:

6x = 20   (to make 20 large cakes)
105x = 700  (to make 700 small cakes)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 10

Therefore, 10 helpers are required.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's assume that x helpers are required. Then, the number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours by x helpers is 2x*3 = 6x. Similarly, the number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours by x helpers is 35x*3 = 105x. 

We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. So, we can write two equations based on the number of cakes made by x helpers in 3 hours:

6x >= 20   (since we need at least 20 large cakes)
105x >= 700  (since we need at least 700 small cakes)

Solving these equations, we get:
x >= 10/3  (dividing the first equation by 6)
x >= 20/3  (dividing the second equation by 105)

So, we need at least 7 helpers to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours. However, we cannot have a fraction of a helper, so we need to round up to the nearest integer. Therefore, we need 8 helpers.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to prepare the cakes. Then, the number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours is 2*x*3 = 6*x and the number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours is 35*x*3 = 105*x. We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, so we can write the following system of equations:

6*x >= 20
105*x >= 700

Solving for x, we get:

x >= 20/6 = 10/3
x >= 700/105 = 20/3

Since we need a whole number of helpers, we can round up the minimum value of x, which is 20/3. Therefore, we need at least 7 helpers. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let's assume that x helpers are required.
So, each helper can make 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes in an hour.
Therefore, x helpers can make 2x large cakes or 35x small cakes in an hour.
As per the question, 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes are needed.
So, the equation can be written as:
2xh + 35xh = 20 + 700
37xh = 720
xh = 19.45
As the number of helpers should be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, 20 helpers are required.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to complete the task.

In 3 hours, the number of large cakes that can be made is 2 * x * 3 = 6x
In 3 hours, the number of small cakes that can be made is 35 * x * 3 = 105x
So, the total number of large and small cakes that can be made in 3 hours is 6x + 105x = 111x

To make 20 large cakes, the number of helpers required is 20/(2*3) = 3.33 (approx.)
To make 700 small cakes, the number of helpers required is 700/35*3 = 20

Since we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up the number of helpers required to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the number of helpers required is max(4, 20) = 20

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to prepare the cakes. Then, the number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours is 2*x*3 = 6*x and the number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours is 35*x*3 = 105*x. 

We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. So, we can write two equations based on the number of cakes made by x helpers:

6*x >= 20  (since we need at least 20 large cakes)
105*x >= 700  (since we need at least 700 small cakes)

Solving these equations, we get:
x >= 20/6 = 10/3
x >= 700/105 = 20/3

Since we need a whole number of helpers, we need to round up the value of x to the nearest integer. Therefore, we need at least 4 helpers to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to prepare the cakes.

So, the number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 2 * x * 3 = 6x

The number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 35 * x * 3 = 105x

We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.

So, 6x >= 20  => x >= 20/6  => x >= 10/3

and 105x >= 700  => x >= 20/3

Therefore, the minimum number of helpers required is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 10/3, which is 4.

Hence, Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes.
So, the number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 2 * x * 3 = 6x
And, the number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 35 * x * 3 = 105x
We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in total.
So, 6x >= 20  => x >= 20/6 = 10/3
And, 105x >= 700 => x >= 20/3
Therefore, the minimum number of helpers required is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 10/3, which is 4.
Hence, Answer("None of the above") is the most likely answer.
Response 8:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes.
So, the number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours by x helpers = 2 * x * 3 = 6x
The number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours by x helpers = 35 * x * 3 = 105x
Total number of large and small cakes required = 20 + 700 = 720
Let's divide the required number of cakes by the number of cakes that can be made in 3 hours by x helpers.
720 = 6x + 105x
720 = 111x
x = 6.48 (approx)
As we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up the value of x to the nearest integer.
Therefore, the number of helpers required = 7 (approx)
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") - The closest answer is A: 8, but the correct answer is 7.
Response 9:
Let's assume that x helpers are required.
Then, the number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours by x helpers = 2 * x * 3 = 6x
The number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours by x helpers = 35 * x * 3 = 105x
We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
So, 6x >= 20  => x >= 20/6 = 10/3
and 105x >= 700 => x >= 20/3
Therefore, x >= 10/3. Since x is an integer, the minimum value of x that satisfies the above conditions is 4.
So, 4 helpers are required.

Question: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
Choices:
  A: 4,000
  B: 4,200
  C: 4,500
  D: 4,800
  E: 5,000
Response 0:
Let's assume that the factory produced x staplers on Monday. 

The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced = 90% of x = 0.9x

Now, out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 2% of 0.9x = 0.018x

We are given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So, we can set up the equation:

0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day was 4000.

Response 2:
Let's assume that the factory produced x staplers on Monday. Then, the number of defective staplers produced is 0.1x. The number of non-defective staplers produced is 0.9x. Out of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake, which is 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x staplers. We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the following equation:

0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4000

Therefore, the factory produced 4000 staplers on Monday.

The number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday = 90% of x = 0.9x

Now, out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 2% of 0.9x = 0.018x

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So, we can write:

0.018x = 72
x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the factory produced x staplers on Monday. 

The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced = 90% of x = 0.9x

Out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 2% of 0.9x = 0.018x

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So, we can write:

0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's assume that the number of staplers produced on Monday was "x". 
Then, the number of defective staplers produced on Monday was 0.1x. 
The number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday was 0.9x. 
Out of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake, which is 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x. 
We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation:
0.018x = 72
Solving for x, we get:
x = 4000
Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4000.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 

We know that P(at least one of A or B occurs) = P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). 

Substituting the values we know, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let P(B) = x. Then, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + x - 0.6x. 

Given that P(A or B) = 0.96, we have:

0.6 + x - 0.6x = 0.96

Solving for x, we get:

0.4x = 0.36

x = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 

We know that P(at least one of A or B) = P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). 

Substituting the values we know, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Then, we know that:

P(A) = 0.6
P(A or B) = 0.96

Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Substituting the given values, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. 

Since A and B are independent, we have P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). 

If we substitute the given values, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - P(A and B)

We don't know P(A and B), but we do know that it is less than or equal to the smaller of P(A) and P(B), since they are independent. So, P(A and B) <= min(0.6, P(B)).

Therefore, we have:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - P(A and B) <= 0.6 + P(B) - min(0.6, P(B)) = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)

Simplifying, we get:

0.36 <= 0.4P(B)

0.9 <= P(B)

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 5:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.
We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96.
Since A and B are independent, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).
We can rearrange this equation to solve for P(B):
P(B) = P(A or B) - P(A) + P(A and B)
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) (since A and B are independent)
Substituting the values we know:
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.9
Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 

We know that P(at least one of A or B) = P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). 

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.36 = 0.4P(B)

P(B) = 0.36/0.4 = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring. 

We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. 

Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula: 

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) 

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) 

Substituting the given values, we get: 

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)) 

Solving for P(B), we get: 

P(B) = 0.8 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 

We know that P(at least one of A or B) = P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). 

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: 

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 9:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 

We know that P(A) = 0.6. 

We also know that P(at least one of A or B) = P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.96. 

Substituting the values we know, we get:

0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) = 0.96

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.4 + 0.4P(B) = 0.96

0.4P(B) = 0.56

P(B) = 0.56 / 0.4

P(B) = 1.4

Since the probability of an event cannot be greater than 1, we know that there must be an error in the question or the answer choices. Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.

Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
Choices:
  A: 80
  B: 120
  C: 240
  D: 320
  E: 360
Response 0:
Let's first find out how many golf balls the store sold. If it sold 80% of its inventory, then it sold 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 240 white golf balls. Therefore, the store had 600 - 240 = 360 yellow golf balls to begin the day.

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 240 of each color. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it must have started with 240 white golf balls. Therefore, it started with 600 - 240 = 360 yellow golf balls.

Response 3:
Let's assume that the store had x yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it also had x white golf balls at the beginning of the day. 

The total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day was 600, so we can write an equation: 

x + x = 600 

Simplifying the equation: 

2x = 600 

x = 300 

So the store had 300 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. 

If the store sold 80% of its inventory, it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it must have sold 240 yellow golf balls. 

Therefore, the store had 300 - 240 = 60 yellow golf balls left at the end of the day.

Response 6:
Let's start by finding out how many golf balls were sold. 

80% of 600 = 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls were sold. 

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and all of the white golf balls were sold, then half of the 480 golf balls sold were white. 

So, the store had 240 white golf balls to begin with, which means it had 360 yellow golf balls to begin with (since the total number of golf balls was 600). 

Action: Answer("E")

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
Choices:
  A: $8
  B: $10
  C: $13.6
  D: $22.9
  E: $40
Response 0:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After a 15% decrease, the new price of each article is (100% - 15%)x = 0.85x.
Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles is now $300 + $5x.
We can set up an equation: $300 + $5x = 0.85x * (5 + x)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$300 + $5x = 4.25x + 0.85x^2
0.85x^2 - 1.25x - $300 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
x = ($1.25 ± sqrt(1.25^2 + 4*0.85*$300))/2*0.85
x ≈ $13.6

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is:
x - 0.15x = 0.85x
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the new total cost is:
5 * 0.85x + $300 = 0.85(5x) + $300 = $300 + $4.25x
We know that $4.25x = $300, so x = $70.
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:
0.85x = 0.85($70) = $59.5
Answer: Answer("None of the above") - The closest answer is C ($13.6), but it is not correct.
Response 2:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is (100% - 15%)x = 0.85x.
Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the new total cost is $300 + $5x.
The new total cost is also equal to the new price of each article multiplied by the new number of articles, which is (0.85x) * (5 + original number of articles).
So we have the equation:
0.85x * (5 + original number of articles) = $300 + $5x
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
0.85x * original number of articles = $250
original number of articles = $250 / (0.85x)
original number of articles = 294.12 (rounded to two decimal places)
So the original price of each article is:
x = $300 / 294.12
x = $1.02 (rounded to two decimal places)
The new price of each article is:
0.85x = 0.85 * $1.02
0.85x = $0.867
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is $0.867.
Answer: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x.
Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so:
5(0.85x) = $300
4.25x = $300
x = $70
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:
0.85x = 0.85($70) = $59.50

Answer: Answer("None of the above") 

Note: None of the given choices match the calculated answer. The correct answer is $59.50.
Response 4:
Solution: 

Let the original price of each article be x.

After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is:

x - 0.15x = 0.85x

Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so:

5(0.85x) = $300

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4.25x = $300

Dividing both sides by 4.25, we get:

x = $70

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:

0.85x = 0.85($70) = $59.50

Answer: Answer("None of the above") - The correct answer is not among the choices.
Response 5:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price of each article decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is (100% - 15%)x = 85%x.
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles is now $300 + $5x.
We can set up the equation: $300 + $5x = 85%x * (5 + x)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$300 + $5x = 0.85x^2 + 4.25x
0.85x^2 - 0.75x - $300 = 0
Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get:
x = ($0.75 ± √($0.75^2 + 4*0.85*$300))/(2*0.85)
x ≈ $13.6
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 85% of $13.6, which is approximately $11.56.
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") [The closest answer is C: $13.6, but the actual new selling price is approximately $11.56]

Question: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 1120
  C: 792
  D: 1320
  E: 1200
Response 0:
Let's assume the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively. 

When folded along length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is 24cm. Hence, the new breadth becomes b/2. 

Perimeter of each part = 2(24 + b/2) = 48 + b
Simplifying the above equation, we get b = 24

Similarly, when folded along breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the breadth of each part is 33cm. Hence, the new length becomes l/2.

Perimeter of each part = 2(33 + l/2) = 66 + l
Simplifying the above equation, we get l = 44

Area of the rectangular sheet = l * b = 44 * 24 = 1056 sq.cm

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("None of the above"). The correct answer is 1056.

Response 4:
Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively. 

When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is 24cm. Therefore, the length of the sheet is 2*24 = 48cm. 

When folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the breadth of each part is 33cm. Therefore, the breadth of the sheet is 2*33 = 66cm. 

Hence, the area of the sheet is l*b = 48*66 = 3168 sq.cm.

Response 8:
Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively. 

When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is (48/2) = 24cm. Therefore, the length of the rectangular sheet is l = 2*24 = 48cm. 

When folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the breadth of each part is (66/2) = 33cm. Therefore, the breadth of the rectangular sheet is b = 2*33 = 66cm. 

The area of the rectangular sheet is A = l*b = 48*66 = 3168 sq.cm. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above") 

The correct answer is not among the choices.
Response 9:
Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be 'l' and 'b', respectively. 

When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is (48/2) = 24cm. Therefore, we have:

2l + b = 48  ...(1)

When folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the breadth of each part is (66/2) = 33cm. Therefore, we have:

l + 2b = 66  ...(2)

Solving equations (1) and (2), we get:

l = 18cm and b = 15cm

Therefore, the area of the rectangular sheet is:

A = l x b = 18 x 15 = 270 sq.cm

Hence, the answer is:

Question: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.
Choices:
  A: 2 miles
  B: 2.25 miles
  C: 3.25 miles
  D: 3.85 miles
  E: 2.85 miles
Response 0:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. 

Action: Answer("E") 

21 minutes = 21/60 hours = 0.35 hours 

Next, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time 

On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph 

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles 

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, the answer is 3.85 miles. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3.85 miles.

21 minutes is equal to 0.35 hours (21/60 = 0.35). 

Next, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time 

On a normal day, Bill's rate is 15 mph. So on a windy day, his rate is 15 - 4 = 11 mph. 

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours 

distance = 3.85 miles 

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, the answer is 3.85 miles. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3.85 miles.

Response 9:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

On a normal day, Bill can travel 15 miles in 1 hour, so in 0.35 hours he can travel 15 x 0.35 = 5.25 miles.

On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed is now 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Using the formula distance = rate x time, we can calculate the distance he can travel on a windy day in 0.35 hours:

distance = 11 x 0.35 = 3.85 miles

Therefore, the answer is D: 3.85 miles.

Let's start by finding the ratio of red sweets to green sweets in terms of a variable. Let x be the number of red sweets in the bag. Then we have:

red sweets : green sweets = 3 : 4

This can be written as:

x : 120 = 3 : 4

Cross-multiplying gives:

4x = 360

Dividing both sides by 4 gives:

x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Let's first find the ratio of red sweets to green sweets in terms of 120 green sweets. 

For every 4 green sweets, there are 3 red sweets. So for 120 green sweets, we can set up a proportion:

4/120 = 3/x

where x is the number of red sweets. 

Simplifying the proportion, we get:

4x = 360

x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost:
420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months/year = $554,400/year

To make a profit of $626,400/year, the revenue from sales must be:
$626,400/year + $554,400/year = $1,180,800/year

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the total revenue by the number of components produced per year:
$1,180,800/year ÷ 420 units/month * 12 months/year = $230/unit

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $230.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost: 

420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months/year = $554,400/year

To make a profit of $626,400/year, the revenue from sales must be:

$626,400/year + $554,400/year = $1,180,800/year

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee this revenue, we need to divide the total revenue by the number of units produced per year:

$1,180,800/year ÷ 420 units/month * 12 months/year = $230/unit

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost: 

Yearly production cost = 420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months = $554,400

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to find the total revenue required to achieve this profit. 

Total profit = Total revenue - Yearly production cost
$626,400 = Total revenue - $554,400
Total revenue = $1,180,800

Now we can find the minimum selling price per component: 

Minimum selling price = Total revenue / Total units produced per year
Minimum selling price = $1,180,800 / (420 units/month * 12 months)
Minimum selling price = $233.33

The closest answer choice is (B) 230. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months = $554,400

To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue must be:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + $626,400 = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced in a year:
Minimum selling price per component = Yearly revenue / Number of components produced in a year
Number of components produced in a year = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units/year

Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months = $554,400

To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue from sales must be:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + $626,400 = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced in a year:
Minimum selling price per component = Yearly revenue / Total number of components produced
Total number of components produced = 420 units/month x 12 months = 5,040 units/year

Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + Desired profit = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced per year:
Minimum selling price per component = Yearly revenue / Number of components produced per year
Number of components produced per year = 420 units/month x 12 months = 5,040 units/year

Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5,040 = $234

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months = $554,400

To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue from sales should be:
Yearly revenue = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced per year:
Minimum selling price per component = Yearly revenue / Number of components produced per year
Number of components produced per year = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units/year
Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units/year = $234.13

The closest answer choice is (C) 240. However, the exact minimum selling price per component is $234.13.

To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue from sales should be:
Yearly revenue = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced in a year:
Minimum selling price per component = Yearly revenue / Number of components produced in a year
Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / (420 units/month x 12 months)
Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5,040
Minimum selling price per component = $234

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months = $554,400

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, we need to use the following formula:
Yearly profit = (Selling price per unit - Production cost per unit) x Number of units sold per year

We know the yearly production cost is $554,400, and we need a yearly profit of $626,400, so:
Yearly profit = Selling price per unit x 5040 - $554,400 = $626,400
Selling price per unit x 5040 = $1,180,800
Selling price per unit = $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 62
  C: 82
  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Let's solve this problem using algebra. 

Let x be the first integer, then the sum of k consecutive integers is:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1)

We know that the least integer is -50, so x = -50. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

-50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51

Simplifying this equation, we get:

k(2*(-50) + k - 1) = 102

2k^2 - 2k - 203 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

k = (2 ± sqrt(4 + 8*203)) / 4

k = (2 ± 40) / 4

k = -19/2 or k = 21

Since k has to be a positive integer, the only possible value is k = 21.

Let's solve this problem using algebra. 

Let x be the first integer, then the sum of k consecutive integers can be expressed as:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1)

Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we can simplify this expression to:

kx + (1+2+...+(k-1))

kx + (k-1)k/2

We are given that the first integer is -50, so x = -50. We are also given that the sum of the k integers is 51, so we can set up the equation:

k(-50) + (k-1)k/2 = 51

Simplifying this equation, we get:

-50k + (k^2-k)/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we get:

-k^2 + k - 100 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we can solve for k:

k = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/2a

where a = -1, b = 1, and c = -100. Plugging in these values, we get:

k = (-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4(1)(100)))/(-2)

k = (-1 ± sqrt(401))/(-2)

k = (-1 ± 20)/(-2)

k = 21 or k = -20

Since we are looking for a positive value of k, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")  (k = 21)
Response 4:
Let's solve this problem using algebra. 

Let x be the first integer, then the sum of k consecutive integers is:

Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we can simplify this expression to:

kx + (1+2+...+(k-1))

kx + (k-1)k/2

We know that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51, so we can set up the equation:

kx + (k-1)k/2 = 51

Substituting x = -50, we get:

-50k + (k-1)k/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we get:

-100k + k^2 - k = 102

Rearranging and simplifying, we get:

k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0

Factoring, we get:

(k-1)(k-100) = 0

Therefore, k = 1 or k = 100. We can eliminate k = 1 because we are given that there are k consecutive integers and k must be greater than 1. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")  (k = 100)

Response 6:
Let's solve this problem using algebra. 

Let x be the first integer, then the sum of k consecutive integers starting from x is given by:
x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1)

Since the least integer is -50, we have x = -50. Substituting this into the above expression, we get:
-50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
k(-50) + (1+2+3+...+(k-1)) = 51

Using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, we get:
k(-50) + (k-1)k/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 and rearranging, we get:
k^2 - 99k + 102 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:
k = (99 ± sqrt(99^2 - 4*1*102))/2
k = (99 ± sqrt(9603))/2

Since k must be a positive integer, we take the positive root:
k = (99 + sqrt(9603))/2 ≈ 40.96

Since k must be an integer, the closest integer to 40.96 is 41.

Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("A")

k(-50) + (1+2+3+...+(k-1)) = 51

k(-50) + (k-1)k/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

2k(-50) + k(k-1) = 102

Simplifying, we get:

k^2 - 49k + 102 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

k = (49 ± sqrt(49^2 - 4*102))/2

k = (49 ± sqrt(1849 - 408))/2

k = (49 ± sqrt(1441))/2

Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
Response 0:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. When we trim 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. When we cut this rectangular piece diagonally in half, we get two right triangles with legs (x-4) and x. 

The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. We can use the formula for the area of a right triangle to write an equation:

(1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:

x = [4 ± sqrt(4^2 - 4*1*(-140))] / (2*1) = [4 ± sqrt(656)] / 2

Since x is the length of a side of the original square piece of cloth, it must be positive. Therefore, we take the positive root:

x = [4 + sqrt(656)] / 2 = 18

So the original piece of cloth was a square with side length 18 feet. Its perimeter was 4 times this length, or 72 feet.

Answer: Action: Answer("None of the above") (The correct answer is 72, which is not one of the choices given.)
Response 1:
Let's denote the side of the original square piece of cloth as x. 

After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions x-4 and x. 

Cutting this rectangular piece diagonally in half creates two right triangles, each with legs x-4 and x/2. 

We know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

(1/2)(x-4)(x/2) = 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x^2 - 8x - 280 = 0

Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get:

x = 18 or x = -10

Since x represents a length, we can disregard the negative solution. Therefore, the original square piece of cloth had a side length of 18 feet. 

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x, which is 72 feet. 

Answer: Answer("E") 64
Response 2:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, two right triangles are formed. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. We can use this information to form an equation:

(1/2)(x-4)(x)(1/2) = 70
(x-4)(x) = 280
x^2 - 4x - 280 = 0

We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:

x = [4 ± sqrt(4^2 - 4(1)(-280))] / (2)
x = [4 ± sqrt(1124)] / 2
x = 14 or x = -10

Since the side of the square piece of cloth cannot be negative, we can discard the negative solution. Therefore, the original side of the square piece of cloth was 14 feet. The perimeter of the original piece of cloth was 4x = 4(14) = 56 feet.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. When we trim 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. When we cut this rectangular piece diagonally in half, we get two right triangles with legs (x-4) and x. 

We know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to solve for x:

(1/2)(x-4)(x) = 70

Multiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get:

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

We can factor this quadratic equation as:

(x-14)(x+10) = 0

Since the side of the square piece of cloth cannot be negative, we can discard the solution x = -10. Therefore, the original side of the square piece of cloth was x = 14 feet.

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x = 4(14) = 56 feet.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's assume the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. 

The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. We know that the area of a triangle is given by the formula (1/2) * base * height. Since the two triangles are congruent, their bases and heights are equal. Therefore, we can write:

(1/2) * base * height = 70
base * height = 140

We also know that the base and height of each triangle are the two sides of the rectangular piece of cloth that was cut diagonally. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:

(base)^2 + (height)^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16

Since base * height = 140, we can substitute height = 140/base into the above equation to get:

(base)^2 + (140/base)^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16

Multiplying both sides by (base)^2, we get:

(base)^4 - (2x^2 - 8x + 16)(base)^2 + (140)^2 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in (base)^2. Using the quadratic formula, we get:

(base)^2 = [(2x^2 - 8x + 16) ± sqrt((2x^2 - 8x + 16)^2 - 4(140)^2)]/2

Simplifying this expression, we get:

(base)^2 = [x^2 - 4x + 18 ± sqrt(x^4 - 8x^3 + 36x^2 - 896)]/2

Since (base)^2 is positive, we can discard the negative root. Therefore, we have:

(base)^2 = [x^2 - 4x + 18 + sqrt(x^4 - 8x^3 + 36x^2 - 896)]/2

Now, we can use the fact that the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x feet. Therefore, we have:

4x = 2(base) + 2(x-4)
4x = 2(base) + 2x - 8
2(base) = 2x - 8
(base) = x - 4

Substituting this value of (base) into the expression we derived earlier, we get:

(base)^2 = [x^2 - 4x + 18 + sqrt(x^4 - 8x^3 + 36x^2 - 896)]/2
(x-4)^2 = [x^2 - 4x + 18 + sqrt(x^4 - 8x^3 + 36x^2 - 896)]/2
2(x-4)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 18 + sqrt(x^4 - 8x^3 + 36x^2 - 896)

Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get:

x^4 - 20x^3 + 148x^2 - 448x + 400 = 0

This is another quadratic equation in x. Using the quadratic formula, we get:

x = [20 ± sqrt(20^2 - 4*148*(-448))]/2/148
x = [20 ± sqrt(14084)]/296
x = [20 ± 118]/296

Since x cannot be negative, we take the positive root:

x = [20 + 118]/296 = 0.46 feet

Therefore, the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x = 1.84 feet, which is approximately equal to 58 feet.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Let the original side of the square piece of cloth be x. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) by x. The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. 

Cutting the rectangular piece diagonally in half creates two congruent right triangles, each with legs x and (x-4) and area 70 square feet. The area of a right triangle is (1/2) base times height, so we have:

(1/2) x (x-4) = 70
x^2 - 4x - 280 = 0
(x-20)(x+14) = 0

Since x represents a length, we take the positive root x = 20. Therefore, the original piece of cloth was a square with side length 20 feet, and its perimeter was 4x = 80 feet.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. 

The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x square feet. 

When the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, two right triangles are formed. Each of these triangles has an area of 70 square feet. 

Let's use the formula for the area of a right triangle: (base x height) / 2 = 70. Since the two triangles are congruent, we can solve for the base and height of one of the triangles. 

(base x height) / 2 = 70
base x height = 140

We also know that the base and height of the triangle are the two legs of the right triangle formed by cutting the rectangular piece in half diagonally. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the length of the hypotenuse (which is also the length of the original side of the square piece of cloth):

(base)^2 + (height)^2 = (hypotenuse)^2
(base)^2 + (height)^2 = x^2
(base)^2 + (height)^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2
2(base)^2 + 8x - 16 = 0
(base)^2 + 4x - 8 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

base = (-4 ± sqrt(16 + 32)) / 2
base = (-4 ± 6) / 2

We can ignore the negative root, so:

base = 1 or base = 3

If the base is 1, then the height is 140. But this doesn't make sense because the base and height should be roughly the same length (since the original piece of cloth was a square). 

If the base is 3, then the height is 140/3. This makes more sense because the base and height are closer in length. 

So the original side of the square piece of cloth was x = (base + 4) = 7 feet. The perimeter of the original piece of cloth was 4x = 28 feet. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the original square piece of cloth had a side length of x feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x. When this piece is cut diagonally in half, each triangle has base (x-4) and height x, so each triangle has an area of (1/2)(x-4)(x) = 70. Solving for x, we get x = 14. 

Therefore, the original square piece of cloth had a side length of 14 feet, and its perimeter was 4x = 56 feet.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let the original side of the square be x. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangle are (x-4) by x. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the diagonal of the rectangle:
diagonal^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2
diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
diagonal = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)

Since the rectangle is cut in half to form two congruent triangles, the area of each triangle is (1/2)(x-4)x/2 = 70. Simplifying, we get:
x^2 - 4x - 280 = 0
(x-20)(x+14) = 0

Since x represents the length of a side of the square, it must be positive, so x = 20. Therefore, the original perimeter of the square was 4x = 80.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let the original side of the square piece of cloth be x. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) by x. The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. 

Cutting the rectangular piece diagonally in half creates two right triangles, each with legs x-4 and x/2. The area of each triangle is (1/2)(x-4)(x/2) = 70. Simplifying this equation gives x^2 - 8x - 560 = 0. 

Factoring this quadratic equation gives (x-28)(x+20) = 0. Since the side length of the square piece of cloth cannot be negative, we have x = 28. 

Therefore, the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x = 4(28) = 112 feet.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:
  A: 46
  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
Let's call the width of the parking space "w". We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so the length of the parking space is 9 + w. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we can set up the equation:

2w + (9 + w) = 37

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3w + 9 = 37

3w = 28

w = 9.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

So the width of the parking space is approximately 9.33 feet, and the length is approximately 18.33 feet (9 + 9.33). Therefore, the area of the parking space is:

A = length x width = 18.33 x 9.33 = 170.56

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:

A ≈ 171

Therefore, the answer is (E) None of the above, since none of the choices match the calculated area.
Response 1:
Let the length of the painted side be x and the width be y. We know that y = 9 feet and 2x + y = 37 feet. Solving for x, we get x = 14 feet. Therefore, the area of the parking space is xy = 14 * 9 = 126 square feet. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's denote the length of the painted sides as x and y. We know that x + y + 9 = 37, which implies that x + y = 28. We also know that the area of the rectangle is given by A = xy. We can use the fact that x + y = 28 to solve for y in terms of x, which gives us y = 28 - x. Substituting this expression for y into the equation for the area, we get A = x(28 - x) = 28x - x^2. To maximize the area, we need to find the value of x that maximizes this expression. The maximum occurs at x = 14, which gives us a maximum area of A = 14(28 - 14) = 196 square feet.

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let's assume that the length of the painted sides are L and W. We know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we can write an equation: 

L + W + L = 37 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

2L + W = 37 

We also know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so: 

L + W = 28 

We can now solve for L and W: 

2L + W = 37 

2L + (L + 9) = 37 

3L = 28 

L = 9.33 

W = 18.67 

The area of the parking space is L x W = 9.33 x 18.67 = 173.78 

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get: 

Action: Answer("C") 
Response 4:
Let's denote the length of the painted side by L and the width of the parking space by W. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so we have L + 2W = 37 and W = 9. Solving for L, we get L = 19. Substituting L and W into the formula for the area of a rectangle, we get A = LW = 19(9) = 171. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let's denote the length of the painted side as x and the width of the parking space as y. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so y = 9. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so 2x + y = 37. Substituting y = 9, we get 2x + 9 = 37, which gives us x = 14. 

Therefore, the area of the parking space is xy = 14 * 9 = 126 square feet. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's call the length of the parking space "l" and the width "w". We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so we can set up the equation:

l + 2w = 37

We can also use the fact that the area of a rectangle is given by:

A = lw

We want to solve for A, so we need to find l and w in terms of the information given. We can rearrange the first equation to solve for l:

l = 37 - 2w

Substituting this into the equation for the area, we get:

A = (37 - 2w)w

Simplifying this expression, we get:

A = 37w - 2w^2

To maximize the area, we need to find the value of w that makes this expression as large as possible. We can do this by taking the derivative of the expression with respect to w and setting it equal to zero:

dA/dw = 37 - 4w = 0

Solving for w, we get:

w = 9.25

Substituting this value back into the expression for A, we get:

A = 37(9.25) - 2(9.25)^2 = 126.125

So the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's call the length of the painted side x and the width of the rectangle y. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9, so y = 9. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37, so 2x + y = 37. Substituting y = 9, we get 2x + 9 = 37, which gives us x = 14. 

Now we can find the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width: A = xy = 14 * 9 = 126. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's call the length of the painted side x and the width of the parking space y. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9, so we can write the equation:

2x + y = 37

We also know that the area of a rectangle is given by A = xy, so we need to find the value of xy. We can solve for y in the first equation:

y = 37 - 2x

Substituting this into the area equation, we get:

A = x(37 - 2x)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

A = 37x - 2x^2

To find the maximum value of A, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to x and set it equal to zero:

dA/dx = 37 - 4x = 0

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9.25

Substituting this value back into the equation for y, we get:

y = 37 - 2(9.25) = 18.5

So the area of the parking space is:

A = xy = 9.25(18.5) = 170.125

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's call the length of the parking space "l" and the width "w". We know that one of the sides (width) is unpainted and has a length of 9 feet. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the other three sides (two lengths and one width) is 37 feet. So we can set up the equation:

2l + w = 37

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the width:

w = 37 - 2l

We also know that the area of a rectangle is length times width, so:

Area = l * w

Substituting the expression we found for w:

Area = l * (37 - 2l)

Expanding the expression:

Area = 37l - 2l^2

To find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the expression with respect to l, set it equal to zero, and solve for l:

d(Area)/dl = 37 - 4l = 0
l = 37/4

We can confirm that this is a maximum by taking the second derivative:

d^2(Area)/dl^2 = -4 < 0

So the maximum area occurs when l = 37/4. Plugging this back into the expression for Area:

Area = 37(37/4) - 2(37/4)^2
Area = 126.125

So the answer is approximately 126, which is closest to choice C.

Question: Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
Choices:
  A: 30 feet
  B: 20 feet
  C: 10 feet
  D: 50 feet
  E: 60 feet
Response 0:
We can solve this problem using the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is A = L x W, where A is the area, L is the length, and W is the width. We are given that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide, so we can substitute W = 100 into the formula and get:

A = L x 100

We are also given that the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, so we can substitute A = 3,000 into the formula and get:

3,000 = L x 100

To solve for L, we can divide both sides by 100:

3,000/100 = L

30 = L

Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

Question: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 8
  C: 22
  D: 50
  E: 20
Response 0:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, his rate of work is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. 

If Jack finished two-thirds of the work, then the remaining one-third of the work is represented by (1/3)W. 

Jill's rate of work is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means her rate of work is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour. 

Let's assume that it takes Jill "x" hours to finish the remaining work. 

Using the work formula (work = rate x time), we can set up the following equation: 

(1/3)W = (1/240) * x * W 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

x = 80 

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the entire job takes J hours to complete. 

Since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the job per hour. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he completes (2/3)J of the job. 

The remaining portion of the work is (1/3)J, which is completed by Jill. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, her rate of cleaning is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the job per hour. 

We can use the formula: 

rate * time = work 

to find out how long it takes Jill to complete the remaining work. 

(1/240) * t = (1/3)J 

Solving for t, we get: 

t = (1/3)J * 240 

t = 80J 

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the total work is 1 (a cleaned yacht). Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of work is 1/12. On a particular day, Jack completes two-thirds of the work, which is (2/3) * 1 = 2/3. So, the remaining work is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which is 5/100 * (1/12) = 1/240. Let's assume that Jill takes x hours to complete the remaining work. So, her rate of work is 1/x.

We can set up an equation using the rates of work:
Jack's rate + Jill's rate = Combined rate
1/12 + 1/x = 1/[(2/3)*1]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
1/x = 1/[(2/3)*1] - 1/12
1/x = 1/[(2/3)] - 1/12
1/x = 1.5 - 1/12
1/x = 1.3333
x = 1/[(4/3)]
x = 0.75

Therefore, Jill takes 0.75 hours to complete the remaining work.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his work rate is W/12. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he completes (2/3)W of the work. 

The remaining portion of the work is (1/3)W. 

Jill's work rate is 5% of Jack's work rate, which means her work rate is (5/100) * (W/12) = W/240. 

Let's assume that Jill takes "x" hours to complete the remaining work. 

Using the work formula (work = rate * time), we can set up the following equation: 

(1/3)W = (W/240) * x 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

x = (1/3) * 240 = 80 

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to complete the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the remaining one-third of the work is left for Jill to complete. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. So, her rate of cleaning is 5/100 * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour. 

Let's assume that it takes Jill "x" hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work. 

Using the above information, we can set up the equation: 

(1/3) = (2/3) * (1/12) * (x) + (1/3) * (1/240) * (x)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

1/3 = (x/36) + (x/720)

Multiplying both sides by the least common multiple of the denominators (720), we get: 

240 = 20x + x 

240 = 21x 

x = 240/21 

x ≈ 11.43 

Therefore, it takes Jill approximately 11.43 hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by 1. 

Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in one hour. On a particular day, he finished two-thirds of the work, which means he cleaned 2/3 of the yacht. The remaining portion of the work is 1/3 of the yacht.

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. This means that Jill can clean 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 of the yacht in one hour.

Let's assume that it takes Jill "x" hours to finish the remaining work. 

So, Jill can clean 1/240 of the yacht in one hour. Therefore, the equation becomes:

1/3 = (2/3) * (1/12) + (1/240) * x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

1/3 = 1/18 + 1/240 * x

Multiplying both sides by 240, we get:

80 = 40 + x

x = 40

Therefore, it takes Jill 40 hours to finish the remaining work.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's assume that the entire work is equivalent to 12 units (since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours). If Jack completes two-thirds of the work, then he completes 8 units of work (12 x 2/3 = 8). The remaining work is 4 units (12 - 8 = 4). 

Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do, which means she can clean 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 of the yacht in an hour. To clean the remaining 4 units of work, Jill will need:

4 / (1/240) = 960 hours

Therefore, it will take Jill 960 hours to finish the remaining work.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Let's assume the total work to be done is 1 unit. Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in 1 hour. On a particular day, Jack finished two-thirds of the work, which means he cleaned (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 of the yacht. The remaining portion of the work is (1 - 2/3) = 1/3 of the yacht. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means she can clean (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht in 1 hour. Let's assume Jill takes x hours to finish the remaining work. So, in x hours, Jill can clean (1/240) * x portion of the yacht. 

We know that Jack cleaned 2/3 of the yacht, so the remaining 1/3 of the yacht must be cleaned by Jill. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 

(1/240) * x = 1/3 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = (1/3) * 240 = 80 

Therefore, it will take Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Since Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, his work rate is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. 

On the particular day, Jack finished two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the remaining one-third of the work is left to be done. 

Let's represent the remaining work by the variable "R". Therefore, 

R = W - (2/3)W = (1/3)W 

Now, Jill's work rate is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, her work rate is (5/100) * (1/12) = (1/240) of the yacht per hour. 

We need to find how long it will take Jill to finish the remaining work. Let's represent the time taken by Jill by the variable "t". Therefore, 

(R/t) = (1/240) 

Solving for "t", we get: 

t = (R * 240) = [(1/3)W * 240] = 80W 

Therefore, Jill will take 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the work per hour. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he cleaned (2/3)W of the yacht. 

The remaining portion of the work is (1/3)W. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means her rate of cleaning is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the work per hour. 

Let's assume that Jill takes "x" hours to finish the remaining work. 

Using the work formula (work = rate x time), we can set up the following equation: 

(1/3)W = (1/240)W * x 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

x = (1/3) * 240 = 80 

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work.

Topic: Math
Question: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
Choices:
  A: 144km
  B: 72 km
  C: 126km
  D: 84 km
  E: 48km
Response 0:
Let's assume the distance between X and Y is d km. 

When they meet for the first time, let's say they have both traveled x km. 
At this point, Allen has traveled from X to Y and back for a total distance of 2x km. 
Bob has traveled from Y to X for a total distance of x km. 

Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can write:

2x = 54t   (where t is the time taken for Allen to travel from X to Y and back)
x = 78t    (since Bob travels at 78 kmph)

We can solve for t by equating the two expressions for x:

2x = 54t
x = 78t
Therefore:
54t = 78t/2
t = d/72

So, the time taken for Allen to travel from X to Y and back is d/72 hours. 

Now, let's consider their second meeting. At this point, Allen has traveled a total distance of d km (from X to Y and back), while Bob has traveled a total distance of 2d - 48 km (from Y to X and back, with an extra 48 km due to the initial difference in their distances from Y). 

Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can write:

d = 54 * (d/72)   (since Allen travels at 54 kmph)
2d - 48 = 78 * (d/72)   (since Bob travels at 78 kmph)

Solving these equations, we get:
d = 126 km

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 126 km. 

Answer: Option C (126km)
Response 1:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. 
Let the time taken for Allen to reach Y be t hours. 
Then, the time taken for Bob to reach X is also t hours. 
Distance travelled by Allen in t hours = 54t km. 
Distance travelled by Bob in t hours = 78t km. 
Distance travelled by Allen from Y to X = Distance travelled by Bob from X to Y (since they meet for the first time at this point). 
Let the distance travelled by Allen from Y to X be x km. 
Then, the distance travelled by Bob from X to Y is (d - x) km. 
Therefore, we have: 
54t = x  ------(1)
78t = d - x ------(2)
Also, we know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time. 
Let the time taken for them to meet for the second time be t2 hours. 
Then, we have: 
54t2 + 48 = 78t2 - 48 
24t2 = 96 
t2 = 4 
Therefore, the total time taken for them to meet for the second time is 2t2 = 8 hours. 
In 8 hours, Allen covers a distance of 54 x 8 = 432 km. 
Therefore, the distance between X and Y is: 
d = (78t + 54t)/2 = (78 x 4 + 54 x 4)/2 = 252 km. 

Answer: Answer("C") 252km.
Response 2:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken by Allen to reach Y be t hours. Then, the time taken by Bob to reach X is also t hours. 

Distance travelled by Allen in t hours = 54t km
Distance travelled by Bob in t hours = 78t km

When they meet for the first time, the total distance travelled by both of them is d km. 
Therefore, we have: 
54t + 78t = d   ...(1)

When they meet for the second time, the total distance travelled by both of them is 2d km. 
Therefore, we have: 
54t + 78t + 48 = 2d   ...(2)  (since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen)

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we get: 
48 = d

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 48 km.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let the distance between X and Y be d. Let the time taken by both Allen and Bob to meet for the first time be t. 

Distance covered by Allen in the first meeting = 54t
Distance covered by Bob in the first meeting = 78t

Total distance covered in the first meeting = d
Therefore, d = 54t + 78t = 132t

In the second meeting, Allen covers half the distance and Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Let the time taken for the second meeting be t2.

Distance covered by Allen in the second meeting = 0.5d = 66t
Distance covered by Bob in the second meeting = 66t + 48

Since they meet at the same time, we can equate the time taken by both of them.

66t = (d-48)/2*78
132t = d-48
132t = 132t + 48
d = 144 km

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 144 km.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken by both Allen and Bob to meet for the first time be t hours. 

In t hours, Allen covers a distance of 54t km and Bob covers a distance of 78t km. 

When they meet for the first time, the total distance they cover is d km. 

Therefore, we have: 

54t + 78t = d 

132t = d 

t = d/132 

When they meet for the second time, Allen would have covered a distance of 2d km (going from X to Y and back to X) and Bob would have covered a distance of 2d + 48 km (going from Y to X and back to Y, and covering an additional 48 km). 

Since they both meet at the same time, we can equate their times: 

time taken by Allen = time taken by Bob 

Distance/Speed = Distance/Speed 

2d/54 = (2d + 48)/78 

156d = 54(2d + 48) 

156d = 108d + 2592 

48d = 2592 

d = 54 

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 54 km. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's call the distance between X and Y as "d". 
Let's also call the time taken for Allen to reach Y as "t" (since Bob and Allen start at the same time, Bob also takes "t" time to reach X).
Distance covered by Allen in time "t" = 54t
Distance covered by Bob in time "t" = 78t
When they meet for the first time, the total distance covered by both of them is "d":
54t + 78t = d
132t = d  ---(1)
When Allen reaches X for the second time, Bob has covered an additional 48 km compared to Allen. So, the distance covered by Bob is (54t + 48) km and the distance covered by Allen is (d - 48 - 54t) km. They cover this distance in the same time "t":
(d - 48 - 54t)/54 = (54t + 48)/78
Solving this equation, we get:
d = 126 km
Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 126 km.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken for Allen to reach Y be t hours. Then, the time taken for Bob to reach X is also t hours. 

Distance covered by Allen in t hours = 54t
Distance covered by Bob in t hours = 78t

When they meet for the first time, the total distance covered by both of them is d. 
So, we have: 

54t + 78t = d    ...(1)

When they meet for the second time, the total distance covered by both of them is 2d. 
Distance covered by Allen in the second half of the journey = Distance covered by Bob in the first half of the journey
So, we have: 

54(t/2) = 78(t/2) + 48
27t = 78t + 48
51t = 48
t = 16/17 hours

Substituting t in equation (1), we get: 

54t + 78t = d
54(16/17) + 78(16/17) = d
d = 126 km

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 126 km.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's assume the distance between X and Y is "d" km. 
When they meet for the first time, let's say they have both covered "x" km. 
At this point, Allen has covered x km at 54 kmph, so he has taken x/54 hours. 
At the same time, Bob has covered (d-x) km at 78 kmph, so he has taken (d-x)/78 hours. 
Since they meet at the same time, we can set up an equation: 
x/54 = (d-x)/78 
Solving for x, we get: 
x = 18d/131 

When they meet for the second time, they have both covered the entire distance d. 
At this point, Allen has covered d-x km, which is: 
d-x = d - 18d/131 = 113d/131 

Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen, so: 
d+x+48 = 2(d-x) + 48 
d + 18d/131 + 48 = 2(113d/131) + 48 
Solving for d, we get: 
d = 252 km 

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 252 km. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's assume the distance between X and Y is "d" km.
Let's also assume that they meet for the second time "t" hours after they started.
When they meet for the first time, they have covered a total distance of "d" km.
Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can write:
Allen's distance + Bob's distance = d
54t + 78t = d
132t = d    ----(1)
When they meet for the second time, Allen has covered a distance of d km, and Bob has covered a distance of d + 48 km.
Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can write:
Allen's distance + Bob's distance = 2d + 48
54t + 78(t - d/78) = 2d + 48
Simplifying this equation, we get:
54t + 78t - 78d/78 = 2d + 48
132t - d = 2d + 48
Substituting (1) into this equation, we get:
132t - 132t = 2d + 48
2d = 48
d = 24
Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 24 km.
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Let's assume the distance between X and Y is d km. 

When they meet for the first time, let's say they have both traveled x km. 
At this point, Allen has traveled from X to Y and back for a total of 2x km. 
Bob has traveled from Y to X for a total of x km. 

Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can write two equations: 

2x = 54t   (Allen's distance equation)
x = 78t    (Bob's distance equation)

where t is the time they have been traveling before they meet for the first time. 

Solving for x in the second equation and substituting into the first equation, we get: 

2(78t) - 48 = 54t 

Simplifying, we get: 

102t = 48 

t = 48/102 = 8/17 hours 

Substituting t back into either equation, we can find x: 

x = 78t = 78(8/17) = 36.72 km 

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is: 

d = 2x = 2(36.72) = 73.44 km 

Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time, which means Bob has traveled a total of x + 48 km more than Allen. 

Using the same equations as before, we can find the time it takes for them to meet for the second time: 

2x + 48 = 54t   (Allen's distance equation)
x = 78t    (Bob's distance equation)

Substituting x from the second equation into the first equation, we get: 

2(78t) + 48 = 54t 

Simplifying, we get: 

102t = -48 

t = -48/102 = -8/17 hours 

This negative time doesn't make sense, so we made a mistake somewhere. Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
Response 0:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep as 'd' km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as 's' km/hr.

According to the problem, 

speed = distance / time

During the forward journey, 

s = d/6

During the return journey, 

s+12 = d/4

We need to find the value of 'd'.

We can solve the above two equations to get the value of 'd'.

d/6 + 12 = d/4

Multiplying both sides by 12, we get

2d + 144 = 3d

d = 144 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144km.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Solution: 

Let's assume that the jeep's speed during the forward journey is x km/hr. 

Then, the distance travelled during the forward journey = x * 6 km

During the return journey, the jeep's speed increased by 12km/hr. Therefore, the speed during the return journey = (x+12) km/hr.

The distance travelled during the return journey = (x+12) * 4 km

As the distance travelled during the forward journey is equal to the distance travelled during the return journey, we can equate the two expressions.

x * 6 = (x+12) * 4

Solving the above equation, we get x = 18 km/hr.

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep during the forward journey = 18 * 6 = 108 km.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep during the forward journey is "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

d = s * 6  (since the jeep took 6 hours during the forward journey)

d = (s + 12) * 4  (since the jeep increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours during the return journey)

Now we can solve for "s" by equating the above two equations:

s * 6 = (s + 12) * 4

6s = 4s + 48

2s = 48

s = 24

Now we can substitute the value of "s" in any of the above two equations to find "d":

d = s * 6 = 24 * 6 = 144 km

Therefore, the jeep travelled a distance of 144 km.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep as "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey as "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

Time taken in the forward journey = 6 hours

Time taken in the return journey = 4 hours

Speed of the jeep in the return journey = Speed of the jeep in the forward journey + 12 km/hr

We know that, 

Distance = Speed x Time

Using the above formula, 

Distance travelled in the forward journey = s x 6 = 6s

Distance travelled in the return journey = (s + 12) x 4 = 4s + 48

As per the problem, the distance travelled in the forward journey is equal to the distance travelled in the return journey. Therefore, 

6s = 4s + 48

2s = 48

s = 24 km/hr

Substituting the value of "s" in the equation for distance travelled in the forward journey, we get

Distance travelled in the forward journey = 6s = 6 x 24 = 144 km

Therefore, the jeep travelled a distance of 144 km.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

d = s x 6   ----(1)

d = (s + 12) x 4   ----(2)

From equation (1), we can get s = d/6

Substituting s in equation (2), we get 

d = (d/6 + 12) x 4

d = d/6 x 4 + 12 x 4

d - 4d/6 = 48

2d/3 = 48

d = 72 x 3/2

d = 108 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 108 km.

Answer: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Solution:
Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep as "d" km.
Let's also assume the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as "s" km/hr.
According to the problem, during the return journey, the jeep increased its speed by 12km/hr. Therefore, the speed of the jeep during the return journey was (s+12) km/hr.
We know that distance = speed x time.
Using this formula, we can write two equations based on the given information:
  d = s x 6   (since the jeep took 6 hours during the forward journey)
  d = (s+12) x 4   (since the jeep took 4 hours during the return journey)
From the first equation, we can write s = d/6.
Substituting this value of s in the second equation, we get:
  d = (d/6 + 12) x 4
Simplifying this equation, we get:
  d = 144
Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144km.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep as "d" km and the speed of the jeep as "s" km/hr.

During the forward journey, the jeep travelled "d" km at a speed of "s" km/hr for 6 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

d = 6s  ----(1)

During the return journey, the jeep travelled the same distance "d" km at a speed of (s+12) km/hr for 4 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

d = 4(s+12)  ----(2)

From equation (1), we can write s = d/6 and substitute it in equation (2) to get:

d = 4(d/6 + 12)
d = 2d/3 + 48
d/3 = 48
d = 144 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Solution: 

Let's assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is x km/hr. 

Distance = Speed x Time 

Forward journey: Distance = x * 6 

Return journey: Distance = (x + 12) * 4 

As the distance is the same in both cases, we can equate them: 

x * 6 = (x + 12) * 4 

6x = 4x + 48 

2x = 48 

x = 24 

So, the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is 24 km/hr. 

Distance = Speed x Time = 24 x 6 = 144 km 

Answer: Answer("B") 
Response 8:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep during the forward journey is "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, we have two equations:

d = s x 6   -----(1)  (since distance = speed x time)

d = (s + 12) x 4  -----(2)  (since distance = speed x time)

We can solve for "s" by equating equations (1) and (2):

s x 6 = (s + 12) x 4

6s = 4s + 48

2s = 48

s = 24 km/hr

Now we can substitute "s" into equation (1) to find "d":

d = s x 6 = 24 x 6 = 144 km

Therefore, the jeep travelled a distance of 144 km.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Solution:
Let the distance travelled by the jeep be "d" km.
Let the speed of the jeep during the forward journey be "s" km/hr.
During the return journey, the speed of the jeep is (s+12) km/hr.

We know that, 
Distance = Speed x Time

For the forward journey,
d = s x 6  ----(1)

For the return journey,
d = (s+12) x 4  ----(2)

From equation (1), we get s = d/6.
Substituting this value of s in equation (2), we get
d = (d/6 + 12) x 4
d = d/3 + 48
2d/3 = 48
d = 72 x 3
d = 216 km.

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 216 km.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 28
  C: 30
  D: 53
  E: 59
Response 0:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula. If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of water lilies after t days can be represented as 2^(t/2). 

We know that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies when there is one water lily initially. So, we can set up the following equation:

2^(60/2) = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824

This means that there will be 1,073,741,824 water lilies on the lake after 60 days when there is one water lily initially.

Now, let's find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if initially there were 64 water lilies on it. We can set up the following equation:

2^(t/2) = 1,073,741,824/64 = 16,777,216

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

t/2 = log2(16,777,216)
t/2 = 24

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

t = 48

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 48 days if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula: 
N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/k)
where N(t) is the number of water lilies at time t, N0 is the initial number of water lilies, k is the doubling time, and t is the time elapsed.

We know that N(60) = 2^30, since the number of water lilies doubles every two days for 60 days. We also know that N(0) = 64, since initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake. 

To find the doubling time k, we can use the formula:
2^k = 2
k = 1

Now we can solve for t:
N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/k)
2^6 = 64 * 2^(t/1)
2^(t/1) = 2^6
t/1 = 6
t = 6

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula. If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the growth factor is 2 and the time it takes to double is 2 days. Let's call the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies "t". 

Using the formula for exponential growth, we can write:

64 x 2^(t/2) = total number of water lilies on the lake

We know that when t = 60, the total number of water lilies on the lake is enough to cover the entire lake, so we can write:

64 x 2^(60/2) = total area of the lake

Simplifying this expression, we get:

64 x 2^30 = total area of the lake

Dividing both sides by 64, we get:

2^30 = total area of the lake / 64

Now we can use the formula for exponential growth again to solve for t:

64 x 2^(t/2) = total area of the lake

64 x 2^(t/2) = 64 x 2^30

2^(t/2) = 2^30

t/2 = 30

t = 60

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 60 days, regardless of the initial number of water lilies.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula: N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/k), where N0 is the initial number of water lilies, t is the time elapsed, k is the doubling time. We know that k = 2 days and N(60) = 2^30. We need to find t such that N(t) = 64. Substituting the values we get:
64 = N0 * 2^(t/2)
64/N0 = 2^(t/2)
2^(6/2) = 2^t/2
2^3 = 2^t/2
t/2 = 3
t = 6

Answer: Answer("A") 15
Response 4:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula: N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/k), where N(t) is the number of water lilies at time t, N0 is the initial number of water lilies, t is the time elapsed, and k is the doubling time. 

We know that when t=60, N(60) = 2^30. Therefore, we can solve for k as follows: 

2^30 = 1 * 2^(60/k)
2^30 = 2^(60/k)
30 = 60/k
k = 2

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the number of water lilies to reach 2^6 = 64. 

N(t) = 1 * 2^(t/2) = 64
2^(t/2) = 64
t/2 = 6
t = 12

Therefore, it takes 12 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if initially there were 64 water lilies on it. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies will double to reach the final number. If there is one water lily initially, and it doubles every two days, then after 60 days, the number of lilies will have doubled 30 times (since 60/2 = 30). 

Now, let's find out how many days it will take for 64 lilies to double 30 times. We can use the formula N = N0 x 2^t, where N is the final number of lilies, N0 is the initial number of lilies, and t is the number of times the number of lilies doubles. 

So, we have 64 x 2^30 = 1,073,741,824. This is the final number of lilies after 30 doublings. 

Therefore, it will take 30 x 2 = 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies will double to cover the lake. If there is one water lily initially and it doubles every two days, then after 60 days, the number of water lilies will be 2^30 (doubling 30 times). 

Now, if there are 64 water lilies initially, we need to find out how many times the number of water lilies will double to reach 2^30. 

2^30/64 = 2^(30-6) = 2^24

So, the number of times the number of water lilies will double is 24. Since each doubling takes 2 days, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 24*2 = 48 days.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") - The correct answer is not among the choices. The correct answer is 48.
Response 7:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula. If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of water lilies after t days is given by the formula 2^(t/2). We know that the lake is fully covered with water lilies after 60 days if there is one water lily initially. So we can write the equation 2^(60/2) = 2^30 = N, where N is the number of water lilies after 60 days if there is one water lily initially. 

Now we need to find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies. Let's call this number of days x. Then we can write the equation 2^(x/2) = 64 * 2^30. 

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 64: 2^((x/2) - 6) = 2^30. 

Now we can equate the exponents: (x/2) - 6 = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 60. 

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 60 days if initially there were 64 water lilies. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula. If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of water lilies after t days is given by:

N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/2)

where N0 is the initial number of water lilies and t is the time in days.

We know that N(60) = 2^30, since the lake is fully covered with water lilies after 60 days. We also know that N0 = 64, since initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake. Therefore, we can solve for t as follows:

N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/2)
2^30 = 64 * 2^(t/2)
2^(30 - 6) = 2^(t/2)
2^(24) = 2^(t/2)
t/2 = 24
t = 48

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies after 48 days.

Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies will double to cover the lake. If there is one water lily initially and it doubles every two days, then after 60 days it will double 30 times (since 60/2 = 30). 

Now, let's find out how many days it will take for 64 water lilies to double 30 times. We can use the formula N = N0 * 2^t, where N is the final number of water lilies, N0 is the initial number of water lilies, and t is the number of times the number of water lilies doubles. 

So, we have 64 * 2^30 = N, where N is the final number of water lilies. Solving for N, we get N = 1,073,741,824. 

Therefore, it will take 60 + 2t days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, where t is the number of times the number of water lilies doubles. We know that t = 30, so it will take 60 + 2*30 = 120 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Response 3:
Let the weight of the new heavy duty truck be x tons. 

The total weight of the 10 vehicles before the new truck was added is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons. 

After the new truck was added, the total weight became 11 * (12.2 + 2.6) = 157.2 tons. 

Therefore, the weight of the new truck is x = 157.2 - 122 = 35.2 tons.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let the weight of the new heavy duty truck be x tons. 

The total weight of the 10 vehicles before the new truck was added is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons. 

After the new truck was added, the total weight became (10 * 12.2) + x. 

The new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons. 

So we have the equation: 

(122 + x) / 11 = 14.8 

Solving for x: 

122 + x = 11 * 14.8 

122 + x = 162.8 

x = 40.8 

Therefore, the weight of the new heavy duty truck is 40.8 tons.

Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each daughter = 4x and the share of each son = 5x.

Total number of shares = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Sum of shares = Rs 8600

Therefore, x = 200

Hence, the share of each daughter = 4x = 4 * 200 = Rs 800

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each daughter = 4x and the share of each son = 5x.
Total number of shares = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.
Total amount = Rs 8600.
So, x = 8600/11.
Therefore, the share of each daughter = 4x = 4 * (8600/11) = Rs 3127.27 (approx).
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Let the share of each nephew be x. Then, the share of each daughter is 4x and the share of each son is 5x.

The total number of people who receive a share is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.

Therefore, we have:

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600

Simplifying this equation, we get:

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600

43x = 8600

x = 200

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let the share of each nephew be x. Then, the share of each daughter is 4x and the share of each son is 5x. 

Total number of people = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11

Total amount = Rs 8600

So, we have: 

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

33x = 8600

x = 260

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4(260) = Rs 1040.

So, each nephew receives Rs 200.

Each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800.

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let the amount received by each nephew be x.
Amount received by each daughter = 4x
Amount received by each son = 5x

Total number of children = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11

Total amount = Rs 8600

So, (5x * 5) + (4x * 4) + (2x * 1) = 8600
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200

Amount received by each daughter = 4x = 4 * 200 = Rs 800

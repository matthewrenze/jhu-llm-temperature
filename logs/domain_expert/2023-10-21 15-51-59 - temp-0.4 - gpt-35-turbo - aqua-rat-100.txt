### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. 75% of them take a winter vacation, which is 75 employees. 20% of them take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which is 20 employees. Hence, the remaining 5 employees take only a winter vacation or a summer vacation or both. 

40% of the employees take both a winter and a summer vacation, which is 40 employees. Therefore, the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 5 (total number of employees who take only a winter vacation or a summer vacation or both) - 40 (number of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation) = -35. 

Since we cannot have a negative number of employees, the answer is "None of the Above". 

The most likely answer is (A) 5%, which is the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation (without taking a winter vacation).
Response 1:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
- 75% of them take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation.
- 40% of them take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take a winter and a summer vacation.
- 20% of them take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

We need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. Let's represent this percentage by Q.

If we add up the percentages of employees who take a winter vacation and those who take a summer vacation, we get 100 - 20 = 80%. This means that 80 employees take either a winter or a summer vacation or both.

We know that 40 employees take both a winter and a summer vacation. So, the number of employees who take a summer vacation and also take a winter vacation is 75 - 40 = 35.

Therefore, the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 80 - 35 = 45.

So, Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

To find Q, we need to divide 45 by the total number of employees (100) and then multiply by 100%.

Q = (45/100) x 100% = 45%

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the total number of employees is 100.
Then we have:
- 75 employees take a winter vacation.
- 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations.
- 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacations.
We can use this information to find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation:
- The number of employees who take at least one vacation is 100 - 20 = 80.
- The number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations is 40.
- Therefore, the number of employees who take only a summer vacation is 80 - 40 = 40.
- This is 40% of the total number of employees.
So the answer is: Action: Answer("B") 15%.
Response 3:
Let W be the percentage of employees taking a winter vacation, S be the percentage taking a summer vacation, and N be the percentage taking neither. Then, we know that:
W = 75%
W + S - 40% = 25% (since 75% - 40% = 35% do not take a winter vacation)
W + S + N = 100%
Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:
75% + N = 100%
N = 25%
Substituting N into the second equation, we get:
75% + S - 40% = 25%
S = 15%
Therefore, the percentage of employees taking a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is:
S - (W + S - 40%) = 15% - (75% + 15% - 40%) = 15% - 50% = -35%
Since -35% is not a valid answer, the most likely answer is:
Action: Answer("A") 5%
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let W be the percent of employees who take a winter vacation, and S be the percent of employees who take a summer vacation. Then we have the following system of equations:

W + S - WS = 0.4 (40% take both vacations)
W + 0.2 = 0.75 (20% take neither vacation, and 75% take a winter vacation)
S - WS + 0.2 = Q (we want to find the percent who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation)

Solving for W and S, we get:

W = 0.55
S = 0.6

Substituting into the third equation, we get:

Q = S - WS + 0.2 = 0.6 - 0.33 + 0.2 = 0.47

So the answer is 47%, which is closest to choice (E) 45%. 

Action: Answer("E")

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
If 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, then 25% of the employees do not take a winter vacation.
If 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, then 80% of the employees take at least one vacation.
If 40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations, then 40% of the employees are counted twice in the previous 80%.
So, the percentage of employees who take at least one vacation is 80% - 40% = 40%.
Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is (100% - 75% - 20% - 40%) = 100% - 135% = -35%.
Since -35% is not a valid answer, the most likely answer is "None of the Above".

Topic: Math
Question: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 10
  C: 12
  D: 15
  E: 19
Response 0:
Let's assume that we need x helpers. Then, the total number of hours worked by all helpers will be 3x. 

In 1 hour, each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes. So, x helpers can make either 2x large cakes or 35x small cakes in 1 hour. 

We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in total. 

So, we can write two equations based on the above information: 

2x * 3x >= 20  (because we need to make at least 20 large cakes)
35x * 3x >= 700 (because we need to make at least 700 small cakes)

Solving these inequalities, we get: 

x >= 2.16 (for large cakes)
x >= 6.67 (for small cakes)

Since we need to have at least x helpers, we should choose the higher value, which is x = 7. 

Therefore, we need 7 helpers to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours. 

Answer: Answer("None of the above") (because the closest option is B: 10, but that is not the correct answer)
Response 1:
Let's assume that x helpers are required.
So, the number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 2 * x * 3 = 6x
The number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours = 35 * x * 3 = 105x
Now, we need to solve the following equations:
6x >= 20  (as 20 large cakes are needed)
105x >= 700 (as 700 small cakes are needed)
Solving the above equations, we get:
x >= 10/3 and x >= 20/3
So, x should be greater than or equal to the maximum of 10/3 and 20/3, which is 20/3.
Hence, we need at least 7 helpers, but as we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we need to round it up to the nearest integer.
Therefore, the answer is: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let the number of helpers required be x.
Then, the total number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours with x helpers = 2 * x * 3 = 6x
The total number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours with x helpers = 35 * x * 3 = 105x
To make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, we need x helpers such that:
6x >= 20 and 105x >= 700
Solving these inequalities, we get x >= 4 and x >= 6.67 (approx.)
So, the minimum number of helpers required is 7 (rounded up from 6.67).
Therefore, Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to make large cakes and y helpers are required to make small cakes. Then, we can set up the following system of equations:
2x + 35y = 20   (equation 1: total hours needed to make large cakes)
2x + 35y = 700  (equation 2: total hours needed to make small cakes)
We can solve for x and y by subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:
0x + 0y = 680
This means that there is no unique solution for x and y, and we cannot determine the number of helpers required. Therefore, the answer is "None of the above".
Response 4:
Let's assume that x helpers are required. Then, the number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours by x helpers is 2x*3=6x and the number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours by x helpers is 35x*3=105x. We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. So, we can write two equations as follows:

6x >= 20   (since one helper can make 2 large cakes in an hour, x helpers can make 6x large cakes in 3 hours)
105x >= 700  (since one helper can make 35 small cakes in an hour, x helpers can make 105x small cakes in 3 hours)

Solving these inequalities, we get:
x >= 10/3 and x >= 20/3
Therefore, x >= 20/3 = 6.67

Since we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to the nearest integer. Therefore, we need at least 7 helpers.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") - The closest answer is option A, but it is not the correct answer.
Response 5:
Let's assume that 'x' helpers are required to prepare the cakes.
So, the total number of hours available for preparation is 3 hours.
In 1 hour, each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes.
Therefore, x helpers can make either 2x large cakes or 35x small cakes in 1 hour.
So, in 3 hours, x helpers can make either 6x large cakes or 105x small cakes.
As per the question, 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes are needed.
Therefore, 6x >= 20 (large cakes) and 105x >= 700 (small cakes)
Solving these inequalities, we get x >= 10/3 and x >= 20/3
So, the minimum number of helpers required is 7. (rounded up from 6.66)
Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Let's assume that x helpers are required. Then, the number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours is 2x*3 = 6x and the number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours is 35x*3 = 105x. We can set up the following system of equations:

6x = 20  (since 20 large cakes are needed)
105x = 700  (since 700 small cakes are needed)

Solving for x, we get x = 10. Therefore, 10 helpers are required.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to prepare the cakes. 

In 1 hour, 1 helper can make:
- 2 large cakes OR
- 35 small cakes

In 3 hours, 1 helper can make:
- 6 large cakes OR
- 105 small cakes

Therefore, x helpers can make in 3 hours:
- 6x large cakes OR
- 105x small cakes

We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. So, we can set up two equations:
- 6x = 20  (to make 20 large cakes)
- 105x = 700 (to make 700 small cakes)

Solving these equations, we get:
- x = 10/3 helpers are needed to make 20 large cakes
- x = 20/3 helpers are needed to make 700 small cakes

Since we need to make both large and small cakes, we need to round up the number of helpers to the nearest integer. Therefore, we need:
- 4 helpers to make 20 large cakes
- 7 helpers to make 700 small cakes

Since we need more helpers to make small cakes, we need to select the answer based on the number of helpers required to make small cakes. So, 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
First, let's find out how many large cakes and small cakes can be made in 3 hours. 

One helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, one helper can make 6 large cakes. 

One helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, one helper can make 105 small cakes. 

To make 20 large cakes, we need 20/6 = 3.33 helpers. Round it up to 4 helpers. 

To make 700 small cakes, we need 700/105 = 6.67 helpers. Round it up to 7 helpers. 

Therefore, we need a total of 4+7=11 helpers. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to complete the task.

In 1 hour, a helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes.
Therefore, in 3 hours, a helper can make either 6 large cakes or 105 small cakes.
So, x helpers can make either 6x large cakes or 105x small cakes in 3 hours.

We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
So, 6x >= 20 and 105x >= 700.

Solving the above equations, we get x >= 10/3 and x >= 20/3.

Therefore, x >= 7.

So, we need at least 7 helpers to complete the task.

Action: Answer("None of the above") - The closest answer is A: 8, but we need at least 7 helpers, not 8.

To find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we can use the formula:

number of books that are both = number of hardcover books + number of fiction books - total number of books

Plugging in the values, we get:

number of books that are both = 30 + 20 - 45 = 5

Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 5.

Question: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
Choices:
  A: 4,000
  B: 4,200
  C: 4,500
  D: 4,800
  E: 5,000
Response 0:
Let's assume that the total number of staplers produced on Monday is "x". 

10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, which means 90% of the staplers produced were non-defective. 

2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, which means 98% of the non-defective staplers were not rejected. 

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So, 

0.02 * (0.9 * x) = 72 

Solving for "x", we get: 

x = 4000 

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4,000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the total number of staplers produced on Monday was x. Then, the number of defective staplers produced is 0.1x and the number of non-defective staplers produced is 0.9x. 

Out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected, which is 0.02 times 0.9x, or 0.018x. We know that 72 staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation:

0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 72/0.018 = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the factory produced "x" number of staplers on Monday. 

10% of the staplers were defective, so the number of defective staplers produced that day was 0.1x. 

The remaining staplers (0.9x) were non-defective. 

2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected, which means that 0.02(0.9x) = 72 staplers were rejected. 

Solving for x: 

0.02(0.9x) = 72 

0.018x = 72 

x = 4000 

Therefore, the factory produced 4000 staplers on Monday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let the total number of staplers produced be x. 
The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced = 90% of x = 0.9x
The number of non-defective staplers rejected = 2% of the non-defective staplers = 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x
We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so:
0.018x = 72
x = 4000
Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day was 4000.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's assume the total number of staplers produced is "x". 

The number of defective staplers produced on Monday is 10% of x, which is 0.1x. 

Therefore, the number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday is 0.9x. 

Out of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. We know that 72 staplers were rejected, so we can set up the following equation:

0.02(0.9x) = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day was 4000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let x be the total number of staplers produced on Monday. 

The number of defective staplers produced is 10% of x, which is 0.1x. 

The number of non-defective staplers produced is 90% of x, which is 0.9x. 

2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected, which is 0.02 * 0.9x = 0.018x. 

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation: 

0.018x = 72 

Solving for x: 

x = 4000 

Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day was 4000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let's assume the total number of staplers produced on Monday was "x". 

The number of defective staplers produced on Monday = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday = 90% of x = 0.9x

Out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. This means, 

0.02 * 0.9x = 72
0.018x = 72
x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day was 4,000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let's assume the total number of staplers produced on Monday was x.
The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced = 90% of x = 0.9x

Now, 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.
So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 2% of 0.9x = 0.018x

We know that the number of non-defective staplers rejected was 72.
So, 0.018x = 72
x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day was 4000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's assume that the factory produced x staplers on Monday. 

Then, the number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x. 

So, the number of non-defective staplers produced = x - 0.1x = 0.9x. 

Now, 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. 

So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 2% of 0.9x = 0.018x. 

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. 

So, 0.018x = 72. 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 4000. 

Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day was 4000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let's assume that the total number of staplers produced was x. Then, the number of defective staplers produced would be 0.1x and the number of non-defective staplers produced would be 0.9x. 

Out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. This means that the number of rejected non-defective staplers is (2/100) * 0.9x = 0.018x. We know that this number is equal to 72, so we can write:

0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4,000

Therefore, the total number of staplers produced that day was 4,000.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 

We know that P(at least one of A or B occurs) = P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). 

Substituting the values we know, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let P(B) = x. Then, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + x - 0.6x. 

Given that P(A or B) = 0.96, we have:

0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x
0.36 = 0.4x
x = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.
We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A U B) = 0.96.
Since A and B are independent, we have P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B).
We can rearrange this equation to solve for P(B):
P(B) = (P(A U B) - P(A)) / (1 - P(A ∩ B))
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) (since A and B are independent)
Substituting the given values, we get:
P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6 * P(B))
Solving for P(B), we get:
P(B) = 0.8
Therefore, the answer is (D) 0.8.
Response 3:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.

We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96.

Since A and B are independent, we have P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).

Substituting the given values, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 4:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. 

We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. 

Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula: 

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) 

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B) 

Substituting the given values, we get: 

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 x P(B)) 

Simplifying, we get: 

0.36 = 0.4P(B) 

P(B) = 0.9 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Then, we know that:

P(A) = 0.6
P(A or B) = 0.96

Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Substituting the given values, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.4P(B) = 0.36
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring. Since events A and B are independent, the probability of both events occurring is P(A) * P(B). The probability of at least one of the events occurring is the sum of the probabilities of each event minus the probability of both events occurring (since that would be counted twice). Therefore, we have:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 7:
Let P(B) = x. Then, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + x - 0.6x. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6x. We can now solve for x: 

0.6 + x - 0.6x = 0.96  
0.4x = 0.36  
x = 0.9  

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. 

We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. 

Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), where P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) because A and B are independent. 

Substituting the given values, we get: 

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

0.36 = 0.4P(B) 

P(B) = 0.9 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B). 

We know that P(A) = 0.6, so P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.4. 

The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is equal to 1 - P(neither A nor B) = 1 - P(not A) x P(not B). 

We can substitute P(not A) = 0.4 into the above equation to get: 

1 - 0.4 x P(not B) = 0.96 

Solving for P(not B), we get: 

P(not B) = 0.6 

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B) = 0.6 x P(B). 

We can substitute P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B) = 0.6 x P(B) into the equation: 

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) 

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 x P(B) 

0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 x P(B) 

0.36 = 0.4 x P(B) 

P(B) = 0.9

Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
Choices:
  A: 80
  B: 120
  C: 240
  D: 320
  E: 360
Response 0:
Let's start by finding out how many golf balls the store sold. 

80% of 600 = 0.8 x 600 = 480

We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, so the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the initial number of white golf balls in stock. Let's call this number "w". 

The total number of golf balls sold is equal to the number of yellow golf balls sold plus the number of white golf balls sold: 

480 = y + w

We also know that the number of yellow golf balls sold is equal to the number of white golf balls sold, so: 

y = w

Substituting y = w into the first equation: 

480 = 2w 

w = 240 

So the store had 240 white golf balls and 240 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the store had y yellow golf balls and w white golf balls at the beginning of the day. We know that y + w = 600. 

We also know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, which means it sold 480 golf balls (0.8 x 600 = 480). 

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and sold all of its white golf balls, we know that the number of white golf balls sold is w. Therefore, the number of yellow golf balls sold is also w. 

We can set up an equation: 

w + w = 480 

Simplifying: 

2w = 480 

w = 240 

So the store had 240 white golf balls and 360 yellow golf balls (y = 600 - w = 360) at the beginning of the day. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the store had y yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it also had y white golf balls. The total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day was 600, so we can write an equation:

y + y = 600

Simplifying the equation:

2y = 600

y = 300

So the store had 300 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

Since the store sold 80% of its inventory, it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it must have sold 240 yellow golf balls. Therefore, the store had 300 - 240 = 60 yellow golf balls remaining at the end of the day.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let's assume that the store had x yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it also had x white golf balls at the beginning of the day. 

The total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day was 600, so: 

x + x = 600 

2x = 600 

x = 300 

So the store had 300 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. 

Since the store sold 80% of its inventory, it sold 0.8*600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, and sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it must have sold 240 yellow golf balls. 

Therefore, the store had 300 yellow golf balls - 240 yellow golf balls sold = 60 yellow golf balls left at the end of the day. 

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's start by finding the total number of golf balls sold. If 80% of the inventory was sold, then the number of golf balls sold is 0.8 * 600 = 480.

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and it sold all of its white golf balls, then the number of white golf balls sold is the same as the initial number of white golf balls in stock. Therefore, the initial number of white golf balls in stock is 480 / 2 = 240.

If the store had 600 golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day, and 240 of them were white, then the remaining 360 must have been yellow.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let's first find out how many golf balls the store sold during the day. If the store had 600 golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day, and sold 80% of them, then the store sold 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and sold all of its white golf balls, then the store sold 240 white golf balls. This means that the store had 240 yellow golf balls in stock at the end of the day. Therefore, the store had 600 - 240 = 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let's call the number of yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day "Y". We know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, so it sold 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls. We also know that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and it sold all of its white golf balls. This means that the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day was equal to the number of yellow golf balls it sold. So, the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day was also "Y". 

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it must have sold Y yellow golf balls as well. Therefore, the total number of golf balls the store sold was 2Y. We know that this is equal to 480, so we can write the equation:

2Y = 480

Solving for Y, we get:

Y = 240

Therefore, the store had 240 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
Choices:
  A: $8
  B: $10
  C: $13.6
  D: $22.9
  E: $40
Response 0:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price of each article decreased by 15%, the new price of each article = x - 0.15x = 0.85x
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the new total cost = $300 + $5x
According to the question, the new total cost = the cost of 5 more articles at the new price
i.e., $300 + $5x = 5(0.85x)
Solving the above equation, we get x = 16
Therefore, the new selling price of each article = 0.85x = 0.85(16) = $13.6

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x.
Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so:
5(0.85x) = $300
4.25x = $300
x = $70
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:
0.85x = 0.85($70) = $59.5
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") [The closest answer is (C) $13.6, but that is not correct in this case.]
Response 2:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
15% of x is 0.15x.
So the new price of each article is x - 0.15x = 0.85x.
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the new price of 5 articles is $300.
Therefore, 0.85x * 5 = $300.
Solving for x, we get x = $70.
So the new selling price of each article is 0.85x = 0.85 * 70 = $59.5.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") 

Note: None of the choices match the correct answer which is $59.5.
Response 3:
Let the original price of each article be x. After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x. 

Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles decreased by 5x. 

We can set up an equation: 

5x = 300 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 60 

So the original price of each article was $60. 

The new price of each article is 0.85x: 

0.85(60) = 51 

Anna can now buy 5 more articles for $300, so the new selling price of each article is: 

(300 + 5(51)) / 10 = 33 

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is $33. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Solution:
Let the original selling price of each article be x.
After decreasing the price by 15%, the new selling price of each article is (100% - 15%)x = 0.85x.
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of 5 articles is $300.
Therefore, 5 * 0.85x = $300.
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
x = $70.
Hence, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x = 0.85 * 70 = $59.5.
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") [The answer should be $59.5, which is not one of the available choices. The closest answer is (C) $13.6, but that is incorrect.]
Response 5:
Solution:
Let the original selling price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new selling price of each article is:
x - 0.15x = 0.85x
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so she originally planned to buy (5 + 5) = 10 articles.
The total cost of buying 10 articles at the original selling price is:
10x
The total cost of buying 10 articles at the new selling price is:
10(0.85x) = 8.5x
We know that Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so we can set up the following equation:
8.5x - 10x = 300
-1.5x = 300
x = -200
This is not a possible solution, so we made a mistake somewhere.
However, we can use the answer choices to our advantage.
We know that the new selling price of each article is less than the original selling price of each article, so we can eliminate choices D and E.
We also know that the new selling price of each article is greater than $8, so we can eliminate choice A.
We are left with choices B and C.
Let's try choice B:
If the new selling price of each article is $10, then the total cost of buying 10 articles at the new selling price is:
10($10) = $100
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of buying 15 articles at the new selling price is:
15($10) = $150
This is $150 - $100 = $50 more than what Anna originally planned to spend, which means that choice B is not correct.
Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Solution: 

Let's assume the original price of each article was x. 

After the 15% discount, the new price of each article is: 

x - 0.15x = 0.85x 

Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so: 

5(0.85x) = $300 

4.25x = $300 

x = $70 

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is: 

0.85x = 0.85($70) = $59.5 

Answer: Answer("None of the above") 

Note: None of the given choices match the calculated answer of $59.5.
Response 7:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is:
x - 0.15x = 0.85x
Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, so:
5(0.85x) = $300
4.25x = $300
x = $70
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:
0.85x = 0.85($70) = $59.5

Answer: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Solution:
Let's assume the original price of each article was "x".
After the price of each article decreased by 15%, the new price of each article will be:
x - 0.15x = 0.85x
So, the total cost of buying "n" articles at the new price will be:
0.85nx
According to the problem, Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 at the new price. So, we can write the following equation:
0.85(x+5)5 = 300
Solving for "x", we get:
x = 10
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:
0.85x = 0.85(10) = $8.50
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") [The closest answer is (A) $8, but the correct answer is $8.50]
Response 9:
Solution: 

Let the original price of each article be x. 

After the 15% decrease, the new price of each article is 0.85x. 

Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, so: 

5x - 5(0.85x) = $300 

Simplifying: 

5x - 4.25x = $300 

0.75x = $300 

x = $400 

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is: 

0.85($400) = $340 

Action: Answer("None of the above")

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 1120
  C: 792
  D: 1320
  E: 1200
Response 0:
Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively.
When folded along the length, we get two parts of dimensions l/2 and b. Their perimeters add up to 48cm.
2(l/2 + b) = 48
l + 2b = 48
When folded along the breadth, we get two parts of dimensions l and b/2. Their perimeters add up to 66cm.
2(l + b/2) = 66
2l + b = 66
Solving the above two equations, we get l = 24 and b = 18.
Area of the rectangular sheet = l * b = 24 * 18 = 432 sq.cm.
Action: Answer("None of the above")  # The correct answer is not among the choices. The correct answer is 432.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let's assume the length of the rectangle is "l" and the width is "w". When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm, which means the length of each part is 24cm. Similarly, when folded along the width, the perimeter of each part is 66cm, which means the width of each part is 33cm. 

We can now create two equations based on the information given:
2l + 2w = 48
2w + 2(2l) = 66

Simplifying these equations, we get:
l + w = 24
2l + w = 33

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:
l = 9
w = 15

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is lw = 9 x 15 = 135 square cm.

Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's assume that the length of the rectangular sheet is l and its breadth is b. 

When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. That means, the length of each part is 24cm (as there are two parts). So, we can write:

2b + 2(24) = 48
2b = 48 - 48
b = 0

This is not possible as the breadth cannot be zero. So, we need to consider the other set of sides.

When folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. That means, the breadth of each part is 33cm. So, we can write:

2l + 2(33) = 66
2l = 66 - 66
l = 0

Again, this is not possible as the length cannot be zero. So, there must be some mistake in the question.

Since none of the choices match, we can select "None of the Above" as the answer.

Question: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.
Choices:
  A: 2 miles
  B: 2.25 miles
  C: 3.25 miles
  D: 3.85 miles
  E: 2.85 miles
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time

On a normal day, Bill's rate is 15 mph. However, on a windy day, his rate is reduced by 4 mph, so his rate becomes 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

We want to find the distance he can travel in 21 minutes, which is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

So, distance = rate x time = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Distance = speed x time

Distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours

Distance = 3.85 miles

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours: 

21 minutes * (1 hour / 60 minutes) = 0.35 hours

On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed is 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph. 

Now we can use the formula: distance = rate * time 

distance = 11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
On a normal day, Bill rides at 15 mph. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. So, his speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph. 

We need to find how far Bill can travel in 21 minutes, which is 0.35 hours (21/60). 

Distance = Speed x Time 

Distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours 

Distance = 3.85 miles (rounded to the nearest hundredth)

Question: In a bag of red and green sweets, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, how many red sweets are there?
Choices:

  B: 80
  C: 95
  D: 100
  E: 85
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding the total number of sweets in the bag. Since the ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4, the total ratio is 3+4=7. This means that for every 7 sweets in the bag, 3 are red and 4 are green. 

To find the total number of sweets, we can set up a proportion: 

4/7 = 120/x 

where x is the total number of sweets in the bag. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

4x = 7 * 120 

4x = 840 

x = 210 

So there are 210 sweets in the bag. 

Now we can use the ratio of red to green sweets to find the number of red sweets: 

3/7 = r/210 

where r is the number of red sweets. 

To solve for r, we can cross-multiply: 

3 * 210 = 7r 

630 = 7r 

r = 90 

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's start by finding the number of green sweets per unit of the ratio:
- 4 units of the ratio represent 120 green sweets
- 1 unit of the ratio represents 120/4 = 30 green sweets

Now, we can use the ratio to find the number of red sweets:
- The ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4
- This means for every 3 units of red sweets, there are 4 units of green sweets
- So, for every 3+4=7 units of the ratio, there are 4 units of green sweets
- 4 units of the ratio represent 120 green sweets, so 7 units of the ratio represent 120*(7/4) = 210 red sweets

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("A") 90.
Response 5:
Let the number of red sweets be 3x and the number of green sweets be 4x. We know that 4x = 120, so x = 30. Therefore, there are 3x = 3(30) = 90 red sweets.

Response 9:
Let the number of red sweets be 3x. Then the number of green sweets is 4x. We are given that 4x = 120, so x = 30. Therefore, the number of red sweets is 3x = 3(30) = 90.

Question: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
Response 0:
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to find a number that satisfies both conditions (20% took physics and 28% took math).

Let x be the total number of students in the school. Then, we can write the following equations:

- 0.2x = number of students who took physics
- 0.28x = number of students who took math

Since we want the least possible value of x, we can assume that all the students who took physics also took math. In other words, the number of students who took math is a subset of the number of students who took physics. Therefore, we can write:

- number of students who took math ≤ number of students who took physics

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

- 0.28x ≤ 0.2x
- 0.08x ≤ 0
- x ≥ 0/0.08
- x ≥ 0

Since x has to be a positive integer (we can't have a negative or fractional number of students), the least possible value of x is 1. However, this is not a valid answer since the question states that there are more than 501 students in the school. Therefore, we need to find the next possible value of x that satisfies both conditions.

The only answer choice that is greater than 501 and satisfies both conditions is A: 550.

Response 9:
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we can assume that all the students who took physics also took math. This way, we can find the minimum number of students that satisfies both conditions.

Let x be the total number of students in the school.
According to the given information, 20% of x took physics and 28% of x took math.
If all the students who took physics also took math, then the total number of students who took physics or math is:
20% of x + (28% - 20%) of x = 20% of x + 8% of x = 28% of x

We know that the total number of students who took physics or math is more than 501.
So, we can write the inequality:
28% of x > 501

Solving for x, we get:
x > 501 / 0.28
x > 1796.43

The least possible integer value of x that satisfies this inequality is 1797.

Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month * 12 months/year * $110/unit = $554,400

To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue must be:
Yearly revenue = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component, we can set up the following equation:
420x = $1,180,800
where x is the selling price per component.

Solving for x, we get:
x = $1,180,800 / 420 = $280

Response 1:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost: 

Yearly production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months/year = $554,400/year

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to use the following formula:

Minimum selling price = (Yearly production cost + Yearly profit) / Total units produced per year

We know the yearly production cost is $554,400 and we want a yearly profit of at least $626,400, so:

Minimum selling price = ($554,400 + $626,400) / (420 units/month x 12 months/year) = $260/unit

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let x be the selling price per component. 
The revenue from selling one component is x dollars.
The profit from selling one component is (x-110) dollars.
The yearly profit is 12 times the profit from selling one component, so it is 12(x-110) dollars.
We want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400, so we have the inequality:
12(x-110) >= 626400
Simplifying this inequality, we get:
x >= 52100/210
x >= 248
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $248.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Let's start by finding the yearly production cost of the company. 

Yearly production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months = $554,400

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to use the following formula:

Minimum selling price = (Yearly production cost + Yearly profit) / Total units produced per year

Total units produced per year = 420 units/month x 12 months = 5,040 units

Substituting the values in the formula, we get:

Minimum selling price = ($554,400 + $626,400) / 5,040 = $240

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $240.

Response 4:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost of the company:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months = $554,400

To make a profit of at least $626,400, the yearly revenue from sales should be:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + Yearly profit = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

So, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly revenue of $1,180,800 is:
Minimum selling price = Yearly revenue / Yearly units produced
Minimum selling price = $1,180,800 / (420 units/month x 12 months) = $233.33

The closest answer choice to $233.33 is choice A: 226. Therefore, 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost: 

420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months/year = $554,400/year

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit to be at least $626,400, we need to set up an equation: 

yearly profit = (selling price - production cost) * number of units sold per year 

We know the number of units sold per year is: 

420 units/month * 12 months/year = 5,040 units/year 

Substituting the values we have: 

$626,400 = (selling price - $110) * 5,040 

Solving for selling price: 

selling price = ($626,400 / 5,040) + $110 

selling price = $230 

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit to be at least $626,400 is $230.

Response 6:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months = $554,400

To make a profit of at least $626,400, the yearly revenue from sales should be:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + $626,400 = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced in a year:
Minimum selling price = Yearly revenue / Number of components produced in a year
Number of components produced in a year = 420 units/month x 12 months = 5,040 units

Minimum selling price = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

$1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let the minimum selling price per component be x. 

The revenue from selling one component is x dollars. 

The profit from selling one component is (x - 110) dollars. 

The profit from selling 420 components is 420(x - 110) dollars. 

The yearly profit from selling 420 components every month is 12(420)(x - 110) dollars. 

We want this to be at least $626,400: 

12(420)(x - 110) >= 626400 

Simplifying, we get: 

x >= 260 

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $260.

Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
We can start by using the information given in the problem to write an equation: 

x = m/100 * 4y 

We want to express m as a percentage of x. To do this, we need to isolate m in the equation above and then express m as a percentage of x. 

x = m/100 * 4y 

x / (4y) = m/100 

100 * (x / (4y)) = m 

m = 25 * (x / y) 

So m is 25 times x/y, which means that m is (25 * x/y)% of x. 

Answer: Answer("E") 5000/y
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
To solve the problem, we can start by writing the equation for x in terms of m and y:

x = (m/100) * 4y

Next, we can solve for m in terms of x and y:

m = (100x) / (4y)

Finally, we can express m as a percentage of x in terms of y:

m = (100x) / (4y) * (1/x) * 100%
m = 2500/y

Therefore, the answer is D: 2500/y.

  D: 60
  E: 120
Response 0:
We can start by using the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Action: Answer("E") 

To convert hours to minutes, we need to multiply by 60. 

So, time = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour = 4 hours = 4 x 60 minutes = 240 minutes.
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Action: Answer("E") 

Explanation: 
time = distance / speed = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour = 4 hours = 4 x 60 minutes = 240 minutes.
Response 2:
We can use the formula `distance = rate x time` to solve this problem. We want to find the time it takes to travel 48 miles at a rate of 12 miles per hour. 

First, we can rearrange the formula to solve for time: `time = distance / rate`. 

Plugging in the values, we get: `time = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour = 4 hours`. 

However, the question asks for the time in minutes, so we need to convert 4 hours to minutes. 

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so: `4 hours x 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes`. 

Therefore, the answer is:

  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's start by finding the total profit earned by A and B before C joined the business. 

Let the time period for which A invested be x months. Then, B invested for (12 - 2 - x) = (10 - x) months.

Now, we can calculate their profit share as follows:
Profit of A = (40000 * x)/12
Profit of B = (60000 * (10 - x))/12

Total profit of A and B = (40000 * x)/12 + (60000 * (10 - x))/12 = (200000 + 20000x)/60

Now, we can find the time period for which C invested using the following equation:
Profit of C = (120000 * (12 - x - 2))/12 = (120000 * (10 - x))/12 = (1000000 - 100000x)/12

Total profit of A, B, and C = (200000 + 20000x)/60 + (1000000 - 100000x)/12 = 375000

Simplifying the above equation, we get:
x = 6

Therefore, A invested for 6 months and B invested for (10 - 6) = 4 months before C joined the business.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's first calculate the total investment made by A and B before C joined the business.
A invested Rs. 40,000 for 12 months = Rs. 480,000
B invested Rs. 60,000 for 10 months (since he joined after 2 months) = Rs. 600,000

Total investment before C joined = Rs. 1,080,000

Let's assume C joined after x months.
So, C invested Rs. 120,000 for (12 - x) months.

Now, let's calculate the profit share of A and B.
Let A's profit share be P.
Then, B's profit share = (375000 - 150000 - P)

Now, we can write the equation:
P/1080000 = (375000 - 150000 - P)/1200000

Solving this equation, we get P = Rs. 75,000

So, A's profit share = Rs. 75,000
B's profit share = Rs. 150,000 - Rs. 75,000 = Rs. 75,000

Now, we can write another equation based on C's profit share:
C's profit share/1200000 = (375000 - 150000)/1200000

Solving this equation, we get C's profit share = Rs. 150,000

Now, we can write another equation based on C's investment:
C's investment*(12-x)/1080000 = 150000/1200000

Solving this equation, we get x = 4 months.

Therefore, C joined the business 4 months after B joined.

Question: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 62
  C: 82
  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Let's solve this problem using algebra. 

Let x be the first integer, then the sum of k consecutive integers can be expressed as:
x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1)

Since the least integer is -50, we know that x = -50. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:
-50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51

Simplifying this equation, we get:
k(2*(-50) + k - 1) = 2*51

Simplifying further, we get:
k^2 - 99k + 102 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:
k = (99 ± sqrt(99^2 - 4*102))/2
k = (99 ± sqrt(9801 - 408))/2
k = (99 ± sqrt(9393))/2
k ≈ 2.52 or k ≈ 96.48

Since k has to be a positive integer, the only possible value is k = 96.

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's solve the problem by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: S = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d), where S is the sum of the sequence, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.

We know that the first term is -50, and we want to find the number of terms, k. Let's call the second term a+1, the third term a+2, and so on, up to a+k-1.

The sum of the k consecutive integers is 51, so we can write an equation:

51 = k/2 * (-50 + (-50 + k - 1))

Simplifying the right-hand side:

51 = k/2 * (-100 + k)

102 = k^2 - 100k

k^2 - 100k - 102 = 0

We can solve for k using the quadratic formula:

k = (100 ± sqrt(100^2 - 4(1)(-102))) / 2
k = (100 ± sqrt(10004)) / 2
k = (100 ± 100.02) / 2

We can discard the negative solution, since we're looking for a positive number of terms:

k = (100 + 100.02) / 2
k ≈ 100

Therefore, the answer is (E) 102.
Response 2:
Let's solve the problem using algebraic equations.

Let x be the first integer, then the sum of the k consecutive integers is:
x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1)

Since the least integer is -50, we know that x = -50, so:
-50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
k(-50) + (1+2+3+...+k-1) = 51

Using the formula for the sum of the first k-1 positive integers, we get:
k(-50) + (k-1)(k-1+1)/2 = 51
-50k + k^2/2 - k/2 + 1/2 = 51
k^2/2 - 101k/2 + 25 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:
k = (101 ± sqrt(101^2 - 4(1/2)(25)(2))) / (2(1/2))
k = (101 ± sqrt(101^2 - 200)) / 2
k = (101 ± sqrt(10121)) / 2

Since k must be a positive integer, we take the positive root:
k = (101 + sqrt(10121)) / 2 ≈ 40.98

Therefore, the closest integer value of k is 41, so the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
First, we can use the formula for the sum of consecutive integers: sum = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. 

In this case, we know that a = -50 and the sum is 51. We don't know n or d yet. 

We can simplify the formula to: sum = (n/2)(2a + nd - d) = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d) = 51

Plugging in the values we know: 51 = (k/2)(-100 + (k-1))d

Simplifying: 102 = k(2-k+d)

We also know that the k consecutive integers start with -50, so the last integer is (-50 + k - 1). 

We can use this to find d: d = [(last term) - (first term)] / (k - 1) = [(-50 + k - 1) - (-50)] / (k - 1) = (k - 1) / (k - 1) = 1

Now we can substitute d = 1 into the equation we got earlier: 102 = k(2-k+1) = k(3-k)

Expanding: 102 = 3k - k^2

Rearranging: k^2 - 3k + 102 = 0

Using the quadratic formula: k = (3 ± sqrt(3^2 - 4(1)(102))) / 2 = (3 ± sqrt(405)) / 2

Since k has to be a positive integer, we can discard the negative root. 

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let's solve this problem using algebra. 

Let x be the first integer, then the sum of k consecutive integers can be expressed as:
x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1)

We know that the least integer is -50, so x = -50. Substituting this value, we get:
-50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
k*(-50) + (1+2+...+(k-1)) = 51

Using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, we can simplify further:
k*(-50) + (k-1)*(k-1)/2 = 51
-100k + k^2 - k + 1 = 102
k^2 - 101k + 103 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:
k = (101 ± sqrt(101^2 - 4*1*103))/2
k = (101 ± sqrt(10009))/2
k = (101 ± 317)/2

Since k has to be a positive integer, we take the positive root:
k = (101 + 317)/2 = 209/2 = 104.5

However, k has to be an integer, so the answer is none of the above.

Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let's solve this problem using algebra. 

Let x be the first integer, then the kth integer is x + (k-1). 

The sum of k consecutive integers is given by the formula: 

sum = (k/2) * (first integer + last integer)

Substituting the given values, we get: 

51 = (k/2) * (-50 + (x + k - 1))

Simplifying, we get: 

102 = k * (x + k - 51)

Since we know that x = -50, we can substitute that in the equation: 

102 = k * (-50 + k - 51)

102 = k * (k - 101)

k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0

Solving for k using the quadratic formula, we get: 

k = 2 or k = 99

Since we are looking for a positive value of k, the answer is:

Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
Response 0:
Let the original side of the square piece of cloth be x. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x. The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. 

Cutting the rectangular piece diagonally in half creates two right triangles, each with legs x-4 and x, and area 70 sq ft. So we have:

(1/2)(x-4)(x) = 70

Multiplying both sides by 2 and dividing by x-4, we get:

x = 14 + 8/(x-4)

Since x is the side of a square, it must be positive. Therefore, x-4 > 0, or x > 4. 

We can use the equation above to iteratively approximate x. Starting with x=8 (which satisfies x>4), we get:

x = 14.25
x = 14.2857
x = 14.2872
x = 14.2873

So x is approximately 14.2873 feet. The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x, which is approximately 57.1492 feet. 

Therefore, the best answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. When we trim 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. 

We can find the area of the rectangular piece as (x-4)*x = x^2 - 4x. 

When we cut the rectangular piece diagonally, we get two triangles. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, A = (1/2)bh, where b is the base and h is the height. 

Since we cut the rectangle diagonally, the base and height of each triangle are the same as the sides of the square piece of cloth. Let's call this side length y. 

So, we have (1/2)*y*(x-4) = 70. Simplifying this equation, we get y*(x-4) = 140. 

Now, we can solve for y in terms of x: y = 140/(x-4). 

We know that the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x. We can substitute y = 140/(x-4) into this expression to get the perimeter in terms of x: 

4x = 2y + 2(x-4) + 2x
4x = 2(140/(x-4)) + 4x - 8
140/(x-4) = 4
x-4 = 35
x = 39

Therefore, the original side length of the square piece of cloth was 39 feet, and the perimeter was 4x = 156 feet. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. After trimming 4 feet from one of the edges, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. 

The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. Therefore, 

(1/2) * (x-4) * h = 70, where h is the height of the triangle. 

Solving for h, we get h = 140/(x-4). 

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the value of x. 

x^2 = (x-4)^2 + (140/(x-4))^2 

Simplifying this equation, we get x^4 - 8x^3 + 8x^2 + 44800 = 0. 

This equation can be factored as (x^2 - 4x - 280)(x^2 - 4x + 1600) = 0. 

The second factor gives us imaginary roots, which are not valid in this context. Therefore, we can solve for x using the first factor: 

x^2 - 4x - 280 = 0 

(x-20)(x+14) = 0 

x = 20 (since x cannot be negative) 

Therefore, the original piece of cloth was a square with side length 20 feet. The perimeter of this square is 4 * 20 = 80 feet. 

But we trimmed 4 feet from one edge to form a rectangle. Therefore, the perimeter of the original piece of cloth was 80 + 16 = 96 feet. 

Answer: Answer("None of the Above") - The correct answer is 96.
Response 3:
Let's assume that the original side of the square cloth is x feet. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x. The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. 

Since the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles, the area of each triangle is (1/2)*[(x-4)*x]/2 = 70. Simplifying this equation, we get:

(x^2 - 4x)/4 = 70
x^2 - 4x = 280
x^2 - 4x - 280 = 0

We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:
x = [4 ± sqrt(4^2 - 4(1)(-280))]/2
x = [4 ± sqrt(1124)]/2
x = 2 ± sqrt(281)

Since x represents the length of one side of the square cloth, the perimeter of the original piece of cloth is 4x. Therefore, the perimeter is:

4x = 4(2 + sqrt(281)) = 8 + 4sqrt(281)

So the answer is Action: Answer("E") 
Response 4:
Let's assume that the original piece of cloth had side length x. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangle become (x-4) by x. 

The area of the rectangle is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. 

When the rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles, each triangle has base (x-4) and height x (the diagonal of the rectangle). So the area of each triangle is (1/2)(x-4)(x) = 70. 

Solving for x, we get x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0. Factoring, we get (x-14)(x+10) = 0. Since x must be positive, we have x = 14. 

Therefore, the original piece of cloth had side length 14 feet, and its perimeter was 4x = 56 feet. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. After trimming 4 feet from one side, the new rectangle has dimensions (x-4) by x. 
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the diagonal of the rectangle:
diagonal^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2
diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
diagonal = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)

Since the rectangle is cut into two triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet, we can set up the following equation:
(1/2) * (x-4) * h = 70
h = 140 / (x-4)

Now we can use the fact that the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle plus 4 times the square root of 2 times the length of one of the triangles' base:
Perimeter = 2(x-4) + 2x + 4sqrt(2)*diagonal/2
Perimeter = 2x - 8 + 2x + 4sqrt(2)*sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)/2
Perimeter = 4x - 8 + 4sqrt(2)*sqrt(x^2 - 4x + 4)

Simplifying this expression and plugging in h = 140 / (x-4), we get:
Perimeter = 4x + 560 / sqrt(x^2 - 4x + 4) - 8

To find the value of x that minimizes the perimeter, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to x and set it equal to 0:
d(Perimeter)/dx = 4 - (560/2)*((x^2 - 4x + 4)^(-3/2))*(2x - 4) = 0
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x - 4 = sqrt(x^2 - 4x + 4)
4x^2 - 24x + 28 = 0
x^2 - 6x + 7 = 0
(x-1)(x-7) = 0
x = 1 or x = 7

Since x represents the side length of the original square piece of cloth, we can eliminate the solution x = 1 (which would result in a negative length for the rectangle). Therefore, x = 7, and the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is:
Perimeter = 4x + 560 / sqrt(x^2 - 4x + 4) - 8
Perimeter = 4(7) + 560 / sqrt(7^2 - 4(7) + 4) - 8
Perimeter = 28 + 560 / sqrt(33) - 8
Perimeter = 20 + 560 / sqrt(33)
Perimeter ≈ 62.24

Therefore, the closest answer choice is D: 62.
Response 6:
Let's assume that the original square piece of cloth had a side length of x feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the length of the rectangular piece becomes x-4 feet and the width remains x feet. When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, two right triangles are formed. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. 

We know that the area of a triangle is given by the formula (1/2) * base * height. Since both triangles are identical, we can set up the following equation: 

(1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0 

Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get: 

x = 14 or x = -10 

Since the side length of the cloth cannot be negative, we take x = 14 feet. 

Therefore, the original square piece of cloth had a perimeter of 4x = 56 feet. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x. 

When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x.

If we cut the rectangular piece diagonally in half, we get two right triangles. We know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. 

We can use the formula for the area of a right triangle, A = (1/2)bh, where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height. In this case, the base and height are the two sides of the rectangular piece of cloth. 

So, we have:

(1/2)(x-4)x = 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:

x = (4 ± sqrt(16 + 4*140))/2
x = (4 ± sqrt(596))/2
x = 2 ± sqrt(149)

Since x is a length, we know that it must be positive. Therefore, we can discard the negative solution and use:

x = 2 + sqrt(149)

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x, so we have:

4x = 4(2 + sqrt(149)) = 8 + 4sqrt(149)

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let's assume the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. After trimming 4 feet on one edge, the length of the rectangular piece becomes (x-4) feet, and the width remains x feet. Therefore, the area of the rectangular piece is x(x-4) = x^2 - 4x square feet. 

When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, two triangles are formed, each with an area of 70 square feet. Let's call the two sides of the triangle a and b. We know that the area of the triangle is (1/2)ab = 70. Therefore, ab = 140. 

We also know that a^2 + b^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2, since the diagonal of the rectangular piece is the hypotenuse of the two triangles. 

Solving for a and b, we get a = 2sqrt(35) and b = 2sqrt(10). 

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x. We know that x^2 - 4x = ab = 2sqrt(35) * 2sqrt(10) = 4sqrt(350). 

Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get x = 10 + 2sqrt(35). Therefore, the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x = 40 + 8sqrt(35).

Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:
  A: 46
  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
Let's call the width of the parking space "w". We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9, so the length of the parking space is 9 + w. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37, so:

2w + (9 + w) = 37

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3w + 9 = 37

3w = 28

w = 9.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

So the width of the parking space is approximately 9.33 feet, and the length is approximately 18.33 feet (9 + 9.33). Therefore, the area of the parking space is:

A = w x l
A = 9.33 x 18.33
A = 170.56

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the answer is 171.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let's denote the length of the painted sides as L and W (length and width), and the unpainted side as U. We know that:
2L + W = 37 (the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet)
W = 9 (the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet)

We can solve for L by substituting W = 9 into the first equation:
2L + 9 = 37
2L = 28
L = 14

Now that we know L and W, we can find the area of the parking space:
Area = L x W = 14 x 9 = 126

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let the length of the painted side be x and the width be y. We know that x + 2y = 37 (since three sides are painted and one unpainted) and y = 9. Solving for x, we get x = 19. Therefore, the area of the parking space is xy = 19*9 = 171 square feet.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let's assume the length of the painted sides to be L and W (length and width of the rectangular parking space). 

We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. So, the total perimeter of the rectangular parking space is:

2L + W = 37 (sum of the lengths of the painted sides)
L + W + 9 = 37 (adding the length of the unpainted side)
L + W = 28

We can now solve for L and W by using the above two equations. 

L = 28 - W

Substituting this value of L in the area formula:

Area = L x W
Area = (28 - W) x W
Area = 28W - W^2

To maximize the area, we need to find the maximum value of the above equation. We can do that by completing the square:

Area = -(W^2 - 28W)
Area = -(W^2 - 28W + 196 - 196)
Area = -(W - 14)^2 + 196

The maximum value of the above equation is 196, which occurs when W = 14. So, the length of the rectangular parking space is:

L = 28 - W = 28 - 14 = 14

Therefore, the area of the rectangular parking space is:

Area = L x W = 14 x 14 = 196 square feet

Answer: Answer("E") None of the Above. (The correct answer is 196, which is not one of the given choices).
Response 4:
Let's denote the length of the painted sides as l and w. Then we have:

2l + w = 37 (the sum of the lengths of the painted sides)
w = 9 (the length of the unpainted side)

Substituting w=9 into the first equation, we get:

2l + 9 = 37
2l = 28
l = 14

So the dimensions of the parking space are 14 feet by 9 feet, and its area is:

A = l * w = 14 * 9 = 126

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C").
Response 5:
We can start by using the information given to set up two equations. Let's call the length of the painted sides x and y. We know that x + y + 9 = 37 (sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37) and that the area of the rectangle is xy. We want to find the area, so we need to solve for x and y.

x + y = 28 (subtract 9 from both sides)
xy = A (let A represent the area)

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can use substitution to solve for one variable in terms of the other.

y = 28 - x (subtract x from both sides)

Now we can substitute this expression for y into the equation for area.

x(28 - x) = A

Simplifying this equation, we get:

28x - x^2 = A

To maximize the area, we want to find the value of x that makes this equation as large as possible. This is the vertex of the parabola, which occurs at x = 14. So:

A = 14(28 - 14) = 14(14) = 196

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 196 square feet.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Let's call the length of the painted side x and the width of the rectangle y. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9, so y = 9. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37, so 2x + y = 37. Substituting y = 9, we get 2x + 9 = 37, which gives us x = 14. 

Now we can find the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width: A = xy = 14(9) = 126. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's denote the length of the painted sides as x and y. We know that x + y + 9 = 37, which implies that x + y = 28. We also know that the area of the rectangle is given by A = xy. We can solve for y in terms of x using the equation x + y = 28, which gives y = 28 - x. Substituting this expression for y into the equation A = xy, we get A = x(28 - x) = 28x - x^2. To maximize the area, we need to find the value of x that maximizes this expression. The maximum value occurs at x = 14, which gives y = 28 - x = 14. Therefore, the area of the parking space is A = xy = 14 * 14 = 196 square feet.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let's denote the width of the parking space as w. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so the length of the parking space is 9 + w. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we can write an equation:

2w + (9 + w) = 37

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3w + 9 = 37

3w = 28

w = 9.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

So the width of the parking space is approximately 9.33 feet, and the length is approximately 18.33 feet. Therefore, the area of the parking space is:

A = length x width = 18.33 x 9.33 = 170.56 square feet

Therefore, the answer is approximately 170.56, which is closest to answer choice C: 126. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's call the length of the parking space "l" and the width "w". We know that one of the sides (width) is not painted, so its length is 9 feet. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, which means that the other two sides (lengths) add up to 37 - 2w. 

We can set up an equation based on the area of a rectangle: 

Area = length x width 

Substituting the values we know: 

Area = l x 9 

We can also use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet: 

37 - 2w = l 

Now we can substitute this into the equation for area: 

Area = (37 - 2w) x 9 

Expanding: 

Area = 333 - 18w 

To maximize the area, we want to minimize the value of w. The minimum value of w is 0 (a line), but that doesn't make sense for a parking space. The next smallest value is 4 (making the length 29), which gives an area of: 

Area = 333 - 18(4) = 261

We can solve this problem by using the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length x width. We know that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide, so let's call the length of the yard "L". We also know that the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. So we can set up the following equation:

L x 100 = 3000

To solve for L, we can divide both sides of the equation by 100:

L = 3000/100

L = 30

Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

Response 9:
Solution: 

Let's assume the length of the yard is L feet. 

We know that the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. 

We also know that the width of the yard is 100 feet. 

Therefore, the area of the yard can be expressed as: 

L x 100 = 3,000 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

L = 3,000 / 100 

L = 30 

So, the length of the yard is 30 feet.

Let the original numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9. We are given that (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. 

Cross-multiplying, we get:

23(3x-9) = 12(5x-9)
69x - 207 = 60x - 108
9x = 99
x = 11

So the original numbers are 33 and 55. The smaller number, after subtracting 9, is 24.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") - The smaller number is 24.

Topic: Math
Question: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 8
  C: 22
  D: 50
  E: 20
Response 0:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by 1. Therefore, Jack completes 2/3 of the work, which is 2/3 x 1 = 2/3. This means that the remaining work is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. 

Let's assume that Jill takes x hours to complete the remaining work. 

Since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the work per hour. 

Since Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, her rate of cleaning is 5/100 x 1/12 = 1/240 of the work per hour. 

Using the formula: rate x time = work, we can write two equations: 

Jack's work + Jill's work = 1
(1/12) * (2/3) + (1/240) * x = 1/3 

Simplifying the equation: 

(1/6) + (1/240) * x = 1/3
Multiplying both sides by 240: 
40 + x = 80
x = 40

Therefore, it takes Jill 40 hours to complete the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's denote the total time taken to clean the yacht by "t" hours. 
Since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, he can clean 1/12th of the yacht in 1 hour. 
Now, Jack finished two-thirds of the work, which means he cleaned (2/3) * (1 yacht) = 2/3 of the yacht. 
So, the remaining portion of the yacht that Jill has to clean is (1/3) of the yacht. 
Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means she can clean (1/20)th of the yacht in 1 hour. 
Let's denote the time taken by Jill to clean the remaining (1/3) of the yacht by "x" hours. 
So, we can set up the following equation: 
(1/20)*x = (1/3) - (2/3) 
Simplifying the right-hand side: 
(1/20)*x = (-1/3) 
Multiplying both sides by -60: 
-3x = 20 
Dividing both sides by -3: 
x = -20/3 
Since we are looking for a positive time, we can ignore the negative sign. 
Therefore, Jill takes 20/3 = 6.67 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the entire work is represented by 1. Then, Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, which means he can do 1/12 of the work in an hour. On a particular day, he finished two-thirds of the work, which means he completed 2/3 of the work. Therefore, the remaining portion of the work is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the work. 

Now, Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, Jill can do 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 of the work in an hour. Let's assume that Jill takes x hours to complete the remaining 1/3 of the work. 

Using the above information, we can create the following equation: 

1/3 = (1/12 * (24/3)) * (x) + (1/240 * (24/3)) * (x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

1/3 = (2/3) * x/12 + (1/40) * x/12

1/3 = (5/30) * x/12 + (3/120) * x/12

1/3 = (1/6) * x/12

Multiplying both sides by 12, we get:

4 = x

Therefore, Jill takes 4 hours to finish the remaining work.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's assume that the total time Jill takes to finish the remaining work is "t" hours. 

Since Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in 1 hour. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the remaining one-third of the work is done by Jill. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. So, Jill can clean 5/100 or 1/20 of what Jack can do in 1 hour. 

Now, we can set up an equation using the information given above: 

(1/3) = (1/12)*(2/3) + (1/20)*t 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

(1/3) = (1/18) + (1/20)*t 

Multiplying both sides by 180, we get: 

60 = 10 + 9t 

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 

50 = 9t 

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: 

t = 50/9 

So, Jill takes approximately 5.56 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Let's first calculate the fraction of work done by Jack: 2/3
This means that the remaining fraction of work is 1/3, which is done by Jill.

Let's now calculate Jack's rate of work:
If he can clean a yacht in 12 hours, then in 1 hour he can clean 1/12 of the yacht.
So, in x hours, he can clean x/12 of the yacht.

Since Jack completed 2/3 of the work, we can set up the following equation:
2/3 = x/12
Solving for x, we get x = 8

So, Jack took 8 hours to complete 2/3 of the work.
This means that Jill has to complete the remaining 1/3 of the work.

Let's now calculate Jill's rate of work:
Jill's rate of work is just 5% of what Jack can do.
If Jack can clean 1/12 of the yacht in 1 hour, then Jill can clean 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 of the yacht in 1 hour.

To find out how long it takes Jill to complete 1/3 of the work, we can use the following equation:
1/240 * x = 1/3
Solving for x, we get x = 72

Therefore, it takes Jill 72 hours to complete the remaining work.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by 1. Therefore, Jack cleans 2/3 of the work, which is (2/3) * 1 = 2/3. The remaining work is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. 

Let's assume that Jill takes t hours to clean the remaining 1/3 of the work. 

Jack can clean the entire work in 12 hours, which means that his rate of cleaning is 1/12. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate, which is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240. 

Using the formula: rate = work / time, we can set up the equation: 

Jack's rate * (2/3) + Jill's rate * t = 1/3

Substituting the values of Jack's and Jill's rate, we get: 

(1/12) * (2/3) + (1/240) * t = 1/3

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

t = 20

Therefore, it takes Jill 20 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let's first find out how long it takes Jack to finish the work. If he can clean a yacht in 12 hours, then in one hour he can clean 1/12th of the yacht. 

If Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, then the remaining one-third of the work is left for Jill. So, the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work is what we need to find. 

Let's assume that it takes Jill "x" hours to finish the remaining work. 

Now, we know that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. So, in one hour, Jill can clean 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240th of the yacht. 

Since Jill and Jack together finish the work, we can set up the equation: 

  Two-thirds of the work = Jack's rate * Jill's time + Jill's rate * Jill's time
  
  2/3 = 1/12 * (total time - Jill's time) + 1/240 * Jill's time
  
  Solving for Jill's time, we get:
  
  Jill's time = 8 hours
  
  Therefore, the answer is (B) 8. 
  
  Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Let's first calculate the fraction of work Jack does on the particular day. If he can clean the yacht in 12 hours, then in 1 hour he can clean 1/12 of the yacht. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, then he does (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 of the work in 1 hour. So, the remaining 1/3 of the work must be done by Jill.

Let's now find out how long it takes Jill to do 1/3 of the work. We know that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. So, in 1 hour, Jill can clean 5/100 * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht. Let's say it takes her x hours to clean 1/3 of the yacht. Then, we can set up the following equation:

(1/240) * x * (1/3) = 1

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 240 * 3 = 720

Therefore, it takes Jill 720 hours to finish the remaining work.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's first find out how long Jack would take to clean the yacht by himself. If he takes 12 hours to do the whole job, then in 1 hour he can do 1/12 of the job. 

Since Jack completed two-thirds of the work, only one-third of the work is left for Jill. Therefore, Jill has to do 1/3 of the job. 

We know that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. So, in 1 hour, Jill can do 5% of what Jack can do. 

Thus, in 1 hour, Jill can do (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the job. 

To find out how long Jill would take to do 1/3 of the job, we can set up the equation: 

(1/240) * t = 1/3

where t is the time it takes Jill to do the remaining work. 

Solving for t, we get: 

t = (1/3) * 240 = 80

Therefore, it would take Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let's calculate the amount of work Jack can do in 1 hour, which is 1/12 of the yacht. If he finishes two-thirds of the work, then the remaining one-third is left for Jill to do. Since Jill's rate is just 5% of Jack's rate, she can do 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 of the yacht in 1 hour. 

To find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we can use the formula: 

time = amount of work ÷ rate

The amount of work left for Jill to do is 1/3 of the yacht, and her rate is 1/240 of the yacht per hour. 

time = (1/3) ÷ (1/240) = 80

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's call the hundreds digit of the number "a", the tens digit "b", and the ones digit "c". 

From the first piece of information, we know that:

a + b + c = 17

From the second piece of information, we know that:

a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109

We can use the first equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other two. For example, we can solve for "a" as:

a = 17 - b - c

Now we can substitute this expression for "a" into the second equation:

(17 - b - c)^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109

Expanding the squared term and simplifying, we get:

2b^2 + 2c^2 - 34b - 34c + 120 = 0

Dividing both sides by 2 and rearranging, we get:

b^2 - 17b + c^2 - 17c + 60 = 0

We can factor this equation as:

(b - 5)(b - 12) + (c - 5)(c - 12) = 0

This means that either (b - 5)(b - 12) = 0 or (c - 5)(c - 12) = 0. 

If (b - 5)(b - 12) = 0, then b must be either 5 or 12. Similarly, if (c - 5)(c - 12) = 0, then c must be either 5 or 12. 

Now we can use the third piece of information to narrow down the possibilities. We know that if we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number with the same digits in reverse order. This means that the hundreds digit and the ones digit must be the same, and the tens digit must be one less than or one more than the other two digits. 

If b = 5 and c = 5, then a = 7. The original number is 755, and 755 - 495 = 260, which does not have the same digits in reverse order. 

If b = 12 and c = 5, then a = 0, which is not possible for a three-digit number. 

If b = 5 and c = 12, then a = 0, which is not possible for a three-digit number. 

If b = 12 and c = 12, then a = 5. The original number is 512, and 512 - 495 = 17, which does have the same digits in reverse order. 

Therefore, the answer is 512. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let's assume the three-digit number is represented as $abc$. Then, we can write the given information as:

$a+b+c = 17$  ...(1)

$a^2+b^2+c^2 = 109$  ...(2)

$100a+10b+c - 495 = 100c+10b+a$  ...(3)

Simplifying equation (3), we get:

$99a - 99c = 495$

$a - c = 5$  ...(4)

Now, we can substitute $a = 5+c$ from equation (4) into equation (1) to get:

$5 + 2c + b = 17$

$2c + b = 12$  ...(5)

Also, we can substitute $a = 5+c$ from equation (4) into equation (2) to get:

$(5+c)^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109$

$c^2 + b^2 + 10c + 25 = 109$

$b^2 + c^2 + 10c - 84 = 0$  ...(6)

Now, we can use equation (5) to substitute $b = 12 - 2c$ into equation (6) to get:

$(12-2c)^2 + c^2 + 10c - 84 = 0$

$5c^2 - 52c + 120 = 0$

$(5c-12)(c-10) = 0$

$c = 2.4$ or $c = 10$

Since $c$ is a digit, we can only take $c = 10$ and $b = 12 - 2c = -8$. But, $b$ is also a digit, so we cannot take $b = -8$. Hence, $c$ cannot be equal to $10$.

Therefore, we must take $c = 2$ and $b = 12 - 2c = 8$. Now, we can substitute $a = 5+c = 7$ into equation (3) to get:

$702 - 495 = 207$

Hence, the three-digit number is $abc = 728$.

Answer: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's assume the three-digit number is represented by $abc$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the digits. We know that $a+b+c=17$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. We also know that $100a+10b+c-495=100c+10b+a$. Simplifying this equation gives us $99a-99c=495$ or $a-c=5$. Now we can solve for $a$ and $c$ in terms of $b$. We have $a+b+c=17$ which becomes $2b+a+c=17$. We also have $a-c=5$ which becomes $a=c+5$. Substituting this into the first equation gives us $2b+2c+5=17$ or $b+c=6$. Now we can try out different values of $b$ and $c$ that add up to 6 and see if they satisfy the equation $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. We find that $b=1$ and $c=5$ work, which means $a=11-1-5=5$. Therefore, the number is $abc=515$. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Let's call the hundreds digit x, the tens digit y, and the ones digit z. Then the number can be written as 100x + 10y + z. 

From the first piece of information, we know that x + y + z = 17. 

From the second piece of information, we know that x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109. 

From the third piece of information, we know that 100x + 10y + z - 495 = 100z + 10y + x. Simplifying this equation, we get 99x - 99z = 495, or x - z = 5. 

We can use the first and third equations to eliminate y: y = 17 - x - z. 

Substituting these expressions for y and z into the equation for the sum of squares, we get:

x^2 + (17 - x - z)^2 + z^2 = 109

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

2x^2 + 2z^2 - 34x - 34z + 170 = 0

Dividing by 2, we get:

x^2 + z^2 - 17x - 17z + 85 = 0

We can use the equation x - z = 5 to substitute for z in terms of x:

z = x - 5

Substituting into the equation above, we get:

x^2 + (x - 5)^2 - 17x - 17(x - 5) + 85 = 0

Simplifying, we get:

2x^2 - 52x + 160 = 0

Dividing by 2, we get:

x^2 - 26x + 80 = 0

Factoring, we get:

(x - 10)(x - 16) = 0

So x = 10 or x = 16. 

If x = 10, then z = 5 and y = 2. This gives us the number 215. But if we subtract 495 from this, we get 215 - 495 = -280, which doesn't have the same digits written in reverse order. 

If x = 16, then z = 11 and y = -10, which doesn't work. 

Therefore, there is no solution that satisfies all the conditions.

Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let the hundreds, tens, and units digits be a, b, and c respectively. Then, we have:
a + b + c = 17   ...(1)
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109   ...(2)
100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a   ...(3)
Simplifying equation (3), we get:
99a - 99c = 495
a - c = 5   ...(4)
Adding equations (1) and (4), we get:
2a + b = 22   ...(5)
Subtracting equation (4) from (1), we get:
2b + 2c = 12
b + c = 6   ...(6)
Solving equations (5) and (6), we get:
a = 9, b = 4, c = 3
Therefore, the number is 943, and checking, we see that 943 - 495 = 348, which is the number with the digits in reverse order.

Choices:
  A: 270
  B: 300
  C: 280
  D: 320
  E: 315
Response 0:
Solution:
Let the cost price of the article be x.
Selling price = Cost price + Profit
Selling price = x + 20% of x = 1.2x
Given, Selling price = Rs.360
1.2x = 360
x = 300
Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's assume the cost price of the article be x.
As per the question, the trader sold the article at a profit of 20%.
So, the selling price of the article would be (100% + 20%) = 120% of the cost price.
Selling price = 120% of x = 1.2x
Given, Selling price = Rs.360
Therefore, 1.2x = 360
x = 360/1.2
x = 300

Hence, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let the cost price of the article be x.
The selling price of the article = x + 20% of x = 1.2x

x = 360/1.2
x = 300

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Solution: 

Let's assume the cost price of the article be x.

The selling price of the article is Rs.360, and the profit is 20%.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price

20% of Cost price = 360 - Cost price

20/100 * x = 360 - x

Multiplying both sides by 100, we get:

20x = 36000 - 100x

120x = 36000

x = 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

Question: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 30
  C: 45
  D: 60
  E: 75
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. 

On Sunday, it buys twice as many, which is 2x newspapers. 

On the remaining days of the week, it buys (7-2) = 5 newspapers per day, which is a total of 5*5 = 25 newspapers. 

Therefore, the total number of newspapers bought in a week is 2x + x + 25 = 3x + 25. 

The hotel pays $4 per Sunday newspaper and $1 per newspaper on the remaining days of the week. 

Therefore, the total cost of newspapers per week is 4(2x) + x(5) + 25(1) = 8x + 5. 

We know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. 

So, we can set up the following equation: 

8x + 5 = 210 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 25 

Therefore, the hotel buys 25 newspapers on Monday. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Then, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. The total cost of buying these newspapers for a week is $210. 

So, the equation can be written as follows: 

2x($4) + 5x($1) = $210 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

8x + 5x = $210 

13x = $210 

x = $210/13 

x ≈ 16.15 

Since the hotel can't buy a fraction of a newspaper, it must buy 16 newspapers on Monday. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let's start by using variables to represent the number of newspapers bought on each day. Let x be the number of newspapers bought on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and let y be the number of newspapers bought on Sunday. 

From the problem, we know that:
- y = 2x (the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week)
- 4y + 1(5x) = 210 (the hotel pays $4 per Sunday newspaper and $1 per newspaper on the other days, and the total cost per week is $210)

Substituting y = 2x into the second equation, we get:
4(2x) + 5x = 210
8x + 5x = 210
13x = 210
x = 16.15 (rounded to two decimal places)

Since the number of newspapers bought must be a whole number, the hotel must buy 16 newspapers on Monday. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. 

On Sunday, it buys twice as many as it does on Monday, which is 2x. 

For the remaining days of the week (Tuesday to Saturday), it buys x newspapers each day. 

So the total number of newspapers bought in a week is: 

2x (Sunday) + 5x (Monday to Friday) = 7x 

The cost of buying these newspapers is $4 for Sunday and $1 for the rest of the days, so: 

4(2x) + 1(5x) = 8x + 5x = 13x 

We know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, so: 

13x = 210 

x = 16.15 (rounded to two decimal places) 

Since the hotel can only buy whole newspapers, it buys 16 newspapers on Monday. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let's start by using variables to represent the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday. Let's call this variable "m". 

We know that the hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on the other days of the week. If we call the number of newspapers bought on Sunday "s", then we can write:

s = 2m 

We also know that the hotel pays $4 for each Sunday newspaper and $1 for each newspaper bought on the other days of the week. If we add up the total cost for the week, we get:

4s + 1(7m) = 210 

Simplifying this equation, we get:

4(2m) + 7m = 210 

8m + 7m = 210 

15m = 210 

m = 14 

So the hotel buys 14 newspapers on Monday. 

Answer: Answer("A") 15
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on each day of the week except Sunday. On Sunday, it buys 2x newspapers. 

The total cost of the newspapers per week is $210. So, we can set up an equation:
2x($4) + 5x($1) = $210
Simplifying the equation:
8x + 5x = $210
13x = $210
x = $210/13

Therefore, the hotel buys approximately 16 newspapers on Monday (since it buys x newspapers on each day of the week except Sunday and x is approximately $210/13, which is slightly more than 16). 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Then, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. The total cost of newspapers per week is $210. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

Simplifying the equation, we get:

16x + 5x = 210/2

21x = 105

Question: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
Choices:
  A: 144km
  B: 72 km
  C: 126km
  D: 84 km
  E: 48km
Response 0:
Let us assume that the distance between X and Y is d. 

When Allen and Bob meet for the first time, they have covered a total distance of d. 

Let t be the time taken for them to meet for the first time. 

Therefore, Allen has covered a distance of 54t and Bob has covered a distance of 78t. 

When they meet for the second time, Allen has covered a distance of 2d and Bob has covered a distance of 2d + 48km. 

Let t' be the time taken for them to meet for the second time. 

Therefore, we can write the following equation: 

2d = 54t' + 78t' - 48 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

2d = 132t' - 48 

d = 66t' - 24 

We know that Allen's speed is 54 kmph and Bob's speed is 78 kmph. 

Let us assume that Allen and Bob meet at a distance of x from X. 

Therefore, the distance between Y and the point of meeting is d - x. 

We can write the following equation based on the time taken for them to meet for the first time: 

54t = x 

78t = d - x 

Solving the equations, we get: 

t = x/54 

t = (d - x)/78 

Equating the two equations, we get: 

x/54 = (d - x)/78 

Solving for d, we get: 

d = 126 km 

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 126 km. 

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the distance between X and Y is d km. 

When Allen and Bob meet for the first time, let's say they have both traveled x km. At this point, Allen has covered half the distance and Bob has covered the other half. 

Then, time taken by Allen to travel x km = x/54 hours
Time taken by Bob to travel (d - x) km = (d - x)/78 hours

Since they both started at the same time, we can equate their time taken: x/54 = (d - x)/78

Solving for x, we get x = 18d/31

When they meet for the second time, let's say Allen has traveled y km from Y towards X. At this point, Bob has traveled (d + y) km from X towards Y. 

Time taken by Allen to travel y km = y/54 hours
Time taken by Bob to travel (d + y - x) km = (d + y - x)/78 hours

Since they both started at the same time, we can equate their time taken: y/54 = (d + y - x)/78

Solving for y, we get y = 9d/31

We know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen when they meet for the second time. So, (d + y - x) - (y) = 48

Simplifying, we get d - x = 16

Substituting the value of x in terms of d, we get d - 18d/31 = 16

Solving for d, we get d = 144 km

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 144 km.

Answer: Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's call the distance between X and Y "d". 
When they first meet, they have both covered a total distance of "d". 
Let's call the time it takes for them to meet for the first time "t". 
Since Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78 kmph, we can set up the following equation: 

54t + 78t = d 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

132t = d 

Now let's consider the second time they meet. At this point, Allen has traveled a total distance of 2d, and Bob has traveled a total distance of 2d + 48 km (since he has covered 48 km more than Allen). 

We can set up the following equation to represent the second meeting: 

54t + (2d + 48) = 78t + 2d 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

24t = 48 

t = 2 

Now we can substitute this value of "t" back into our first equation to solve for "d": 

132t = d 
132(2) = d 
d = 264 

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 264 km. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let the distance between X and Y be d.
Let t be the time taken for Allen and Bob to meet for the first time.
In t hours, Allen covers a distance of 54t and Bob covers a distance of 78t.
When they meet for the first time, the sum of the distances covered by Allen and Bob is equal to d.
Therefore, 54t + 78t = d. This gives us the value of t in terms of d: t = d/132.
When they meet for the second time, Allen has covered a distance of 2(54t) = 108t and Bob has covered a distance of 2(78t + 48) = 156t + 96.
Since they meet at the same time, the sum of the distances covered by Allen and Bob is equal to d.
Therefore, 108t + 156t + 96 = d.
Substituting the value of t in terms of d, we get:
108(d/132) + 156(d/132) + 96 = d
Simplifying and solving for d, we get:
d = 126 km
Therefore, the answer is (C) 126km.
Response 4:
Let's assume the distance between X and Y is D km. 

When they meet for the first time, let's say they have both traveled a distance of x km from their starting points. 

At this point, Allen has traveled from X to Y and then back to (Y-x) km. 
Bob has traveled from Y to X and then back to (X+x) km. 

The time taken by both of them to meet for the first time is the same. 

Therefore, (Y-x)/54 = (X+x)/78 

Solving this equation, we get X = 2Y/5 

Now, let's consider the second meeting point. 

At this point, let's say they have both traveled a distance of y km from their starting points. 

At this point, Allen has traveled from X to Y and then back to (Y-y) km. 
Bob has traveled from Y to X and then back to (X+y) km. 

We are given that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. 

Therefore, (X+y) - (Y-y) = 48 

Substituting X = 2Y/5, we get Y = 180 km 

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 2Y = 360 km 

Answer: Action: Answer("A") 
Response 5:
Let's call the distance between X and Y as 'd'. Let's also assume that the time taken by both Allen and Bob to meet for the second time is 't'. 

When they meet for the first time, let's say they have each traveled a distance of 'x' km from their starting points. At this point, Allen has covered x km and Bob has covered (d - x) km. 

Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can write two equations:
1. x = 54t  (since Allen is traveling at 54 kmph)
2. d - x = 78t  (since Bob is traveling at 78 kmph)

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:
t = d/132

Now, let's consider the second meeting point. At this point, Allen has traveled a total distance of (d + x) km and Bob has traveled a total distance of (d + (d - x + 48)) km. 

Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can write two more equations:
1. d + x = 54t  (since Allen is traveling at 54 kmph)
2. d + (d - x + 48) = 78t  (since Bob is traveling at 78 kmph)

Substituting the value of 't' from the first set of equations, we get:
d + x = 54(d/132)
d + (d - x + 48) = 78(d/132)

Simplifying these equations, we get:
x = d/3 - 16
d = 264

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 264 km. 

Answer: Option (None of the above) - The correct answer is not listed in the choices.
Response 6:
Let the distance between X and Y be d. Let t be the time taken for them to meet for the first time. Since they are moving towards each other, the total distance they cover is d and the relative speed is 54+78 = 132 kmph. Therefore, t = d/132.

When they meet for the first time, Allen would have covered a distance of 54t and Bob would have covered a distance of 78t. At this point, Bob is 48 km ahead of Allen. Therefore, 78t - 54t = 48, which gives t = 4 hours.

In 4 hours, Allen covers a distance of 54t = 54 x 4 = 216 km. At this point, Bob has covered a distance of d - 48 km. When they meet for the second time, they would have covered a total distance of d + (d - 48) = 2d - 48. The time taken to cover this distance is (2d - 48)/132.

At the second meeting point, Allen would have covered a distance of 54 x (2d - 48)/132 = 3/11 (2d - 48) km. Bob would have covered a distance of (d - 48) - 78 x (2d - 48)/132 = (5d - 336)/11 km.

Since they cover the same distance, we have:

3/11 (2d - 48) = (5d - 336)/11 + 48

Solving for d, we get d = 126 km.

Answer: Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's assume the distance between X and Y is d km.
Let's also assume that they meet for the second time after t hours.
When they meet for the first time, let's say Allen has traveled a distance of x km from X towards Y. Therefore, Bob has traveled (d-x) km from Y towards X. The time taken for both of them to meet for the first time is the same, so we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
Therefore, (x / 54) = ((d-x) / 78)
Simplifying this equation, we get: 78x = 54(d-x)
Solving for x, we get: x = 18d/31
When they meet for the second time, Allen would have traveled a distance of (2x) km and Bob would have traveled a distance of (d + 48) km.
Using the formula: time = distance / speed, we can write two equations:
(2x / 54) = t  and  ((d+48) / 78) = t
Equating both these equations, we get: (2x / 54) = ((d+48) / 78)
Substituting the value of x from the first equation we derived, we get: d = 144 km
Therefore, the answer is A: 144 km.
Response 8:
Let the distance between X and Y be d. Let the time taken by both Allen and Bob to meet for the second time be t.
When they meet for the first time, let the distance covered by Allen be x. Therefore, the distance covered by Bob will be d - x.
Time taken by Allen to cover x distance = x/54
Time taken by Bob to cover d - x distance = (d - x)/78
Therefore, t = x/54 + (d - x)/78
When they meet for the second time, Allen would have covered a distance of 2x and Bob would have covered a distance of d + 2(d - x) = 3d - 2x.
Given that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, we can write the following equation:
3d - 2x - 2x = 48 + 2x
3d - 4x = 48
4x - 3d = -48
We need to solve for d.
Multiplying the equation by 2, we get:
8x - 6d = -96
Substituting the value of t from above, we get:
t = x/54 + (d - x)/78 = (2d)/t
Multiplying the equation by 54*78*t, we get:
78t*x + 54t(d - x) = 2*54*78*d
Simplifying the equation, we get:
39x + 27(d - x) = 702
12x + 27d = 702
4x + 9d = 234
Multiplying the equation by 4 and subtracting it from the earlier equation, we get:
12d = 312
d = 26 km
Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 2d = 52 km.
Answer: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken by Allen to reach Y be t hours. At that time, Bob has already covered d km and is t hours away from X. So, the time taken by Bob to reach X is also t hours. Once Allen changes his direction at Y, he takes another t hours to reach X. Similarly, once Bob changes his direction at X, he takes another t hours to reach Y. Therefore, the total time taken by Bob to cover the distance between X and Y is 3t hours, and the total time taken by Allen is 2t hours.

Now, we can use the formula distance = speed x time to get two equations in two variables. Let's use A and B to denote the distances covered by Allen and Bob respectively in the first t hours. Then we have:

A = 54t
B = d + 78t

In the next t hours, Allen covers a distance of 54t in the opposite direction, so his net distance covered is A - 54t = 0. Bob covers a distance of 78t in the same direction, so his net distance covered is B + 78t. We know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time, so we can set up another equation:

B + 78t = A - 54t + 48

Substituting the expressions for A and B, we get:

d + 78t + 78t = 54t + 48 + 54t

Simplifying, we get:

d = 126t - 48

Now we need to find t in terms of d. We know that in the first t hours, Allen covers a distance of 54t, which is half the distance between X and Y. So we have:

54t = d/2

Solving for t, we get:

t = d/108

Substituting this into the expression for d in terms of t, we get:

d = 126t - 48 = 126(d/108) - 48 = (7/6)d - 48

Solving for d, we get:

d = 144 km

Therefore, the answer is A: 144 km.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
Response 0:
Solution:
Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.
Let's also assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is "s" km/hr.
Given, the time taken for the forward journey is 6 hours.
Therefore, using the formula distance = speed × time, we have d = s × 6.
During the return journey, the speed of the jeep is increased by 12km/hr. Therefore, the speed of the jeep in the return journey is (s+12) km/hr.
Given, the time taken for the return journey is 4 hours.
Therefore, using the formula distance = speed × time, we have d = (s+12) × 4.
Equating the two equations, we get s = 24 km/hr.
Substituting the value of s in the equation d = s × 6, we get d = 144 km.

Answer: Answer("B")  (144km)
Response 1:
Solution: Let the distance travelled by the jeep be "d" km.
Let the speed during the forward journey be "s" km/hr.
According to the problem, 
d = s x 6  ...(1)
On the return journey, the speed increased by 12 km/hr. So the speed during the return journey is (s+12) km/hr.
Again, according to the problem,
d = (s+12) x 4  ...(2)
From equations (1) and (2), we get
6s = 4(s+12)
Solving the above equation, we get s = 18 km/hr
Substituting s = 18 in equation (1), we get
d = 18 x 6 = 108 km
Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 108 km.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Solution:
Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.
Let's also assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is "s" km/hr.
According to the problem, during the forward journey:
time taken, t1 = 6 hours
speed, s = d/6 km/hr
During the return journey:
time taken, t2 = 4 hours
speed, s+12 = d/4 km/hr
We know that speed = distance/time
Therefore, d/6 = s and d/4 = s+12
Solving these equations, we get d = 144 km.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Solution: 

Let the distance travelled by the jeep be "d" km.

Let the speed of the jeep during the forward journey be "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

d = s x 6   ------(1)   (time = distance / speed)

d = (s + 12) x 4   ------(2)

From (1), we have s = d/6

Substituting s = d/6 in (2), we get

d = (d/6 + 12) x 4

d = d/3 + 48

d/3 = 48

d = 144 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144km.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Solution: 

Let the distance traveled be 'd' km. 

Let the speed during the forward journey be 's' km/hr. 

According to the problem, 

d = s * 6  (since time = distance/speed) 

d = (s+12) * 4 

Equating the above two equations, we get 

6s = 4(s+12) 

Solving the above equation, we get 

s = 18 km/hr 

Substituting the value of 's' in any of the above two equations, we get 

d = 108 km 

Therefore, the jeep traveled a distance of 108 km. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Solution:
Let's assume that the jeep's speed for the forward journey is "x" km/hr.
Therefore, the speed for the return journey would be "x + 12" km/hr.
Let's also assume that the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.

Using the formula, Speed = Distance / Time
We can write the following equations:
x = d / 6   (since it took 6 hours for the forward journey)
x + 12 = d / 4   (since it took 4 hours for the return journey)

Solving for "d" in both equations, we get:
d = 6x
d = 4(x + 12)

Equating both equations, we get:
6x = 4(x + 12)
Solving for "x", we get:
x = 12

Substituting the value of "x" in any of the above equations, we get:
d = 6x
d = 6(12)
d = 72

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 72 km.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") [The answer should be 72km, but it is not one of the available choices.]
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let's use the formula Distance = Speed x Time. 

Let's assume that the jeep's speed during the forward journey is S km/hr. Then, the speed during the return journey is (S + 12) km/hr. 

Let's also assume that the distance travelled by the jeep is D km.

Using the formula Distance = Speed x Time, we can create two equations:

Forward journey: D = S x 6
Return journey: D = (S + 12) x 4

We can solve for D by equating the two equations:

S x 6 = (S + 12) x 4
6S = 4S + 48
2S = 48
S = 24

Substituting S = 24 into one of the equations, we get:

D = S x 6
D = 24 x 6
D = 144

Therefore, the jeep travelled a distance of 144 km.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Solution: 

Let the distance be x km and the speed be y km/hr.

According to the problem, 

x = 6y  (since time taken during forward journey = 6 hours)

x = 4(y+12)  (since time taken during return journey = 4 hours and speed increased by 12km/hr)

Solving these equations, we get:

6y = 4(y+12)

2y = 24

y = 12km/hr

Substituting this value of y in any of the above equations, we get:

x = 6y = 6*12 = 72km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 72km.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 28
  C: 30
  D: 53
  E: 59
Response 0:
Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies will double to reach the fully covered state. If there is only one water lily initially, then it will take 6 doublings to reach 64 (2^6 = 64). Since it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered, and the number of lilies doubles every two days, it will take 6 * 2 = 12 days for the number of lilies to double 6 times. 

Now, we need to find out how many more days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, starting from 64. Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, it will take one more doubling to reach 128 (which is more than enough to fully cover the lake). This doubling will take 2 more days. Therefore, the total number of days it will take to fully cover the lake starting from 64 is 12 + 2 = 14.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula which is P(t) = P0 * 2^(t/k) where P0 is the initial population, t is the time, k is the doubling time and P(t) is the population after time t.

We know that P0 = 64, k = 2 and P(60) = 2^30.

We need to find t such that P(t) = 2^6 * P0 = 2^6 * 64 = 4096.

Substituting the values in the exponential growth formula, we get:

4096 = 64 * 2^(t/2)

64 = 2^(t/2)

2^6 = 2^(t/2)

6 = t/2

t = 12

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 12 days.

Answer: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
We can start by using the formula for exponential growth/decay: 

N = N0 * 2^(t/k)

where:
N0 = initial quantity
N = final quantity
t = time elapsed
k = time constant

Let's first find the time constant, k. We know that the number of water lilies doubles every two days, so k = 2. 

For the first scenario (one water lily initially), we have:

60 = 1 * 2^(60/2k)
2^(30/k) = 60

For the second scenario (64 water lilies initially), we have:

N = 64 * 2^(t/2)

We want to find t when N = the maximum number of lilies that can cover the lake. Let's call that number M. We can find M by using the same formula as before, but with N0 = 1:

M = 1 * 2^(60/2k) = 2^30

Now we can solve for t:

M = 64 * 2^(t/2)
2^30 = 2^6 * 2^(t/2)
2^24 = 2^(t/2)
t/2 = 24
t = 48

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula: N = N0 * 2^(t/k), where N is the final number of water lilies, N0 is the initial number of water lilies, t is the time it takes for the population to grow, k is the doubling time of the population.

We know that N0 = 64, k = 2, and t = ?.
Using the information given in the problem, we can set up the following equation:

60 = t/2 * log2(2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

60 = t

Therefore, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, if initially there were only one water lily on it. 

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it. Using the same formula, we get:

N = 64 * 2^(t/2)

When N = 2^6 * 2^(t/2)

When N = 2^(6 + t/2)

When 2^(6 + t/2) = 2^(log2(2^60))

When 6 + t/2 = 60

When t = 108

Therefore, it takes 108 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula. If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the growth factor is 2^(1/2) per day. If there was one water lily initially, then after 60 days there will be 2^(60/2) = 2^30 water lilies on the lake. 

If initially there were 64 water lilies, then after x days there will be 64 * 2^(x/2) water lilies on the lake. We want to find x such that 64 * 2^(x/2) = 2^30. Dividing both sides by 64, we get 2^(x/2) = 2^25, which implies x/2 = 25. Therefore, x = 50.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies will double to get to the final number. If there is one water lily initially and it doubles every two days, then after 60 days it will have doubled 30 times (since 60/2 = 30). 

Now, if there are 64 water lilies initially, we need to find out how many times we need to double this number to get to the final number. 

64 * 2^x = final number of water lilies

where x is the number of times we need to double 64 to get to the final number. 

If we divide both sides by 64, we get:

2^x = final number of water lilies / 64

Since the final number of water lilies is double the previous number every two days, we know that:

final number of water lilies = 64 * 2^(number of doubles)

So we can substitute this into the equation:

2^x = (64 * 2^(number of doubles)) / 64

Simplifying:

2^x = 2^(number of doubles)

We can solve for x by setting the exponents equal to each other:

x = number of doubles

We know that the number of doubles is 30 (from the first part of the problem), so x = 30. 

Therefore, the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies is:

initial number of days + number of days to double 64 30 times
= 0 + 2*30
= 60

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula. If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of lilies after "t" days can be represented by the formula: N = N0 * 2^(t/2), where N0 is the initial number of lilies. We know that N0 = 64 and N = the maximum number of lilies that the lake can have. We also know that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies. So, we can set up the following equation:

N = N0 * 2^(t/2)
2^6 = 64 * 2^(t/2)
2^(t/2) = 2^6
t/2 = 6
t = 12

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 12 + 2 = 14 days.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies doubles from 1 to 2^6 (64). It doubles 6 times because 2^6 = 64. Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, it will double 6 times 2 = 12 days. Therefore, it will take 60 - 12 = 48 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies doubles until the lake is fully covered. If there is one lily initially, and it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered, then the number of times the lilies double is 60/2 = 30 times. 

Now, let's find out how many water lilies there will be after 30 doublings, if there are initially 64 lilies. 

64 * 2^30 = 68,719,476,736

Therefore, there will be 68,719,476,736 water lilies on the 30th day. 

Answer: Choice C: 30
Response 9:
Let's solve this problem step-by-step:
- We know that the number of water lilies doubles every two days.
- We also know that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, if initially there was only one water lily on it.
- Therefore, we can write an equation to represent the situation: 2^(t/2) = N, where t is the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, and N is the number of water lilies initially on the lake.
- Substituting t = 60 and N = 1, we get: 2^(60/2) = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824.
- This means that there will be over a billion water lilies on the lake after 60 days, if initially there was only one water lily on it.
- Now, let's solve for t when N = 64: 2^(t/2) = 64 => 2^(t/2) = 2^6 => t/2 = 6 => t = 12.
- Therefore, it will take 12 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Response 4:
Let the weight of the new heavy duty truck be x tons. 

The total weight of the 10 vehicles before the new truck was added is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons. 

After the new truck was added, the total weight became (10 * 12.2) + x. 

The new average weight is given as 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons. 

So, we can set up the equation:

(122 + x) / 11 = 14.8

Solving for x, we get:

x = 44.8

Therefore, the weight of the new heavy duty truck is 44.8 tons.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let the weight of the new truck be x. 

The sum of the weights of the 10 vehicles before the new truck was added is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons. 

After the new truck was added, the sum of the weights of the 11 vehicles became 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons. 

Therefore, the weight of the new truck is x = 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let's solve the problem by using the formula for the arithmetic mean: 

average = (sum of all weights) / (number of weights)

Let x be the weight of the heavy duty truck in tons. 

Before the new truck was added, the sum of the weights of the 10 vehicles was:

10 * 12.2 = 122

After the new truck was added, the sum of the weights of the 11 vehicles became:

11 * (12.2 + 2.6) = 157.2

So, we can write the equation:

(122 + x) / 11 = 14.2

Solving for x:

122 + x = 11 * 14.2

122 + x = 156.2

x = 34.2

Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 34.2 tons.

Question: Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Choices:
  A: 50 %
  B: 60 %
  C: 55 %
  D: 70 %
  E: 58%
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A") 

The cost price of 1 kg of oranges = 450/90 = Rs. 5
The selling price of 1 kg of oranges = Rs. 7.50
Profit per kg of oranges = Selling price - Cost price = Rs. 7.50 - Rs. 5 = Rs. 2.50
Profit percentage = (Profit/Cost price) x 100
Profit percentage = (2.5/5) x 100 = 50%
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")  

Explanation: 
The cost price of 1 kg of oranges = 450/90 = Rs. 5
The selling price of 1 kg of oranges = Rs. 7.50
Profit per kg of oranges = Selling price - Cost price = 7.50 - 5 = Rs. 2.50
Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100
Profit percentage = (2.50 / 5) x 100 = 50%
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A") 

The cost price of 1 kg of orange = 450/90 = Rs. 5

The selling price of 1 kg of orange = Rs. 7.50

Profit per kg of orange = Selling price - Cost price = Rs. 7.50 - Rs. 5 = Rs. 2.50

Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100

Profit percentage = (2.5 / 5) x 100 = 50%
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C") 

The selling price of 90 kg of oranges at Rs. 7.50 per kg is Rs. (90 x 7.50) = Rs. 675.
The cost price of 90 kg of oranges is Rs. 450.
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = Rs. (675 - 450) = Rs. 225.
Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) x 100 = (225 / 450) x 100 = 50%.
Therefore, the merchant's percentage gain is 55%.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A") 

The cost price of 1 kg of orange = 450/90 = Rs. 5

The selling price of 1 kg of orange = Rs. 7.50

Profit per kg of orange = Selling price per kg of orange - Cost price per kg of orange
= Rs. 7.50 - Rs. 5 = Rs. 2.50

Profit percentage = (Profit/Cost price) x 100
= (2.5/5) x 100
= 50%

Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is 50%.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A") 

The cost price of 1 kg of oranges = 450/90 = Rs. 5

The selling price of 1 kg of oranges = Rs. 7.50

Profit on 1 kg of oranges = Selling price - Cost price = 7.50 - 5 = Rs. 2.50

Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 = (2.5/5) x 100 = 50% 

Therefore, the merchant gained 50% on the purchase of oranges.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A") 

The total selling price of 90 kg of oranges at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg = 90 x 7.50 = Rs. 675
The profit made by the merchant = Selling price - Cost price = 675 - 450 = Rs. 225
Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 = (225 / 450) x 100 = 50%

Topic: Math
Question: Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 23
  C: 16
  D: 18
  E: 12
Response 0:
Action: Answer("15")

Explanation: 

Let's assume that the coin landed on Heads x times and Tails y times. 

According to the problem statement, Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan x times and Jonathan gave $3 to Christopher y times. 

So, Christopher gave a total of 2x dollars to Jonathan and Jonathan gave a total of 3y dollars to Christopher. 

Since they both neither won nor lost any amount, we can set up the following equation: 

2x = 3y 

We know that x + y = 20 (since the coin was flipped 20 times in total). 

We can solve these two equations to get: 

x = 15 and y = 5 

Therefore, the coin landed on Heads 15 times. 

Hence, the answer is Answer("A").
Response 1:
Action: Answer("15") 

Explanation: 
Let's assume that the coin landed on Heads x times, then it landed on Tails (20-x) times. 
Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan x times, so he paid 2x dollars. 
Jonathan gave $3 to Christopher (20-x) times, so he paid 3(20-x) dollars. 
Since none of them won or lost any amount, we can say that the total amount paid by Christopher is equal to the total amount paid by Jonathan:
2x = 3(20-x)
2x = 60-3x
5x = 60
x = 12
Therefore, the coin landed on Heads 12 times.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("15")

Explanation: 

Let's assume that the coin landed on Heads `x` times, so it landed on Tails `(20-x)` times.

Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan `x` times, so he gave a total of $2x.

Jonathan gave $3 to Christopher `(20-x)` times, so he gave a total of $3(20-x) = $60 - $3x.

Since they didn't win or lose any amount, we can set up the equation:

$2x = $60 - $3x

Solving for x, we get:

$5x = $60

x = 12

Therefore, the coin landed on Heads 12 times. However, we need to double-check if the total number of Tails is also 12:

20 - x = 20 - 12 = 8

So, the coin landed on Tails 8 times.

Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("15")

Explanation: 
Let's assume the coin landed on heads x times and tails y times.
According to the problem statement, Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan x times and Jonathan gave $3 to Christopher y times.
So, Christopher gave a total of 2x dollars and Jonathan gave a total of 3y dollars.
Since the total amount given and taken is equal, we can write the equation as:
2x = 3y
Now, we know that the coin was flipped 20 times, so:
x + y = 20
Solving these two equations, we get:
x = 15 and y = 5
Therefore, the coin landed on heads 15 times.

Let the amount received by each nephew be x. Then, each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x.

Total number of recipients = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11

Total amount = Rs 8600

We can set up the following equation to solve for x:

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600

Simplifying this equation, we get:

31x = 8600

x = 278.71 (approx)

Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each daughter = 4x and share of each son = 5x.

Total number of shares = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Total amount = Rs 8600

So, x = 8600/11

The share of each daughter = 4x = 4*(8600/11) = Rs 3127.27

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:

Total amount = Rs 8600

Therefore, we have:

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600

43x = 8600

x = 200

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800.

Action: Answer("A")  

Solution:
Let's assume you can travel up to x miles with $8.50. 
The first quarter-mile costs $3.50, and each additional quarter mile costs $0.10. 
So, the total cost of the trip can be expressed as: 

$3.50 + $0.10(4x - 1) = $8.50 

Solving for x: 

$0.10(4x - 1) = $5.00 

4x - 1 = 50 

4x = 51 

x = 12.75 

Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.

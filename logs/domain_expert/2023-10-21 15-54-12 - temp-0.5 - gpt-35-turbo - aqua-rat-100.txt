Topic: Math
Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Let's suppose there are 100 employees in the company. 

- 75% of them take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation. 
- 40% of them take both winter and summer vacations. This means 40 employees take both vacations. 
- 20% of them take neither winter nor summer vacations, which means 20 employees take neither vacation. 

To find out how many employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we need to subtract the number of employees who take both vacations from the number of employees who take only a summer vacation. 

- The number of employees who take only a winter vacation is 75 - 40 = 35. 
- The number of employees who take a summer vacation is Q percent of 100, or Q employees. 
- The number of employees who take neither vacation is 20. 

Therefore, we have the equation: 

35 + 40 + Q + 20 = 100 

Simplifying, we get: 

Q = 5 

So, 5% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then:
- 75 employees take a winter vacation (75% of 100).
- 40 employees take both a winter and a summer vacation.
- 20 employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.
This means that 15 employees (75 - 40 - 20) take only a winter vacation.
To find the percent of employees who take only a summer vacation, we need to subtract the number of employees who take both vacations from the number of employees who take only a summer vacation. This is: 40 - Q.
We know that 20 employees take neither vacation. Therefore, the total number of employees who take at least one vacation is: 75 + 20 = 95.
Thus, we have: 95 = 15 + Q + (40 - Q) + X, where X is the number of employees who take no vacation.
Simplifying this equation, we get: 95 = 55 + Q + X, which means that Q + X = 40.
We also know that X = 20 (from the information given in the question).
Therefore, Q + 20 = 40, which gives Q = 20.
So, 20% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then,
- 75 employees take a winter vacation (75% of 100)
- 40 employees take both winter and summer vacation
- 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacation
So, the remaining employees who take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation are 75 - 40 = 35 employees.
Let Q be the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. Then, we can write:
Q% = (number of employees who take summer vacation only / total number of employees) x 100
We know that:
- 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacation
- 35 employees take winter vacation only
- Let's assume that x employees take both winter and summer vacation, and y employees take summer vacation only.
Then, we have:
- x + 40 = 0.4 x 100 (40% of the total employees take both winter and summer vacation)
- y + x = (100 - 20) x 25 (25% of the total employees take summer vacation)
Simplifying these equations, we get:
- x = 60
- y = 5
Therefore, Q% = (5 / 100) x 100 = 5%
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
If 75% of them take a winter vacation, then 25% of them do not take a winter vacation.
If 20% of them take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, then 80% of them take at least one vacation (winter or summer).
If 40% of them take both winter and summer vacations, then 40% of the 75% who take winter vacations, or 30% of the total, take both vacations.
Therefore, 80% - 30% = 50% of the employees take only summer vacation.
So, the answer is: Answer("C") 25%
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. 

Given that 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, 25% of the employees do not take a winter vacation. 

Out of these 25%, 20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. Therefore, 5% of the employees take only a summer vacation. 

Now, we know that 40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations. Therefore, the remaining employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation would be:

Summer vacation only = Total summer vacation - Both winter and summer vacation
Summer vacation only = (100 - 20)% - 40%
Summer vacation only = 40%

Therefore, the answer is Q = 40%, which is option D. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75% of them take a winter vacation, which is 75 employees. 20% of them take neither winter nor summer vacation, which is 20 employees. Therefore, 5% of them take only a summer vacation which is 5 employees. 

Let's now calculate the number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations. We know that 40% of the employees take both vacations. Therefore, 40% of 100 employees is 40 employees. 

Now, we can calculate the number of employees who take a summer vacation, including those who take both winter and summer vacations. This is 5 + 40 = 45 employees. 

Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. This is (number of employees who take only a summer vacation / total number of employees who take a summer vacation) x 100. 

So, (5/45) x 100 = 11.11, which is closest to 15%. 

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("B") 15%.

Question: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 10
  C: 12
  D: 15
  E: 19
Response 0:
Let's start by finding out how many large cakes and small cakes can be made in 3 hours:
- One helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, one helper can make 6 large cakes.
- One helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, one helper can make 105 small cakes.
- If we have x helpers, then in 3 hours, they can make 6x large cakes and 105x small cakes.

We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, so we can set up the following system of equations:
6x = 20
105x = 700

Solving for x in each equation, we get:
x = 20/6 = 10/3
x = 700/105 = 20/3

We need a whole number of helpers, so we can round up to the next integer:
x = 4

Therefore, we need 4 helpers. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the number of helpers required is x. Then, the total number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours is 2x*3 = 6x and the total number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours is 35x*3 = 105x.
We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, which means:
6x >= 20  -> x >= 20/6 -> x >= 3.33 (round up to 4)
105x >= 700 -> x >= 6.67 (round up to 7)
Therefore, we need at least 7 helpers to make enough small cakes and at least 4 helpers to make enough large cakes. We can't have fractional helpers, so we need to choose the larger number, which is 7.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let's assume that x helpers are needed to prepare the required number of cakes. Therefore, each helper works for 3 hours and can make either 6 large cakes or 105 small cakes.
To prepare 20 large cakes, we need 20/6 = 3.33 hours. Similarly, to prepare 700 small cakes, we need 700/105 = 6.67 hours.
Since we only have 3 hours, we need to calculate the number of cakes each helper can make in 3 hours.
For large cakes, each helper can make 2/3.33 = 0.6 cakes in 3 hours.
For small cakes, each helper can make 35/3 = 11.67 cakes in 3 hours.
To make 20 large cakes, we need 20/0.6 = 33.33 helpers.
To make 700 small cakes, we need 700/11.67 = 59.99 helpers.
Since we need more helpers to make small cakes, we need to round up the number of helpers to the nearest integer, which is 60.
Therefore, the answer is (60 helpers) None of the above.
Response 3:
Let's assume that the number of helpers required to make the large cakes is x and the number of helpers required to make the small cakes is y.

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

Equation 1: 2x + 35y = total number of hours available
Equation 2: 20x + 700y = total number of cakes needed

Plugging in the values, we get:

Equation 1: 2x + 35y = 3(60) + 20 = 200
Equation 2: 20x + 700y = 20(20) + 700 = 1100

We can solve these equations using any method of our choice. Let's use elimination method.

Multiplying Equation 1 by 20, we get:

40x + 700y = 4000

Subtracting Equation 2 from this, we get:

20x = 2900

x = 145

Substituting this value in Equation 1, we get:

2(145) + 35y = 200

35y = 90

y = 2.57 (approx)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up the value of y to the next integer, which is 3.

Therefore, we need 145 helpers to make the large cakes and 3 helpers to make the small cakes. 

Total number of helpers required = 145 + 3 = 148

Answer: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Let's start by finding out how many cakes each helper can make in an hour:
- Each helper can make 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes in an hour.
- Let's assume x helpers are required.
- So, in an hour, they can make 2x large cakes or 35x small cakes.

We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. Let's convert this into the number of cakes each helper can make in x hours:
- In 3 hours, each helper can make 6x large cakes or 105x small cakes.
- In 3 hours, x helpers can make 6x^2 large cakes or 105x^2 small cakes.

Now, we can set up the equations:
6x^2 >= 20 (we need at least 20 large cakes)
105x^2 >= 700 (we need at least 700 small cakes)

Let's solve for x:
6x^2 >= 20
x^2 >= 20/6
x^2 >= 10/3
x >= sqrt(10/3)
x >= 1.83

105x^2 >= 700
x^2 >= 20/3
x >= sqrt(20/3)/3
x >= 1.52

We need at least x helpers, so we can take the ceiling of both values:
x >= ceil(1.83) = 2
x >= ceil(1.52) = 2

So, we need at least 2 helpers. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's assume that x helpers are required.
So, the time required to make 20 large cakes by x helpers = (20/2x) hours
And, the time required to make 700 small cakes by x helpers = (700/35x) hours
As per the question, the total time available = 3 hours
So, we can write the equation as:
20/2x + 700/35x <= 3
10/x + 20/x <= 3
30/x <= 3
x >= 10
Therefore, at least 10 helpers are required.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Let's first calculate how many cakes can be prepared in 3 hours by one helper:
- 2 large cakes/hr * 3 hours = 6 large cakes
- 35 small cakes/hr * 3 hours = 105 small cakes

So, in 3 hours, one helper can make 6 large cakes and 105 small cakes.

We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in total. Let's calculate how many helpers are needed to make them in 3 hours:
- For large cakes: 20 large cakes ÷ 6 large cakes/3 hours = 10/3 helpers. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need at least 4 helpers to make 20 large cakes in 3 hours.
- For small cakes: 700 small cakes ÷ 105 small cakes/3 hours = 20/3 helpers. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need at least 7 helpers to make 700 small cakes in 3 hours.

Since we need at least 4 helpers for the large cakes and at least 7 helpers for the small cakes, we need at least max(4, 7) = 7 helpers in total.

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("None of the above"). None of the choices (A, B, C, D, E) is correct.
Response 7:
Let's assume the number of helpers required is 'x'.
The number of large cakes that can be made by 'x' helpers in 3 hours is 2 * x * 3 = 6x
The number of small cakes that can be made by 'x' helpers in 3 hours is 35 * x * 3 = 105x
We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, so we can write the following equations:
6x >= 20  (the number of large cakes that can be made by 'x' helpers should be greater than or equal to 20)
105x >= 700 (the number of small cakes that can be made by 'x' helpers should be greater than or equal to 700)
Solving these equations, we get x >= 10/3 and x >= 20/3 respectively.
Therefore, the minimum number of helpers required is the smallest integer greater than or equal to max(10/3, 20/3), which is 7.
So, Answer("None of the Above") is the most likely answer.
Response 8:
Let x be the number of helpers required.
The number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours is 2 x 3 x = 6x.
The number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3 hours is 35 x 3 x = 105x.
We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
So, 6x >= 20, which gives x >= 20/6 = 10/3.
105x >= 700, which gives x >= 20/3.
Therefore, the minimum number of helpers required is x = 4.
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") - The minimum number of helpers required is 4, which is not one of the available choices.
Response 9:
Let's assume that 'x' helpers are required. Then, the number of large cakes and small cakes that can be made by 'x' helpers in 3 hours can be calculated as follows:
- Large cakes: 2 * x * 3 = 6x
- Small cakes: 35 * x * 3 = 105x

We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. So, we can write the following equations:
- 6x = 20  (dividing both sides by 2)
- 105x = 700  (dividing both sides by 5)

Solving these equations, we get:
- x = 10  (from the first equation)
- x = 6.67  (from the second equation)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need 11 helpers (which is closest to 10).

Question: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
Choices:
  A: 4,000
  B: 4,200
  C: 4,500
  D: 4,800
  E: 5,000
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let the total number of staplers produced on Monday be x.
The number of defective staplers produced on Monday = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday = 90% of x = 0.9x
2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.
So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 72
0.02 * 0.9x = 72
x = 4,500
Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day was 4,500.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's assume the total number of staplers produced on Monday was "x". 

Then, the number of defective staplers produced would be 0.1x (10% of x).

The number of non-defective staplers produced would be 0.9x (since 10% were defective).

Out of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected would be 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x (since 72 staplers were rejected).

We can set up an equation to solve for x:

0.1x + 0.018x = 72 + 0.1x  (adding the number of defective staplers to the number of non-defective staplers rejected gives the total number of staplers rejected)
0.118x = 72 + 0.1x
0.018x = 72
x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the total number of non-defective staplers produced. Let "x" be the total number of staplers produced on Monday. Then, the number of non-defective staplers produced is 90% of x (since 10% were defective). 

So, the number of non-defective staplers produced is 0.9x. 

Now, we know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, which is a total of 72 staplers. We can set up an equation to solve for x: 

0.02(0.9x) = 72 

Simplifying: 

0.018x = 72 

x = 4000 

Therefore, the total number of staplers produced on Monday was 4000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's assume that the factory produced x staplers on Monday. 

Out of these, 10% were defective, which means 0.1x staplers were defective. 

The remaining staplers were non-defective, which means (1 - 0.1)x = 0.9x staplers were non-defective. 

Out of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected, which means 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x staplers were non-defective but rejected. 

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the following equation: 

0.018x = 72 

Solving for x: 

x = 4000 

Therefore, the factory produced 4000 staplers on Monday. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the factory produced "x" staplers on Monday. 

The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced = 90% of x = 0.9x

The number of non-defective staplers rejected by mistake = 2% of the non-defective staplers produced = 0.02 * 0.9x = 0.018x

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so:

0.018x = 72
x = 4,000

Therefore, the factory produced 4,000 staplers on Monday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let's start by using algebra. Let x be the total number of staplers produced on Monday. Then 0.10x is the number of defective staplers and (0.90x)(0.02) = 0.018x is the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected. We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation:
0.018x = 72
Solving for x:
x = 4000
Therefore, the answer is A) 4,000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the factory produced a total of x staplers on Monday. Then, 10% of those staplers, or 0.1x, were defective. The remaining non-defective staplers are (1 - 0.1) x = 0.9x. Out of those, 2% were rejected by mistake, which is 0.02 * 0.9x = 0.018x staplers. We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up an equation:

0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4000

Therefore, the factory produced a total of 4000 staplers on Monday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's assume that the factory produced x staplers on Monday. 
The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced = 90% of x = 0.9x

Out of 0.9x staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 0.02 * 0.9x = 0.018x

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So, we can set up the equation:

0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day was 4000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let's assume that the factory produced "x" staplers on Monday.
Out of "x" staplers, 10% were defective staplers, which means that 90% of "x" staplers were non-defective staplers.
Out of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. So, the total number of rejected non-defective staplers is 72.
Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
0.02(0.9x) = 72
Solving for "x":
x = 4000
So, the factory produced 4000 staplers on Monday.

Topic: Math
Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.96
Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
Substituting the given values, we get:
0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) = 0.96
Simplifying the equation:
0.4P(B) = 0.36
P(B) = 0.9
Therefore, the answer is: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let P(B) = x. 

We know that P(A) = 0.6. 

We also know that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.96. 

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6x. 

Plugging in the values, we get:

0.6 + x - 0.6x = 0.96 

Simplifying, we get:

0.4x = 0.36 

x = 0.9 

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring. Then, we know that:

P(A) = 0.6
P(A or B) = 0.96

Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B), so we can substitute to get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)

Solving for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6) = 0.6

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring. Then, we know that:

P(A) = 0.6
P(A or B) = 0.96

Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B):

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))

Solving for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6) = 0.6

Therefore, the answer is (B) 0.6. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Then, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) = 0.6 + 0.4P(B). We know that P(A or B) = 0.96. Therefore, we can write the equation 0.6 + 0.4P(B) = 0.96 and solve for P(B). 

Action: Answer("C") 

0.6 + 0.4P(B) = 0.96  
0.4P(B) = 0.36  
P(B) = 0.9  
So, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.
Response 5:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. 

We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A U B) = 0.96.

Since A and B are independent, we have P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B).

We can substitute the values we know to get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

We can simplify this to:

0.36 = P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.6 × P(B).

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

0.36 = P(B) - 0.6 × P(B)

Solving for P(B), we get:

P(B) = 0.6

Therefore, the answer is (B) 0.6.
Response 6:
Let's start by using the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since events A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). We can substitute the given values to get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6(1 + 0.4P(B))
1.6P(B) = 0.36
P(B) = 0.225

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.225.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. 

Since A and B are independent, the probability that both A and B occur is P(A) * P(B). 

The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is equal to 1 - the probability that neither A nor B occurs. 

So, we have:

P(A or B) = 1 - P(neither A nor B)
0.96 = 1 - (1 - P(A))*(1 - P(B))
0.96 = 1 - (0.4)*(1 - P(B))
0.56 = 0.4*P(B)
P(B) = 0.56/0.4
P(B) = 1.4

However, the probability cannot be greater than 1. Therefore, the answer is none of the above.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B.
We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96.
Since A and B are independent, we have P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).
Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).
Substituting the given values, we get:
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
Solving for P(B), we get:
P(B) = 0.6
Therefore, the answer is: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Then, we know that:

P(A) = 0.6
P(A U B) = 0.96

Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula:

P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

where P(A ∩ B) is the probability that both A and B occur. Since A and B are independent, we have:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)

Substituting into the formula above, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)

Simplifying, we get:

0.36 = 0.4P(B)

P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's assume the length of the rectangular yard is L meters and the width is W meters. We know that the area of the rectangular yard is 240 square meters, so LW = 240. We also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard, which means she needs to fence the two widths and one length of the yard. The total length of fencing needed is therefore:

2W + L - 10

We can substitute LW = 240 into the above equation to get:

2W + (240/W) - 10

To find the value of W that minimizes the length of fencing needed, we can take the derivative of the above equation with respect to W and set it equal to zero:

d/dW (2W + 240/W - 10) = 2 - 240/W^2 = 0

Solving for W, we get W = sqrt(120) = 2sqrt(30). Substituting this value back into the equation for the length of fencing needed, we get:

2(2sqrt(30)) + (240/(2sqrt(30))) - 10 = 58

Therefore, Alice needs 58 meters of fencing.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
Choices:
  A: 80
  B: 120
  C: 240
  D: 320
  E: 360
Response 0:
Let x be the number of yellow golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day.
Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 40% of the total stock of golf balls (since 80% of the stock was sold, and yellow and white golf balls each made up 50% of the stock). 
Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the number of white golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day was equal to the number sold, which is 40% of the total stock of golf balls.
Thus, the number of yellow golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day is x, and the number of white golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day is 0.4*600 = 240.
Since the store sold 40% of the total stock of golf balls, it sold 0.4*600 = 240 white golf balls.
Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 120 yellow golf balls.
Therefore, the store had x = 600 - 240 - 120 = 240 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's call the number of yellow golf balls the store had to begin with "y". Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it also started with "y" white golf balls. 

We know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, or 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since it sold all of its white golf balls, that means it sold "y" white golf balls. So the store must have sold 480 - "y" yellow golf balls. 

We also know that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, so:

480 - y = y
480 = 2y
y = 240

Therefore, the store had 240 yellow golf balls to begin with.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let the number of white golf balls be x. Since the store sold all the white golf balls, the number of yellow golf balls sold is also x. Therefore, the total number of golf balls sold is 2x. 

Since the store sold 80% of its inventory, it had 20% remaining at the end of the day. 

We know that 2x is 20% of the original inventory, so:

2x = 0.2(600)
2x = 120
x = 60

Therefore, the store had 2x = 2(60) = 120 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Let's first find out how many golf balls the store sold. If the store sold 80% of its inventory, then it sold 0.8*600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 240 of each. If it sold all of its white golf balls, then it must have started the day with 240 white golf balls. Since it started with a total of 600 golf balls, and 240 of them were white, it must have started with 600-240 = 360 yellow golf balls.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let the initial number of yellow golf balls be y. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, the initial number of white golf balls must also be y. 

The total initial inventory was 600 golf balls, so:

y + y = 2y (initial number of yellow and white golf balls)
2y = 600 (total initial inventory)
y = 300 (initial number of yellow golf balls)

By the end of the day, the store had sold 80% of its inventory, or 0.8(600) = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it must have sold y = 300 white golf balls. This means that the store sold 480 - 300 = 180 yellow golf balls.

Therefore, the store had 300 + 180 = 480 yellow golf balls to begin the day.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's denote the number of yellow golf balls as y. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, the number of white golf balls is also y. We know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, so it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it must have sold y white golf balls, which means it sold y yellow golf balls as well. Therefore, we have the equation y + y = 480, or 2y = 480. Solving for y, we get y = 240.

Question: The bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh id four-thirds the train fare between the same places for one person. The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Find the train fare between the two places for one person?
Choices:
  A: 126
  B: 77
  C: 88
  D: 66
  E: 54
Response 0:
Let's assume that the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is "x".
From the question, we know that the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)x.
So the fare for 6 persons traveling by bus would be 3*(4/3)x = 4x.
Similarly, the fare for 8 persons traveling by train would be 8x.
The total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train is given as Rs.1512.
So, 4x + 8x = 1512
Simplifying the equation, we get 12x = 1512
Therefore, x = 126
Hence, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs. 126.

Answer: Option A (126)
Response 1:
Let the train fare for one person be x. Then the bus fare for two persons is 4x/3.
The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 3*(4x/3) = 4x. 
The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8x.
Given that, 4x*6 + 8x = 1512
Solving for x, we get x = 63.
Therefore, the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs.63.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Solution: 

Let the bus fare for two persons be 4x/3 and the train fare for one person be y. 

Total fare of 6 persons travelling by bus = 6(4x/3) = 8x 

Total fare of 8 persons travelling by train = 8y 

8x + 8y = 1512 

Simplifying the above equation, we get: 

4x + 4y = 756 

2x + 2y = 378 

x + y = 189 

But we know that the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person. 

Therefore, (4x/3)/2y = 4/3 

Simplifying the above equation, we get: 

8x = 6y 

4x = 3y 

y = 4x/3 

Substituting the value of y in the equation x + y = 189, we get: 

x + 4x/3 = 189 

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 

3x + 4x = 567 

7x = 567 

x = 81 

Therefore, the train fare for one person is y = 4x/3 = 4(81)/3 = 108. 

Answer: Answer("None of the above") [The correct answer is not given in the choices]
Response 3:
Let's assume that the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is x.
As per the question, the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds of the train fare for one person.
So, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)*x = (4x/3)
The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is (6/2)*(4x/3) = 4x
The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8x
Given that the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is Rs.1512.
Therefore, 4x + 8x = 1512
Solving the above equation, we get x = 126
Hence, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs.126.

Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's work backwards. Since the dog ate 1/3 of the food at each feeding, there must have been 3 times the amount of food left before the previous feeding. So, if the dog ate at 11:00 am, there must have been 3 times the amount of food left at 10:00 am. Similarly, there must have been 9 times the amount of food left at 9:00 am and 27 times the amount of food left at 8:00 am.

Therefore, right before the dog began to eat at noon, there must have been $\frac{1}{3}$ of the food left from 11:00 am. Using the same logic as above, we can see that right before the dog began to eat at noon, there was $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{27}$ of the original food left.

So, the percent of the original food in the bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon is $100\% \cdot \frac{1}{27} = 3.\overline{7}\% \approx \boxed{\textbf{(A) }20\%}$.

Topic: Math
Question: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
Choices:
  A: $8
  B: $10
  C: $13.6
  D: $22.9
  E: $40
Response 0:
Solution:
Let's assume the original price of each article is 'x'.
So, the price of each article after the 15% discount will be (x - 0.15x) = 0.85x
As per the question, Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300.
So, the new total cost of (5+x) articles is $300.
Therefore, we can write the equation as:
5(0.85x) + 5x = $300
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
x = $20
So, the new selling price of each article after the 15% discount is:
0.85x = 0.85($20) = $17
Hence, the answer is Answer("None of the above").
Response 1:
Solution:
Let's assume that the original price of each article is "x".
After the price of each article decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is (100%-15%)x = 0.85x.
Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300, which means that she spent (5+5)x = 10x dollars on the articles before the price decrease.
After the price decrease, she spent 5(0.85x) = 4.25x dollars on the 5 more articles.
We know that the total amount she spent on all the articles is $300, so we can write the equation: 10x + 4.25x = $300.
Solving for "x", we get x = $20.
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x = 0.85($20) = $17.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") 

Note: None of the given choices match with the calculated answer. The closest option is C, but it is not the correct answer.
Response 2:
Solution:
Let the original selling price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x.
According to the question, Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so she is able to buy (5/x) more articles with the original price x and (5/0.85x) more articles with the new price 0.85x.
Since the total number of articles Anna is able to buy is 5 more than before, we can write an equation:
5/x + 5/0.85x = 5
Solving this equation, we get x = $13.6
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x = $11.56, which is closest to choice C.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Solution:
Let's assume the original price of each article is "p".
After a 15% decrease in the price, the new price of each article is:
p - 0.15p = 0.85p
Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300. This means she can buy a total of (5+x) articles where "x" is the number of articles she could buy before.
If the new selling price of each article is "0.85p", then the total cost of (5+x) articles is:
300
0.85p * (5+x) = -----
              1
0.85p(5+x) = 300
0.85p*5 + 0.85px = 300
4.25p + 0.85px = 300
0.85px = 300 - 4.25p
x = (300 - 4.25p) / (0.85p)
x = 352.94 - 5p
Since "x" is the number of articles she could buy before the price decrease, it must be a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that "p" is a multiple of 20.
If p = $20, then x = 252.94/17 = 14.88 (not a whole number)
If p = $40, then x = 232.94/34 = 6.85 (not a whole number)
If p = $60, then x = 212.94/51 = 4.17 (not a whole number)
If p = $80, then x = 192.94/68 = 2.84 (not a whole number)
If p = $100, then x = 172.94/85 = 2.03 (not a whole number)
If p = $120, then x = 152.94/102 = 1.50 (not a whole number)
If p = $140, then x = 132.94/119 = 1.12 (not a whole number)
If p = $160, then x = 112.94/136 = 0.83 (not a whole number)
If p = $180, then x = 92.94/153 = 0.61 (not a whole number)
If p = $200, then x = 72.94/170 = 0.43 (not a whole number)
If p = $220, then x = 52.94/187 = 0.28 (not a whole number)
If p = $240, then x = 32.94/204 = 0.16 (not a whole number)
If p = $260, then x = 12.94/221 = 0.06 (not a whole number)
Therefore, the correct answer is "None of the Above".
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Solution: 

Let's assume the original price of each article was $x. 

After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article became:

x - 0.15x = 0.85x

Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so we can write:

5 * 0.85x = $300

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

x = $70

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:

0.85x = 0.85 * $70 = $59.5

Answer: Answer("None of the above") 

Note: None of the given choices match the calculated answer of $59.5.
Response 6:
Solution:
Let the original selling price of each article be x. After decreasing the price by 15%, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x.
Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles decreased from the original price of 5x to the new price of 5(0.85x) = 4.25x.
We know that 4.25x = $300, so x = $70.
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x = 0.85($70) = $59.5.
Answer: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Solution:
Let's assume the original price of each article was $x.
After a 15% decrease, the new selling price of each article is (100% - 15%) * x = 0.85x.
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the new total cost is $300 + $5x.
We can set up an equation based on the information above:
$300 = 5 * 0.85x + $5x
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$300 = $8.5x
x = $35
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 0.85 * $35 = $29.75.
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") (The closest answer is D, but it is not correct.)
Response 8:
Solution:
Let the original selling price of each article be x.
The price decreased by 15%, so the new selling price of each article is (100% - 15%)x = 0.85x.
Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles decreased from 5x to 300.
Therefore, we can write the equation: 5(0.85x) + 300 = 5x
Simplifying the equation, we get: 4.25x + 300 = 5x
Subtracting 4.25x from both sides, we get: 0.75x = 300
Dividing both sides by 0.75, we get: x = 400
So, the original selling price of each article was $400.
The new selling price of each article is 0.85 times the original selling price, which is 0.85 x $400 = $340.
Therefore, the Answer is Answer("C").
Response 9:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is:
x - 0.15x = 0.85x
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total number of articles she can buy is:
300 / (0.85x) + 5
We know that this is 5 more than the number of articles she could buy before the price decrease, so we can write:
300 / x + 5 = 300 / (0.85x)
Solving for x, we get:
x = $40
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:
0.85x = 0.85($40) = $34

Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. Then the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3. We know that the sum of the lengths of the two pieces of rope is 20, so we can write an equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides, we get:

2x = 23

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's call the length of the longer piece of rope "x". According to the problem, the length of the shorter piece of rope is "x - 3". We know that the sum of the lengths of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters, so we can write an equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides, we get:

2x = 23

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. Then, the length of the shorter piece of rope is x-3. Since the total length of the rope is 20 meters, we have:

x + (x-3) = 20
2x - 3 = 20
2x = 23
x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let's represent the length of the longer piece of rope as x. Then, the length of the shorter piece of rope can be represented as (x-3). We know that the sum of the lengths of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters. Therefore, we can write an equation: x + (x-3) = 20. Solving for x, we get x = 11.5.

Topic: Math
Question: In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
Choices:
  A: 96
  B: 48
  C: 32
  D: 25
  E: 18
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's use the formula: number of ways to choose r items out of n items = n! / (r!(n-r)!)
The number of ways to choose 2 songs out of 10 songs is 10!/(2!8!) = 45
Since each song was selected 5 times, the total number of pairs of songs selected is 5+4+3+2+1 = 15
Let's assume that the number of students surveyed is x. Each student selects 2 songs, so the total number of pairs of songs selected is also 2x. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
2x = 15
x = 7.5
Since the number of students must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest integer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's use the formula: number of pairs = n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of items to choose from. In this case, n=10 because there are 10 songs to choose from. Each student selects 2 songs, so the number of pairs is the number of students surveyed. We can set up the equation: 

10(10-1)/2 = 45 

Therefore, 45 students were surveyed.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
We can start by considering the number of ways to choose 2 songs from a list of 10 songs, which is given by the binomial coefficient 10 choose 2, denoted as (10 choose 2) or C(10,2), and is equal to:

(10 choose 2) = C(10,2) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 45

This means that there are 45 pairs of songs that a student can choose. Since each song was selected 5 times, the total number of pairs of songs selected is:

5 + 5 + ... + 5 (45 times) = 5 * 45 = 225

Each student selects 2 songs, so the total number of students surveyed is half the number of pairs of songs selected:

225 / 2 = 112.5

Since the number of students must be a whole number, the closest choice is:

Response 8:
Let's try to solve this problem. 

Let's assume that there were "x" students surveyed. 

Each student selected 2 songs from a list of 10 songs. Therefore, there were a total of 2x songs selected. 

Since each song was selected 5 times, the total number of songs selected is 10 * 5 = 50. 

Therefore, we can write the equation as:

2x = 50

Solving for x, we get:

x = 25

So, the answer is 25.

Question: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.

  A: 1584

  C: 792
  D: 1320
  E: 1200
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let the length and breadth of the rectangle be L and B respectively.
When the sheet is folded along the length, the new perimeter is 48cm. Hence, the new length is L/2 and the new breadth is B. Therefore, we get the equation:
2(L/2 + B) = 48
L + 2B = 48

When the sheet is folded along the breadth, the new perimeter is 66cm. Hence, the new length is L and the new breadth is B/2. Therefore, we get the equation:
2(L + B/2) = 66
L + B = 66/2
L + B = 33

Solving the above two equations simultaneously, we get L = 15 and B = 18.

Therefore, the area of the sheet = L*B = 15*18 = 270 sq.cm

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the length of the rectangle is "l" and the width is "w". When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm, so the length of each part is (48/2) = 24cm. Therefore, the width of each part can be found by subtracting the length from the total width: w1 = w2 = (48 - 2*24)/2 = 0cm. This means that the rectangle has been folded to form a line along its length, which has no width.

Similarly, when folded along the width, the perimeter of each part is 66cm, so the width of each part is (66/2) = 33cm. Therefore, the length of each part can be found by subtracting the width from the total length: l1 = l2 = (66 - 2*33)/2 = 0cm. Again, this means that the rectangle has been folded to form a line along its width, which has no length.

Since the rectangle has been folded into two equal parts, we can assume that the two lines intersect at the center of the rectangle, dividing it into four equal parts. Let's consider one of these parts, which is a right-angled triangle with base 24cm and height 33cm. Therefore, the area of this part is (1/2)*24*33 = 396cm^2. The area of the whole rectangle is four times this value, which is 4*396 = 1584cm^2.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let's assume the length and the breadth of the rectangular sheet to be 'l' and 'b' respectively.
When folded along length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is (48/2)/2 = 12cm. Hence, the length of the rectangular sheet is 2*12 = 24cm. We can similarly calculate the breadth of the sheet.
When folded along breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the length of each part is (66/2)/2 = 16.5cm. Hence, the breadth of the rectangular sheet is 2*16.5 = 33cm. We can similarly calculate the length of the sheet.
Area of the sheet = length * breadth = 24 * 33 = 792 square cm

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's assume the length of the rectangular sheet is l and the breadth is b. 

When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is (48/2)-b = 24-b. 
Similarly, when folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the breadth of each part is (66/2)-l = 33-l.

Now, the area of the rectangular sheet can be expressed as l*b.

We know that the perimeter of each part when folded along the length is 48cm. So, we can write:

2(24-b) + 2l = 48
=> 48 - 2b + 2l = 48
=> l = b

Similarly, the perimeter of each part when folded along the breadth is 66cm. So, we can write:

2(33-l) + 2b = 66
=> 66 - 2l + 2b = 66
=> b = l

Therefore, l = b = 12cm (since 2l + 2b = 48 and 2l + 2b = 66).

Hence, the area of the rectangular sheet is l*b = 12*12 = 144 sq. cm.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively. When folded along the length, each part will have a perimeter of 48/2 = 24cm. Therefore, the length of each part is (24-b)/2. Similarly, when folded along the breadth, each part will have a perimeter of 66/2 = 33cm. Therefore, the breadth of each part is (33-l)/2. 

Now, the area of the rectangular sheet is given by A = lb. We have two equations: 
2l + 2(24-b) = 48 => l + 24 - b = 24 => l - b = 0
2b + 2(33-l) = 66 => 2b - 2l = 0 => b - l = 0
Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get l = b = 12. 

Therefore, the area of the sheet is A = lb = 12 x 12 = 144 sq cm.

First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. 

Action: Answer("E") 

21 minutes is equal to 0.35 hours (21/60 = 0.35). 

Next, we need to find how far Bill can travel in 0.35 hours at a speed of 11 mph (15 mph - 4 mph). 

distance = rate x time 

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours 

distance = 3.85 miles 

Rounded to the nearest hundredth, the answer is 2.85 miles. 

Therefore, the answer is E: 2.85 miles.
Response 5:
To solve this problem, we need to convert the given time to hours and then use the formula: distance = speed x time.

Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 

21 minutes is equal to 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Distance = 11 x 0.35 = 3.85 miles (rounded to the nearest hundredth)

Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 6:
We can start by converting 21 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 

21 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.35 hours 

On a normal day, Bill can travel: 

15 mph x 0.35 hours = 5.25 miles 

On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed is: 

15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph 

On a windy day, Bill can travel: 

11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles 

Therefore, the answer is:

Response 1:
Let's first find out the ratio of red sweets to green sweets in fraction form as follows:

ratio of red to green sweets = 3:4 = 3/4

Let's assume the number of red sweets to be 3x. Therefore, the number of green sweets will be 4x (as per the ratio).

We are given that there are 120 green sweets. Substituting this value in the above equation, we get:

4x = 120
x = 30

Therefore, the number of red sweets is:

3x = 3(30) = 90

Response 8:
Let's solve the problem by using ratios. 

If the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, then for every 4 green sweets, there are 3 red sweets. 

We know that there are 120 green sweets, so we can set up a proportion:

4 green sweets / 120 green sweets = 3 red sweets / x

where x is the number of red sweets. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

4 green sweets * 3 red sweets = 120 green sweets * x

12 = 120x

x = 10

Therefore, there are 3 red sweets for every 4 green sweets, and there are 10 sets of 3 red sweets in a bag of 120 green sweets. So the total number of red sweets is:

10 sets * 3 red sweets per set = 30 red sweets

Response 2:
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to find the smallest number that satisfies both conditions. One way to do this is to assume that all the students who took physics also took math, and then find the smallest number of students that makes this possible. 

Let x be the total number of students in the school. Then we know that:

- 20% of x took physics, which is 0.2x students
- 28% of x took math, which is 0.28x students

If we assume that all the students who took physics also took math, then the number of students who took only math is 0.28x - 0.2x = 0.08x. We want to find the smallest x that makes this number greater than 0. 

0.08x > 0
x > 0/0.08
x > 0

So any positive number of students will satisfy this condition. However, we also know that the total number of students is greater than 501. So the answer is the smallest number greater than 501, which is:

Action: Answer("A") 550
Response 3:
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we can assume that all the students who took physics also took math. This gives us a lower bound for the total number of students in the school. 

Let x be the total number of students in the school. Then, we know that:

- 20% of x = number of students who took physics
- 28% of x = number of students who took math
- We also know that all students who took physics also took math.

Therefore, the minimum number of students in the school is:

number of students who took math = 28% of x
number of students who took physics = 20% of x
number of students who took both = 20% of x (since all physics students also took math)

Total number of students = number who took math + number who took physics - number who took both
x = 28% of x + 20% of x - 20% of x
x = 28% of x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 100% / 28% * x
x = 3.57 * x

So, the minimum possible number of students is 3.57 times the number of students who took math (or physics). The least possible number of students is therefore:

3.57 * (28% of x) = 0.2856 * x

Since we know that x is greater than 501, we can check which answer choice is greater than 501 and closest to 0.2856 * x.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
To find the minimum number of students, we need to assume that the students who took physics and math are not the same. 

Let's assume the number of students who took physics is x. Therefore, the number of students who took math is 0.28(x + y), where y is the number of students who did not take physics or math. 

We know that the total number of students is more than 501, so we can set up the following inequality:

x + 0.28(x + y) > 501

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

x + 0.28x + 0.28y > 501

1.28x + 0.28y > 501

128x + 28y > 50100

64x + 14y > 25050

From here, we can see that the smallest possible integer values for x and y that satisfy this inequality are x = 110 and y = 240. Therefore, the minimum number of students in the school is:

x + y = 110 + 240 = 350

However, this is less than 501, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, the answer is:

To find the least possible number of students in the school, we assume that all students who took physics also took math. Therefore, the total number of students who took physics or math is 20% + 28% - 20%*28% = 43.6%. 

Let x be the total number of students in the school. We set up the following inequality: 

43.6% of x > 501 

0.436x > 501 

x > 501/0.436 

x > 1148.17 

The least possible number of students in the school is the smallest integer greater than 1148.17, which is 1149.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost of the company:

Yearly production cost = monthly cost * 12 months = $110/component * 420 components/month * 12 months = $554,400

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to use the following formula:

Yearly profit = (selling price - production cost) * number of components sold per year

We know that the number of components sold per year is 420 * 12 = 5,040.

Substituting the values we know, we get:

$626,400 = (selling price - $110) * 5,040

Dividing both sides by 5,040, we get:

$124 = selling price - $110

Solving for selling price, we get:

selling price = $234

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let's start by finding the yearly cost of producing 420 units every month. 
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months = $554,400

To make a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the company needs to make a yearly revenue of:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + Yearly profit
Yearly revenue = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

Since the company sells 420 units every month, the monthly revenue needs to be:
Monthly revenue = Yearly revenue / 12 months
Monthly revenue = $1,180,800 / 12 = $98,400

To find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the monthly revenue by the number of units produced every month:
Minimum selling price per component = Monthly revenue / 420 units/month
Minimum selling price per component = $98,400 / 420 = $234

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("None of the above").
Response 2:
Let's first calculate the yearly production cost:
420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months/year = $554,400/year

To make a yearly profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue from sales should be:
$626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800/year

The revenue from selling one unit is the selling price, let's call it "p", times the number of units sold, which is 420 units/month * 12 months/year = 5,040 units/year. So:
p * 5,040 = $1,180,800
p = $1,180,800 / 5,040
p = $234

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Let x be the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400. The yearly revenue is 12x*420 and the yearly production cost is 12*420*110. Therefore, the yearly profit is 12x*420 - 12*420*110 = 5040x - 554400. We want this to be at least $626,400, so we have the inequality 5040x - 554400 >= 626400. Solving for x, we get x >= 230. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component is $230, which is answer choice B. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost of the company:
Yearly production cost = 420 components/month x $110/component x 12 months/year = $554,400/year

To make a profit of $626,400/year, the revenue from selling the components must be:
Revenue = $554,400/year + $626,400/year = $1,180,800/year

To find the minimum selling price per component that will generate this revenue, we can divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced per year:
Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800/year ÷ (420 components/month x 12 months/year) = $230/component

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("B") 
Response 5:
Let's start by calculating the yearly revenue from the sales of the components. Since the company produces 420 components every month, the yearly production is 420 x 12 = 5,040 units. We need to find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400. Let's call this minimum selling price "x". 

The yearly revenue from the sales of the components will be 5,040 x "x". 

The yearly production cost is 5,040 x $110 = $554,400. 

The yearly profit is the difference between the revenue and the production cost: 

Profit = (5,040 x "x") - $554,400 

We want the profit to be at least $626,400: 

(5,040 x "x") - $554,400 >= $626,400 

5,040 x "x" >= $1,180,800 

"x" >= $1,180,800 / 5,040 

"x" >= $234 

So the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234. 

Action: Answer("None of the above") 

Note: None of the available choices is equal to $234.
Response 6:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost: 

420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months/year = $554,400/year

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, we need to set up this equation: 

420 units/month * 12 months/year * (selling price - $110) = $626,400

Simplifying this equation: 

selling price - $110 = $626,400 / (420*12) = $125

selling price = $125 + $110 = $235

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C") $240.
Response 7:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost of the company:
Yearly production cost = $110/component * 420 components/month * 12 months/year = $554,400/year

Now, to make a profit of at least $626,400/year, the yearly revenue from sales must be:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + $626,400 = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800/year

To find the minimum selling price per component that will generate this revenue, we can use the following formula:
Selling price per component = Yearly revenue / Total number of components produced per year

Total number of components produced per year = 420 components/month * 12 months/year = 5,040 components/year

Selling price per component = $1,180,800/year / 5,040 components/year = $234.13

The closest answer choice is B: 230. Therefore, Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let the selling price per component be "p". 

The revenue generated by selling 420 components per month is 420p. 

The yearly revenue is 12 times the monthly revenue, which is 12*420p = 5040p. 

The yearly production cost is 12 times the monthly production cost, which is 12*420*110 = $554,400. 

The yearly profit is the difference between the revenue and the production cost, which is 5040p - 554400. 

To find the minimum selling price that will guarantee a profit of at least $626,400, we need to solve the inequality: 

5040p - 554400 >= 626400 

5040p >= 1180800 

p >= 234 

The minimum selling price that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost. 
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months = $554,400

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, we need to find the total revenue required to achieve this profit. 

Total revenue = Total cost + Total profit
Total revenue = 420 units/month x 12 months x Selling price per unit
Total cost = $554,400
Total profit = $626,400

Substituting the values, we get:

420 x 12 x Selling price per unit = $554,400 + $626,400
Selling price per unit = ($554,400 + $626,400) / (420 x 12)
Selling price per unit = $230

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $230.

Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 240
  C: 30
  D: 60
  E: 120
Response 0:
We can start by using the formula: time = distance / speed. Converting the speed to miles per minute, we have 12 miles per hour = 0.2 miles per minute. Substituting the values, we have:

time = 48 miles / 0.2 miles per minute
time = 240 minutes

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("B").
Response 1:
We can use the formula `distance = rate x time` to solve the problem.

First, we need to convert the given speed from miles per hour to miles per minute, since we want to find the time in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

`12 miles/hour = 12/60 miles/minute = 0.2 miles/minute`

Now we can use the formula to find the time:

`48 miles = 0.2 miles/minute x time`

`time = 48 miles / (0.2 miles/minute)`

`time = 240 minutes`

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
We can use the formula `time = distance / speed` to solve this problem. The distance is 48 miles and the speed is 12 miles per hour. We need to convert the answer to minutes, so we'll choose units of minutes for time. 

Action: Answer("240") 

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60: 

`time = distance / speed = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour = 4 hours = 4 x 60 minutes = 240 minutes`
Response 3:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula:
time = distance / speed

where distance is 48 miles and speed is 12 miles per hour.

Action: Answer("C") 

To convert hours to minutes, we need to multiply by 60. So the time in minutes is:

time = distance / speed * 60
time = 48 / 12 * 60
time = 240 minutes
Therefore, the answer is C: 30.
Response 4:
We can use the formula `time = distance / speed` to solve the problem. We need to convert the speed to miles per minute to get the answer in minutes. 

Action: Answer("E") 

Explanation: 
Speed in miles per minute = 12 miles per hour / 60 minutes per hour = 0.2 miles per minute
Time = 48 miles / 0.2 miles per minute = 240 minutes
Response 5:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

Action: Answer("E") 

Explanation: 
We are given the speed of the cyclist as 12 miles per hour and the distance to be covered as 48 miles. We need to find the time taken in minutes. 

We can first convert the speed to miles per minute by dividing it by 60. 
12 miles per hour = 12/60 miles per minute = 0.2 miles per minute

Now we can use the formula:
time = distance / speed
time = 48 / 0.2
time = 240 minutes

Therefore, it will take 240 minutes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles.
Response 6:
To solve the problem, we can use the formula:
time = distance / speed

Substituting the given values, we get:
time = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour

Simplifying, we get:
time = 4 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:
time = 4 hours x 60 minutes per hour

Therefore:
time = 240 minutes

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Action: Answer("E") 

We can convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per minute by dividing by 60. 

12 miles/hour = 12/60 miles/minute = 0.2 miles/minute 

So, the time it takes to travel 48 miles is: 

time = distance / speed = 48 miles / 0.2 miles/minute = 240 minutes
Response 8:
To solve the problem, we can use the formula `time = distance / speed`. Converting 12 miles per hour to miles per minute, we get 0.2 miles per minute (12/60). So, the time it takes to travel 48 miles is:
48 miles / 0.2 miles per minute = 240 minutes

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

Action: Answer("E") 

Explanation: 
- First, we convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per minute by dividing by 60: 12 miles/hour = 12/60 miles/minute = 0.2 miles/minute.
- Then we can use the formula: time = distance / speed = 48 miles / 0.2 miles/minute = 240 minutes.

Response 6:
Let's first calculate the total investment by all three:
A invested for 12 months, so his investment is 12 x 40000 = 480000
B invested for 10 months (joined after 2 months), so his investment is 10 x 60000 = 600000
Let x be the number of months C invested for. Therefore, his investment is (x/12) x 120000 = 10000x.
The total investment is 480000 + 600000 + 10000x = 1080000 + 10000x.
As we know, C received Rs.150,000 as his share. Therefore, the ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150000/375000 = 2/5.
We can set up the following equation:
2/5 = 10000x/(1080000 + 10000x)
Solving for x, we get x = 24.
Therefore, C joined after 24 - 2 = 22 months.

Question: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 62
  C: 82
  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Let's start by using the formula for the sum of consecutive integers: Sum = (n/2)(first integer + last integer), where n is the number of integers being summed.
We know that the sum is 51 and the first integer is -50, so we can plug in those values and solve for n:
51 = (n/2)(-50 + last integer)
2.04 = n/2 + last integer/2
4.08 = n + last integer
Since we are looking for the number of integers being summed, we can make an educated guess that the last integer is positive. If the last integer were negative, then the sum would be even more negative, and we know that the sum is positive (51). So let's assume that the last integer is x (where x is positive).
We know that the first integer is -50 and the last integer is x, so the sum of k consecutive integers is:
-50 + (-49) + ... + (x-1) + x
We can simplify this to:
(-50 + x) + (-49 + (x-1)) + ... + (x-1) + x
We have a total of k integers being summed, so we can divide the sum by k to get the average:
(-50 + x) + (-49 + (x-1)) + ... + (x-1) + x = k(x-k/2)
Average = k(x-k/2)/k = x-k/2
We know that the sum is 51, so the average is 51/k. We can set these two expressions for the average equal to each other and solve for k:
x-k/2 = 51/k
xk - k^2/2 = 51
k^2 - 2xk + 102 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
k = (2x ± sqrt(4x^2 - 408))/2
k = x ± sqrt(x^2 - 102)
Since we know that x is positive, we can eliminate the negative root. We also know that k is an integer, so we need to find a value of x that gives us an integer value for k. Let's try some values:
If x = 7, then k = 8. This doesn't work because the sum of 7 + 8 consecutive integers is greater than 51.
If x = 6, then k = 12. This works because the sum of -50 through -39 is 51.
Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d), where S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. Since we are given the sum of the series and the first term, we need to find the common difference and the number of terms. 

The sum of k consecutive integers is 51, so we have: 

S = 51 

The first term is -50, so we have: 

a = -50 

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series can be rewritten as: 

S = (n/2)(a + l), where l is the last term of the series. 

Since we are dealing with consecutive integers, the last term is a + (n-1)d. 

Therefore: 

S = (n/2)(a + a + (n-1)d) 

51 = (k/2)(-50 + (-50 + (k-1))) 

51 = (k/2)(k - 100) 

102 = k(k - 100) 

k^2 - 100k - 102 = 0 

Using the quadratic formula, we get: 

k = (100 ± sqrt(100^2 + 4(102)))/2 

k = (100 ± sqrt(10404))/2 

k = (100 ± 102)/2 

k = 51 or k = -1 

Since we are dealing with a sequence of positive integers, we can eliminate the negative solution. Therefore, k = 51. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's use the formula for the sum of consecutive integers: (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. 

In this case, we have:
- the sum is 51
- the first term is -50
- we don't know the number of terms or the common difference

Let's use algebra to solve for k:
(n/2)(2a + (n-1)d) = 51
(n/2)(2(-50) + (n-1)d) = 51
n(-100 + nd - d)/2 = 51
-100n/2 + (n^2 - n)d/2 = 51
-50n + (n^2 - n)d = 102

We know that the consecutive integers start at -50, so the sum will be positive if k is also positive. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B.

Let's try choice C:
-50(82) + (82^2 - 82)d = 102
-4100 + 6724d = 102
6724d = 4202
d = 0.625

This doesn't work because d should be a whole number for consecutive integers. Therefore, we can eliminate choice C.

Let's try choice D:
-50(92) + (92^2 - 92)d = 102
-4600 + 7744d = 102
7744d = 4702
d = 0.607

This also doesn't work because d should be a whole number. Therefore, we can eliminate choice D.

Let's try choice E:
-50(102) + (102^2 - 102)d = 102
-5100 + 10404d = 102
10404d = 5202
d = 0.5

This works because d is a whole number, which means we have k consecutive integers. Therefore, the answer is k = 102. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let's use the formula for the sum of consecutive integers:
sum = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d)
where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference between terms.

We know the sum is 51, the first term is -50, and we are looking for the number of terms k. We can also see that the common difference between terms is 1 (since the integers are consecutive).

Plugging in the values we know:
51 = (k/2)(2(-50) + (k-1)(1))

Simplifying:
51 = (k/2)(-99 + k)
102 = k(-99 + k)
k^2 - 99k + 102 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:
k = (99 ± sqrt(99^2 - 4(1)(102))) / 2
k = (99 ± sqrt(9405)) / 2
k ≈ 2.52 or k ≈ 96.48

Since we are looking for a whole number of terms, the answer is k = 96, which is closest to answer choice:

Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
Response 0:
Let's assume the original square piece of cloth had a side of length x. When we trim 4 feet from one edge, we get a rectangle with dimensions x-4 and x. When we cut this rectangle diagonally, we get two right triangles with legs x-4 and x/2. 

The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. We know that the area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height. So, we can set up the equation:

(1/2) * (x-4) * (x/2) = 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

(x-4) * (x/2) = 140
x^2 - 4x - 280 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation, we get x = 20 or x = -14. We can ignore the negative solution, so the original square piece of cloth had a side length of 20 feet.

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x = 80 feet.

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("D") 62.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let the original side of the square piece of cloth be x. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) by x. The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. 

When the rectangular piece is cut diagonally, it forms two right triangles. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. The area of a right triangle is given by (1/2) base x height. Therefore, we have:

(1/2)(x-4)h = 70, where h is the height of the right triangle.

Solving for h, we get:
h = 140/(x-4)

Now, using the Pythagorean theorem, we can express the length of the diagonal of the rectangular piece in terms of x and h:
(x-4)^2 + h^2 = x^2

Substituting the expression for h, we get:
(x-4)^2 + (140/(x-4))^2 = x^2

Expanding and simplifying, we get a quadratic equation:
x^2 - 8x - 336 = 0

Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get:
x = 14 or x = -24 (discarding the negative solution)

Therefore, the original side of the square piece of cloth was 14 feet. The perimeter of the original piece of cloth was 4x = 56 feet.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let's assume that the original square cloth had a side of length x feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) feet and x feet. The area of the rectangular piece is the product of its dimensions, which is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x square feet. 

When the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, two identical right triangles are formed. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. The area of a right triangle can be calculated as (1/2) * base * height. In this case, the base and height of each triangle are the two sides of the rectangle, which are x and (x-4). So, we can write:

(1/2) * x * (x-4) = 70
x^2 - 4x - 280 = 0

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

x = [4 +/- sqrt(4^2 - 4(1)(-280))] / (2*1)
x = [4 +/- sqrt(1136)] / 2
x = 2 +/- sqrt(284)

Since x represents the length of a side of the original square cloth, it must be positive. Therefore, we can ignore the negative solution and take:

x = 2 + sqrt(284) ≈ 18.83 feet

The perimeter of the original square cloth is 4x feet, which is approximately 75.31 feet. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Let's assume the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular piece, which is also the hypotenuse of the two triangles:
diagonal^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2
diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet, so the area of both triangles is 140 square feet:
70 + 70 = (1/2) * diagonal * (x-4)
140 = (1/2) * diagonal * (x-4)
280 = diagonal * (x-4)
We can substitute diagonal^2 from the first equation into the second equation:
140 = (1/2) * sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16) * (x-4)
280 = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16) * (x-4)
Squaring both sides:
78400 = (2x^2 - 8x + 16) * (x-4)^2
78400 = 2(x-4)^2(x-2)
39200 = (x-4)^2(x-2)
Taking the square root of both sides:
x-4 = sqrt(39200/(x-2))
x = 4 + sqrt(39200/(x-2))
We can now substitute x into one of the original equations to find the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth:
Perimeter = 4x = 4(4 + sqrt(39200/(x-2)))
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's assume that the side of the original square piece of cloth is x feet. 

When one edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. 

The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x square feet. 

When the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, it forms two right triangles. Each triangle has the rectangular piece's shorter side (x-4) as its base and the square piece's side (x) as its hypotenuse. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. 

We can use the area of a right triangle formula to find the height of each triangle: 

(1/2) * base * height = area 

(1/2) * (x-4) * height = 70 

height = 140 / (x-4) 

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can also write: 

(x-4)^2 + height^2 = x^2 

Substituting the value of height, we get: 

(x-4)^2 + (140 / (x-4))^2 = x^2 

Simplifying this equation gives us a quadratic equation: 

x^2 - 12x + 44 + 19600 / (x-4)^2 = 0 

Multiplying both sides by (x-4)^2 and simplifying gives us: 

x^4 - 20x^3 + 116x^2 - 192x + 9604 = 0 

This equation can be factored as: 

(x-10)(x-6)(x^2-4x+160) = 0 

The solutions are x = 10, x = 6, and the roots of x^2-4x+160 = 0, which are complex. 

Since x represents the side of the original square piece of cloth, we choose x = 10. 

Therefore, the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x = 40 feet. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let the side of the original square piece of cloth be x. After trimming 4 feet, the rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x. The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. 

Cutting the rectangular piece diagonally creates two right triangles, each with legs x-4 and x, and area 70 square feet. 

The area of a right triangle is (1/2)base*height, so we can set up the equation (1/2)(x-4)x = 70 and solve for x:

(1/2)(x^2 - 4x) = 70
x^2 - 4x = 140
x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0
(x-14)(x+10) = 0

Since x represents a length, we take the positive solution x=14. Therefore, the original piece of cloth had side length 14 feet. 

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x = 4(14) = 56 feet.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let the original side of the square be x. Then, after trimming, the rectangular piece has sides of x-4 and x. The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. When this rectangle is cut in half, we get two congruent triangles with base x-4 and height h (where h is the height of the original square). The area of each triangle is (1/2)(x-4)h = 70. Solving for h, we get h = 140/(x-4). 

Since the original shape was a square, we know that x = h. Substituting in the expression for h that we just found, we get x = 140/(x-4). Solving for x, we get x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0, which factors as (x-14)(x+10) = 0. Since x represents a length, we take x = 14 (the positive root). 

Therefore, the original square had side length 14 feet, and its perimeter was 4*14 = 56 feet. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let's assume the original side of the square is "x". 

When we trim 4 feet on one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangle are (x-4) by x. 

When we cut the rectangle diagonally, we get two triangles, each with base (x-4) and height x. 

The area of each triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70. 

Solving for x, we get x = 14. 

Therefore, the original perimeter of the square cloth was 4x = 56 feet.

Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:
  A: 46
  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
Let's denote the length of the painted side as l and the width as w. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so the perimeter of the rectangle is:

P = l + w + l + 9 = 2l + w + 9

We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so:

2l + w = 37 - 9 = 28

Substituting this into the equation for the perimeter, we get:

P = 2l + w + 9 = 28 + 9 = 37

We can solve for w in the equation 2l + w = 28 to get:

w = 28 - 2l

The area of the rectangle is:

A = lw

Substituting w = 28 - 2l, we get:

A = l(28 - 2l) = 28l - 2l^2

To maximize the area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to l and set it equal to 0:

dA/dl = 28 - 4l = 0

Solving for l, we get:

l = 7

Substituting this back into the equation for w, we get:

w = 28 - 2(7) = 14

So the area of the rectangle is:

A = lw = (7)(14) = 98

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("A") 46.
Response 1:
Let's denote the width of the parking space as w. Since the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, the length of the parking space is 9 + w. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we can write the equation:

2w + 9 + (9 + w) = 37

Simplifying and solving for w, we get:

3w = 19

w = 6.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the length of the parking space is 9 + w = 15.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

The area of the parking space is length times width, so:

Area = 15.33 x 6.33 = 97.03 (rounded to two decimal places)

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let's denote the width of the rectangle by w. Then the length of the rectangle is 9 + 2w. We know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we can write the equation:

length of one painted side + length of the other painted side + length of unpainted side = 37

2w + 9 + 2w = 37

4w = 28

w = 7

So the width of the rectangle is 7 feet, and the length is 9 + 2(7) = 23 feet. Therefore, the area of the parking space is:

Area = length x width = 23 x 7 = 161 square feet

Answer: Answer("E") None of the above (The correct answer is not among the choices given. The area of the parking space is 161 square feet.)
Response 3:
We can start by using the information given to find the length and width of the rectangular parking space. Let's call the length L and the width W. We know that the unpainted side has a length of 9, so either L or W is 9. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37, which means:

2L + W = 37 - 9 = 28

Now we have two equations:

L + W = 28/2 = 14
L or W = 9

We can solve for L and W by substituting L = 9 into the first equation:

9 + W = 14
W = 5

So the dimensions of the parking space are 9 feet by 5 feet. The area is:

A = L * W = 9 * 5 = 45 square feet

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
We can begin by using the given information to write two equations. Let L be the length of the parking space and W be the width. Then we have:

W = 9 feet (since the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet)
2L + W = 37 feet (since the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet)

We can solve for L in the second equation:

2L + W = 37
2L + 9 = 37
2L = 28
L = 14 feet

Now we can find the area of the parking space:

Area = L x W
Area = 14 feet x 9 feet
Area = 126 square feet

Therefore, the answer is (C) 126. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the length of the painted side of the rectangle is L and the width is W. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. 
According to the problem, the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. This means that:
2L + W = 37 - 9
2L + W = 28
We also know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = L x W. We can solve for W in terms of L using the equation above:
W = 28 - 2L
Substituting this into the formula for the area, we get:
A = L x (28 - 2L)
A = 28L - 2L^2
To find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to L and set it equal to zero:
dA/dL = 28 - 4L
28 - 4L = 0
L = 7
Substituting this value of L back into the equation for the area, we get:
A = 28(7) - 2(7)^2
A = 196 - 98
A = 98
Therefore, the area of the parking space is 98 square feet.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Let the width of the parking space be "w". 
Then the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 2w + L, where L is the length of the parking space. 
We know that L + 2w = 37 and w = 9. 
Substituting w = 9 in L + 2w = 37, we get L = 19. 
Therefore, the area of the parking space is Lw = 19 x 9 = 171 square feet. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We can start by using the given information to set up two equations. Let L be the length of the parking space and W be the width of the parking space. Then we have:

- 2L + W = 37 (the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37)
- L + 2W = 9 (the length of the unpainted side is 9)

Solving for L in the second equation, we get L = 9 - 2W. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

2(9 - 2W) + W = 37
18 - 4W + W = 37
18 - 3W = 37
-3W = 19
W = -19/3

This is not a valid solution, since the width of the parking space cannot be negative. Therefore, none of the given choices is correct.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
We know that the parking space has three painted sides and one unpainted side. Let's call the length of the unpainted side "l" and the width "w". We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Since there are two widths and one length, we can write an equation:

2w + l = 37

We also know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so we can write another equation:

l = 9

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for "w":

2w + 9 = 37
2w = 28
w = 14

Now that we know the width is 14 feet, we can use the equation for the area of a rectangle to find the area:

A = lw
A = 9 x 14
A = 126

Solution:

Let's assume the length of the yard is x feet. 

We know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 

Area = length x width 

So we can set up the equation: 

3000 = x * 100 

Simplifying the equation: 

x = 30 

Therefore, the length of the yard is 30 feet. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
We can start by using the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = length x width. We know that one side is 100 feet wide, so we can substitute that into the formula: 3000 = length x 100. To solve for length, we can divide both sides by 100: length = 3000/100. Simplifying, we get length = 30.

Given that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide, we can write: 

Area = 100 x x = 100x 

We also know that the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. Therefore: 

100x = 3,000 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 30 

Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

Question: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 15
  C: 12
  D: 6
  E: 3
Response 0:
Let's assume that Hose A can fill the pool in x hours working alone. Therefore, we know that:
- In 1 hour, Hose A can fill 1/x of the pool.
- In 2 hours, Hose A can fill 2/x of the pool.
- In 3 hours, Hose A and Hose B working together can fill 3(1/x + 1/y) = 1 pool, where y is the number of hours it would take Hose B to fill the pool alone.

We can simplify the third equation to get:
3/x + 3/y = 1

We can also simplify the first two equations to get:
2/x = 1/4
=> x = 8

Now we can substitute x = 8 into the third equation and solve for y:
3/8 + 3/y = 1
=> 3/y = 5/8
=> y = 24/5

Therefore, Hose B can fill the pool alone in 24/5 hours, which is approximately 4.8 hours.

Question: Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is?
Choices:
  A: 21
  B: 33
  C: 35
  D: 42
  E: 58
Response 0:
Let's assume the two numbers in the ratio 3:5 are 3x and 5x. 

We know that if 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. So, (3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12/23. 

Cross-multiplying, we get: 23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9) 

Simplifying, we get: 69x - 207 = 60x - 108 

Solving for x, we get: x = 99/3 = 33 

So, the two numbers in the ratio 3:5 are 3x = 3(33) = 99 and 5x = 5(33) = 165. 

Therefore, the smaller number is 3x - 9 = 99 - 9 = 90. 

Action: Answer("None of the above") 

Note: None of the given choices is equal to the smaller number, which is 90.
Response 1:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9. We are told that (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Cross-multiplying gives 69x - 207 = 60x - 108, which gives x = 99/3 = 33. Therefore, the smaller number is 3x = 3*33 = 99. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let the numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, the new ratio becomes 12:23. So, we can write:

(3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23

Cross multiplying, we get:

69x - 207 = 60x - 108

Solving for x, we get:

x = 33

So, the smaller number is 3x = 99.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. Then, we can form the following equations:
(3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23
Solving for x, we get x = 23.
Therefore, the smaller number is 3x - 9 = 3(23) - 9 = 60.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9. The problem states that (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Cross-multiplying and simplifying gives 69x = 207, so x = 3. Therefore, the smaller number is 3x-9 = 6. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9. According to the problem, (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get 69x = 207, which means x = 3. Therefore, the smaller number is 3x-9 = 6. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Let the original numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, we have (3x-9) and (5x-9). According to the problem, (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Cross-multiplying, we get 69x = 207, which implies x = 3. Therefore, the smaller number is 3x - 9 = 3(3) - 9 = 0. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Let the numbers be 3x and 5x. Then the numbers after subtracting 9 are 3x-9 and 5x-9. We are given that (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Solving for x, we get x=69/8. Therefore, the smaller number is 3x = 207/8.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
To solve this problem, we can use the fact that if one of the roots of a quadratic equation is known, then the other root can be found using the quadratic formula. 

The quadratic formula states that for a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the roots are given by:

x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, the quadratic equation is x^2 + mx + 22 = 0, and we know that one of the roots is 1.5. Let's call the other root r. Then we can write:

x^2 + mx + 22 = (x - 1.5)(x - r)

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

x^2 - (1.5 + r)x + 1.5r = x^2 + mx + 22

Equating the coefficients of x on both sides, we get:

- (1.5 + r) = m    ...(1)

Equating the constant terms on both sides, we get:

1.5r = 22

Solving for r, we get:

r = 22/1.5 = 14.67

Substituting this value of r in equation (1), we get:

m = - (1.5 + 14.67) = -16.17

Therefore, the value of m is approximately -16.17, which is closest to choice D: -16.2.

  C: 12
  D: 13
  E: 14
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
First, we can find the GCD of 2272 and 875 by using the Euclidean algorithm:

2272 = 2 * 875 + 522
875 = 1 * 522 + 353
522 = 1 * 353 + 169
353 = 2 * 169 + 15
169 = 11 * 15 + 4
15 = 3 * 4 + 3
4 = 1 * 3 + 1

The last non-zero remainder is 1, so GCD(2272, 875) = 1.

Since the remainder is the same when 2272 and 875 are divided by N, we know that N must divide the difference between them:

N divides 2272 - 875 = 1397.

The only 3-digit factors of 1397 are 17 and 82. We can check that neither of these works for both divisions, so there is no solution.

Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above". However, the most likely answer is A: 10, since the sum of the digits of a 3-digit number is usually less than or equal to 9 + 9 + 9 = 27.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
First, we need to find the HCF of (2272-N) and (875-N) to find out the remainder when divided by N. 

2272-N = N x Q1 + R
875-N = N x Q2 + R

where Q1 and Q2 are the quotients and R is the remainder. 

Subtracting the above two equations, we get:

1397 = N x (Q1 - Q2)

As N is a 3-digit number, the maximum value of N can be 139. 

Now, we need to check each option and find the sum of the digits of the possible values of N. 

For option A: If N = 139, sum of digits = 1+3+9 = 13
For option B: If N = 128, sum of digits = 1+2+8 = 11
For option C: If N = 117, sum of digits = 1+1+7 = 9
For option D: If N = 106, sum of digits = 1+0+6 = 7
For option E: If N = 95, sum of digits = 9+5 = 14

Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
First, we need to find the HCF of (2272-N) and (875-N) to get the number that divides both the numbers leaving the same remainder. 

2272 - N = (N-875) x Q1 + R
=> 2N = (2272-875) + R
=> N = 1198 + R/2

875 - N = (N-875) x Q2 + R
=> 2N = 875 + R
=> N = 875/2 + R/2

Since N is a 3-digit number, R/2 can only be a single-digit number from 0 to 9. 
So, 1198 + R/2 = 875/2 + R/2
=> 323 = 3R/2
=> R = 2 x 107/3 = 71

Now, we have N = 1198 + 71/2 = 1233/2

Sum of the digits of N = 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 10

Question: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 8
  C: 22
  D: 50
  E: 20
Response 0:
Let's denote the total time taken to clean the yacht as `T`. We know that Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, so the remaining one-third of the work must be done by Jill. 

Let's first calculate how much of the yacht Jack can clean in one day:
Jack's rate of cleaning = 1/12 of the yacht per hour
Jack's time spent cleaning = 1 day = 24 hours
Jack's work done in one day = Jack's rate of cleaning * Jack's time spent cleaning = (1/12) * 24 = 2

So Jack can clean 2/3 of the yacht in 2/3 of a day, which is 16 hours. This means that the remaining one-third of the yacht must be cleaned in 8 hours (24 - 16 = 8).

Now we need to find out how long it takes Jill to clean one-third of the yacht. We know that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, so her rate of cleaning is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour. Let's denote the time it takes Jill to clean one-third of the yacht as `t`. 

Jill's work done in `t` hours = Jill's rate of cleaning * `t` * (1/3)
We want Jill's work done in `t` hours to be equal to one-third of the yacht:
Jill's rate of cleaning * `t` * (1/3) = 1/3

Simplifying this equation, we get:
`t` = 240

Therefore, it takes Jill 240 hours to clean one-third of the yacht. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable 'W'. 

Since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the work per hour. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. Hence, the remaining portion of the work is (1 - 2/3) = 1/3 of the work. 

Let's assume that it takes Jill 'x' hours to finish the remaining 1/3 of the work. 

Since Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, her rate of cleaning is 5/100 * (1/12) = 1/240 of the work per hour. 

Now we can use the formula: 
rate * time = work 

Jack's rate * (2/3) + Jill's rate * (x) = (1/3) 

Substituting the values, we get: 

(1/12) * (2/3) + (1/240) * (x) = (1/3) 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

x = 20 

Therefore, it takes Jill 20 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the total work is 1 (a cleaned yacht). Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12. On the particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he finished (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 of the work. Therefore, the remaining work is (1 - 2/3) = 1/3.

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means her rate of cleaning is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240. Let's assume that Jill takes x hours to finish the remaining work. Therefore, her rate of cleaning is 1/x.

We know that the combined rate of cleaning of Jack and Jill is equal to the rate of cleaning of the whole job, which is 1/12. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows:

(2/3) * (1/12) + (1/3) * (1/x) = 1/12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

1/18 + 1/3x = 1/12

Multiplying both sides by 36x, we get:

2x + 12 = 3x

x = 12

Therefore, it takes Jill 12 hours to finish the remaining work.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's first calculate the fraction of work Jack completed: 
Fraction of work completed by Jack = 2/3
Fraction of work remaining = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3

Let's now calculate Jill's rate of cleaning: 
Jill's rate = 5% of Jack's rate = 5/100 * (1/12) = 1/240

Let's now use the formula: 
time = work / rate

Time taken by Jill to complete the remaining work = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80
Therefore, the answer is 80/60 = 4

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's first calculate the fraction of work Jack completed: 2/3. Therefore, the remaining fraction of work is 1/3.
Let's also convert Jack's rate of work to a fraction of work per hour. If he can complete the job in 12 hours, he can complete 1/12 of the job in one hour. 
Jill's rate of work is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, Jill's rate is 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 of the job per hour. 
To find how long it takes Jill to complete the remaining 1/3 of the job, we can use the formula: time = work/rate. 
The remaining work is 1/3, and Jill's rate is 1/240. Therefore, time = (1/3)/(1/240) = 80. 
So, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's denote the total time Jill takes to clean the remaining portion of the yacht as "t".
We know that Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours. So, the portion of work he can do in 1 hour is 1/12.
On a particular day, Jack finished two-thirds of the work. So, the remaining one-third of the work is left for Jill.
Let's denote the total work as "W". So, the remaining work is (1/3)W.
The portion of work Jill can do in 1 hour is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240.
We can use the formula: Work = Rate * Time to solve this problem.
So, (1/3)W = (1/12) * (2/3) * t + (1/240) * t
Simplifying this equation, we get:
(1/3)W = (1/8) * t
t = (8/3) * W
We know that it takes Jack 12 hours to clean the yacht by himself. So, the total work is done in 12 hours.
So, W = 1 and t = (8/3)
Therefore, Jill takes (8/3) hours to finish the remaining work.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let's assume that the total work is represented by the variable "W". 

Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours. Therefore, his rate of cleaning is W/12.

On a particular day, Jack cleaned two-thirds of the yacht. Therefore, the remaining one-third of the work is represented by W/3.

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, her rate of cleaning is 0.05*(W/12) = W/240.

Let's assume that Jill takes "x" hours to finish the remaining work. Therefore, her rate of cleaning is W/3x.

We know that Jack cleaned two-thirds of the yacht, and Jill cleaned the remaining one-third of the yacht. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

(W/3) = (W/12)*(2/3) + (W/3x)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 20

Therefore, Jill takes 20 hours to finish the remaining work.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let's call the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work "t". 

We know that Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so in one hour he can clean 1/12 of the yacht. 

On the particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, so there is one-third of the work left for Jill to do. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, so in one hour she can clean 0.05/12 of the yacht. 

We can use the formula: 

rate * time = work 

For Jack, we have: 

(1/12) * (2/3) = 1/18 

For Jill, we have: 

(0.05/12) * t = (1/3) 

Simplifying the second equation: 

t = (1/3) / (0.05/12) 

t = 80 

So it will take Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's call the total time it takes Jack to clean the yacht "T". 

We know that Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so T = 12. 

On this particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he has one-third of the work left to do. 

Let's call the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining one-third of the work "t". 

We know that Jack's rate of cleaning is such that he can clean the entire yacht in T = 12 hours. Therefore, his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. 

We also know that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, her rate of cleaning is 0.05/12 of the yacht per hour. 

Since Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, that means he cleaned one-third of the yacht. Therefore, the remaining one-third of the yacht will take: 

(1/3) / (0.05/12) = 80 hours 

So it will take Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let's first calculate how much time Jack took to complete two-thirds of the work. 

Two-thirds of the work = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3
Let's assume the total time taken to complete the work is x hours. 

In one hour, Jack can do 1/12th of the work. 
So, in x hours, Jack can do x/12th of the work. 

As Jack completed two-thirds of the work, the remaining one-third of the work will be done by Jill. 

Let's calculate Jill's rate of cleaning. 
Jill's rate of cleaning = 5% of Jack's rate of cleaning 
Jill's rate of cleaning = 5/100 * (1/12) = 1/240

As the remaining one-third of the work is done by Jill, 
(1/3) = [(1/240) * t] 
where t is the time taken by Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work. 

Solving for t, we get t = 8. 

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("B") 8.

Response 3:

Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the hundreds digit is x, the tens digit is y, and the units digit is z. 

We know that:
x + y + z = 17  (Equation 1)
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109 (Equation 2)

From Equation 1, we can rewrite it as:
x = 17 - y - z

Substituting this into Equation 2, we get:
(17 - y - z)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109

Simplifying this equation, we get:
2y^2 + 2z^2 - 34y - 34z + 120 = 0

Dividing by 2, we get:
y^2 + z^2 - 17y - 17z + 60 = 0

We can factor this equation as:
(y - 4)(y - 9) + (z - 4)(z - 9) = 0

Since y and z are digits, the only possible solutions are:
(y - 4) = 0 and (z - 9) = 0, which means y = 4 and z = 9
OR
(y - 9) = 0 and (z - 4) = 0, which means y = 9 and z = 4

If y = 4 and z = 9, then x = 4 from Equation 1, and the original number is 419. Subtracting 495 from this gives us 419 - 495 = -76, which does not have the same digits written in reverse order.

If y = 9 and z = 4, then x = 4 from Equation 1, and the original number is 494. Subtracting 495 from this gives us 494 - 495 = -1, which also does not have the same digits written in reverse order.

Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.

Answer: None of the above.
Response 6:
We can solve this problem by using algebra. Let's call the hundreds digit "x", the tens digit "y", and the units digit "z". Then, we can write two equations based on the given information:

Equation 1: x + y + z = 17
Equation 2: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109

We also know that when we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number with the same digits in reverse order. This means that:

(100x + 10y + z) - 495 = 100z + 10y + x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

99x - 99z = 495
x - z = 5

Now we can use this third equation to eliminate one variable from the first two equations. Solving for one variable in terms of the other, we get:

x = 5 + z

Substituting this into Equation 1, we get:

(5 + z) + y + z = 17
2z + y = 12

Squaring Equation 1 and substituting in Equation 2, we get:

(17 - z)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

z^2 - 34z + 120 = 0

Factoring this quadratic equation, we get:

(z - 10)(z - 12) = 0

This gives us two possible values for z: z = 10 or z = 12.

If z = 10, then from Equation 1 we have:

x + y = 7

Substituting x = 5 + z = 15 and solving for y, we get:

y = -8

This is not a valid digit, so z cannot be 10.

If z = 12, then from Equation 1 we have:

x + y = 5

Substituting x = 5 + z = 17 and solving for y, we get:

y = -12

This is not a valid digit, so z cannot be 12 either.

Therefore, there is no three-digit number that satisfies all the given conditions. None of the above (NOTA) is the best answer.

Question: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 30
  C: 45
  D: 60
  E: 75
Response 0:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on the rest of the days of the week. 

On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many papers as the rest of the week, so it buys 2x newspapers. 

The hotel pays $4 for each Sunday newspaper and $1 for each newspaper on the rest of the days of the week. In one week, the hotel pays $210 for newspapers. 

We can set up an equation to solve for x: 

$4(2x) + $1(x * 6) = $210 

Simplifying the equation: 

$8x + $6x = $210 

$14x = $210 

x = 15 

Therefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Firstly, let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. 

Then, the number of newspapers it buys on Sunday is 2x. 

The total cost of newspapers per week is $210, so we can write an equation: 

2x($4) + 5x($1) = $210 

Simplifying, we get: 

8x + 5x = $210 

13x = $210 

x ≈ 16.15 

Since x represents the number of newspapers bought on Monday, we can round it to the nearest whole number and get: 

Action: Answer("16")
Response 3:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Then, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday.
Thus, the total number of newspapers bought in a week is 2x + x + x + x + x + x + x = 7x.
The total cost of buying these newspapers is 4(2x) + 1(5x) = 13x.
We know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. Therefore, we can write:
13x = 210
Solving for x, we get:
x = 210/13 ≈ 16.15
Since the hotel buys whole numbers of newspapers, it buys 16 newspapers on Monday.
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let the number of newspapers bought on Sunday be x, then the number of newspapers bought on each of the other days of the week is (1/2)x. 

The cost of buying x newspapers on Sunday is 4x. The cost of buying (1/2)x newspapers on each of the other days of the week is (1/2)x * 1 * 6 = 3x.

The total cost of buying newspapers for the week is 4x + 3x = 7x. We know that the hotel pays $210 per week, so 7x = 210, and x = 30.

Therefore, the hotel buys 30 newspapers on Sunday and (1/2)x = 15 newspapers on Monday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Then, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. Therefore, the hotel buys (1 * x) + (2 * 4) = x + 8 newspapers on Sunday. It buys x newspapers on each of the other 5 days of the week.  
To find the value of x, we can create an equation:  
x + 8 + 5x = 210 / 7  
Simplifying the equation, we get:  
6x + 8 = 30  
6x = 22  
x ≈ 3.67  
Therefore, the hotel buys approximately 4 newspapers on Monday.  

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Sunday be s, and the number of newspapers it buys on Monday be m. 

From the problem, we know that:
- The hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does the rest of the week, so s = 2m.
- The hotel pays $4 per newspaper on Sunday, and $1 per newspaper the rest of the week, so the total cost per week is 4s + 1(7m) = 210.

Substituting s = 2m into the second equation, we get:
4(2m) + 7m = 210
Simplifying:
15m = 210
m = 14

Therefore, the hotel buys 14 newspapers on Monday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's start by setting up equations based on the given information:
Let x be the number of newspapers bought on Monday
The hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does for the rest of the days of the week, so it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday.
The total cost of the newspapers per week is $210, so we can set up the equation:
4(2x) + 1(5x) = 210
Simplifying the equation, we get:
8x + 5x = 210
13x = 210
x = 16.15 (rounded to the nearest hundredth)
Since the hotel cannot buy a fraction of a newspaper, we can round x up to the nearest whole number, which is 17.
Therefore, the hotel buys 17 newspapers on Monday.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let the number of newspapers bought on Sunday be x and the number of newspapers bought on the rest of the days be y. 

From the given information, we know:
- x = 2y (twice as many newspapers on Sunday)
- 4x + 1(7y) = 210 (total cost of newspapers per week)

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
- 4x + 7y = 210
- 4(2y) + 7y = 210 (substituting x = 2y)
- 15y = 210
- y = 14

So, the hotel buys 14 newspapers on each day from Monday to Saturday, and 2y newspapers on Sunday:
- Total newspapers bought per week = 14(6) + 2y = 84 + 2y
- Total cost per week = 4y + 1(14)(6) = 24 + 4y

Since the hotel pays $210 per week, we can set up an equation:
- 24 + 4y = 210
- 4y = 186
- y = 46.5

This is not a whole number, which means our calculations must be incorrect. Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.

Question: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
Choices:
  A: 144km
  B: 72 km
  C: 126km
  D: 84 km
  E: 48km
Response 0:
Let the distance between X and Y be d.
Let the time taken for Bob to reach Y be t.
Then, the time taken for Allen to reach Y is also t.
When they meet for the first time, the total distance covered by both of them is d.
When they meet for the second time, the total distance covered by both of them is 3d.
Distance covered by Allen in the first part of the journey = 54t
Distance covered by Bob in the first part of the journey = 78t
Therefore, distance covered by Bob in the second part of the journey = 78t - 48 (as Bob covers 48 km more than Allen)
Distance covered by Allen in the second part of the journey = 54t + 48 (as Allen starts from Y and covers a distance of 48 km before meeting Bob)
Total distance covered in the second part of the journey = (78t - 48) + (54t + 48) = 132t
Total distance covered in the entire journey = d + d = 2d
Therefore, 2d = 132t
d = 66t
Substituting this value of d in the equation 78t - 48 = 54t + 48, we get t = 2.4 hours
Therefore, d = 66t = 158.4 km
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") (The correct answer is not among the choices given)
Response 1:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken by both Allen and Bob to meet for the second time be t hours. 

When they meet for the first time, the distance covered by Allen is d/2 km and the distance covered by Bob is also d/2 km. 

Therefore, the time taken by Allen to reach Y is (d/2)/54 = d/108 hours. Similarly, the time taken by Bob to reach X is (d/2)/78 = d/156 hours. 

When they meet for the second time, the distance covered by Allen is d km and the distance covered by Bob is 2d - 48 km (since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen). 

Therefore, (d/108) + (d/156) = (2d - 48)/78. Solving for d, we get d = 126 km. 

Answer: Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let the distance between X and Y be d.
Let the time taken for them to meet for the first time be t.
Then, distance covered by Allen in time t = 54t
Distance covered by Bob in time t = 78t
Since they meet at some point in between X and Y, the total distance covered by both of them is d.
So, distance covered by Allen in returning from Y to X = 54t
Distance covered by Bob in returning from X to Y = 78t
Total distance covered by Bob = 78t + 78t - 48 = 156t - 48
Total distance covered by Allen = 54t + 54t = 108t
Since they both covered the same distance, 108t = 156t - 48
48 = 48t
t = 1 hour
Therefore, distance between X and Y = d = distance covered by Allen in 2 hours = 54 * 2 = 108 km
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken by both to meet for the first time be t hours. 
Then, distance covered by Allen in t hours = 54t km
Distance covered by Bob in t hours = 78t km
When they meet for the first time, their total distance covered is d km. 
Therefore, 54t + 78t = d  ----(1)
Also, we know that they meet for the second time after Allen returns to X and Bob returns to Y. 
When they meet for the second time, Allen covers a total distance of 2d km and Bob covers a total distance of 2d + 48 km (given in the question). 
Using the formula, distance = speed x time, we can find the time taken by Allen and Bob to meet for the second time. 
Time taken by Allen to meet for the second time = 2d/54 hours
Time taken by Bob to meet for the second time = (2d + 48)/78 hours
Since they both meet at the same time, we can equate their time taken and solve for d. 
2d/54 = (2d + 48)/78
On solving, d = 126 km

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C") 126km
Response 4:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken by both Allen and Bob to meet at the first time be t hours. 

At the first meeting, the distance travelled by Allen = 54t km and the distance travelled by Bob = 78t km. 

When they meet for the second time, Allen would have travelled a total of 2d km (i.e., d km towards Y and then d km back towards X) and Bob would have travelled a total of 2d+48 km (i.e., (d+48) km towards X and then (d+48) km back towards Y). 

Since they both meet at the same time, we can write: 

2d/54 = (2d+48)/78 - t 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

d = 126 km 

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 126 km. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km.
Let the time taken for Allen to reach Y be t hours.
Then, the time taken for Bob to reach X is also t hours (since they started at the same time and meet for the first time at Y).
Distance covered by Allen in t hours = 54t
Distance covered by Bob in t hours = 78t
Distance covered by Allen in returning from Y to X in (d-t) hours = 54(d-t)
Distance covered by Bob in returning from X to Y in (d-t) hours = 78(d-t)
Total distance covered by Bob = Distance covered by Allen + 48 km (given)
Therefore, 2(78t + 78(d-t)) = 2(54t + 54(d-t)) + 48
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
t = d/72
Substituting this value in the equation 2(78t + 78(d-t)) = 2(54t + 54(d-t)) + 48 and solving for d, we get:
d = 126 km
Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C") 126km.
Response 7:
Let's consider the distance between X and Y as d.
Let's assume they meet at a point P for the first time, after each of them has traveled a distance of x from their respective starting points.
At this point, the distance remaining for Allen to reach Y is (d-x) and the distance remaining for Bob to reach X is (d-x).
We know that Allen's speed is 54 kmph and Bob's speed is 78 kmph.
Let's calculate the time taken by Allen to reach P: time = distance/speed = x/54.
Similarly, the time taken by Bob to reach P is also x/78.
Since they started at the same time, the total time taken by them to reach P is the same. Therefore, we can write the equation x/54 = x/78.
Solving this equation, we get x = (9/13)d.
Now, the distance covered by Allen from P to Y is (d-x) = (4/13)d.
Similarly, the distance covered by Bob from P to X is also (4/13)d.
We know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen in this time. Therefore, we can write the equation 78*(4/13)d - 54*(4/13)d = 48.
Solving this equation, we get d = 144.
Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 144 km.
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let the distance between X and Y be d. 
Let t be the time taken for Allen and Bob to meet for the first time. 
At this time, Allen would have traveled a distance of 54t and Bob would have traveled a distance of 78t. 
The total distance between X and Y is d, so the distance between Y and the first meeting point is d - 54t for Allen and d - 78t for Bob. 
For the second meeting, Allen would have traveled a distance of 2(d - 54t) and Bob would have traveled a distance of 2(d - 78t) + 48. 
Since they meet at the same time, we can equate their distances: 
2(d - 54t) = 2(d - 78t) + 48 
Simplifying, we get: 
24t = d - 24 
Substituting this into the equation for the first meeting point, we get: 
d - 54t = d - 2d + 24 
Simplifying, we get: 
d = 144 km 

Therefore, the answer is A: 144km
Response 9:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. 
Let the time taken by Allen to reach Y be t hours. 
Therefore, the time taken by Bob to reach X is also t hours. 

Distance covered by Allen in t hours = 54t km
Distance covered by Bob in t hours = 78t km

When they meet for the first time, the sum of the distances covered by both of them is equal to d. 

54t + 78t = d    ----(1)

When Allen meets Bob for the second time, Allen covers a distance of d km and Bob covers (d+48) km. 

Therefore, the total distance covered by Allen = d + (d+48) = 2d + 48 km 
The total distance covered by Bob = (54t + 78t) + 48 = 132t + 48 km 

Since they cover the same distance, 

2d + 48 = 132t + 48 
2d = 132t 
d = 66t 

Substituting the value of d in equation (1), 

54t + 78t = 66t 
132t = 66t 
t = 0.5 hours 

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 

d = 66t = 66 x 0.5 = 33 km

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
Response 0:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is 'd' km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is 's' km/hr.

Given that, 

Speed = Distance/Time

=> s = d/6  (since the jeep took 6 hours in the forward journey)

During the return journey, the speed of the jeep increased by 12km/hr.

=> Speed = s + 12

=> s + 12 = d/4  (since the jeep took 4 hours in the return journey)

Substituting the value of 's' from the first equation in the second equation, we get:

(d/6) + 12 = d/4

Solving this equation, we get:

d = 144 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144km.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Solution:
Let's assume that the initial speed of the jeep was x km/hr.
Distance covered in the forward journey = x * 6
Distance covered in the return journey = (x + 12) * 4
As per the problem, both distances are equal.
Therefore, we can form the following equation:
x * 6 = (x + 12) * 4
Solving the above equation, we get x = 18 km/hr.
Therefore, distance travelled by the jeep = x * 6 = 18 * 6 = 108 km.

Action: Answer("None of the Above") [The answer should be 108km]
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep as "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey as "x" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

Speed = Distance/Time

Therefore, 

x = d/6   --- (Equation 1)

During the return journey, the speed of the jeep increased by 12km/hr. Therefore, the speed of the jeep during the return journey is (x+12) km/hr.

According to the problem, 

(x+12) = d/4   --- (Equation 2)

We need to find the value of "d".

Let's solve Equation 1 and 2 for "d".

From Equation 1, 

d = 6x

Substituting this value in Equation 2, we get

x+12 = (6x)/4

Simplifying this equation, we get

x = 24

Substituting this value in Equation 1, we get

d = 6x = 6*24 = 144 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let's first calculate the speed of the jeep during the forward journey.
Let the distance be 'd' km. Let the speed be 's' km/hr.
We know that time = distance/speed.
So, 6 = d/s
=> s = d/6

During the return journey, the speed of the jeep was increased by 12km/hr. So the speed was (d/6) + 12 km/hr.
Again, time = distance/speed.
So, 4 = d/(d/6 + 12)
=> 4 = 6/(1 + 2d/6)
=> 1 + 2d/6 = 6/4 = 3/2
=> 2d/6 = 1/2
=> d = 6 * (1/2) = 3

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 3 * 2 = 6 km.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") (None of the given choices is correct)
Response 5:
Solution:
Let's assume the initial speed of the jeep to be 'x' km/hr.
Let's also assume the distance travelled to be 'd' km.

According to the problem,
During the forward journey, 
time taken (t1) = 6 hours
speed (s1) = x km/hr
distance (d) = s1 * t1 = x * 6 = 6x km

During the return journey, 
time taken (t2) = 4 hours
speed (s2) = x + 12 km/hr (since the jeep increased its speed by 12km/hr)
distance (d) = s2 * t2 = (x + 12) * 4 = 4x + 48 km

As per the problem, the distance travelled by the jeep is the same during both the journeys. 
Therefore, 6x = 4x + 48
Solving for x, we get x = 24 km/hr

To find the distance travelled by the jeep, we can use any of the above equations.
Therefore, distance (d) = s1 * t1 = x * 6 = 24 * 6 = 144 km

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Solution: 

Let's assume that the jeep's speed during the forward journey is "x" km/hr. 

Distance = Speed x Time 

During the forward journey: 
Distance = x * 6 = 6x 

During the return journey: 
Speed = x + 12 km/hr (as it increased its speed by 12km/hr) 
Time = 4 hours 
Distance = (x + 12) * 4 = 4x + 48 

Total distance travelled = Distance during forward journey + Distance during return journey 
Total distance travelled = 6x + 4x + 48 
Total distance travelled = 10x + 48 

We need to find the value of "Total distance travelled". 

We can use the information provided in the question to form an equation: 

Total distance travelled = Distance during forward journey + Distance during return journey 
10x + 48 = 6x + 4x + 48 
10x - 6x - 4x = 48 - 48 
0 = 0 

The equation is true for any value of "x". This means that we cannot find the value of "x" or the total distance travelled with the information provided in the question. 

Answer: None of the above (the question does not provide enough information to solve for the distance)
Response 7:
Solution: Let the distance travelled by the jeep be "d" km. Let the speed of the jeep during the forward journey be "s" km/hr. Then, during the return journey, the speed of the jeep is (s+12) km/hr. We know that distance = speed x time. Using this formula, we can write two equations:
  d = s x 6   (since the jeep took 6 hours during the forward journey)
  d = (s+12) x 4   (since the jeep took 4 hours during the return journey)
We can solve these equations simultaneously to get the value of "d". First, we can simplify the second equation:
  d = (s+12) x 4
  d = 4s + 48
Now we can substitute the value of "d" from the first equation into this simplified equation:
  6s = 4s + 48
  2s = 48
  s = 24
Finally, we can substitute the value of "s" into either of the original equations to get the value of "d":
  d = s x 6 = 24 x 6 = 144
Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144km.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep during the forward journey is "d" km.

Let's also assume the speed of the jeep during the forward journey is "s" km/hr.

According to the problem, 

The time taken during the forward journey = 6 hours

The time taken during the return journey = 4 hours

The speed during the return journey = (s + 12) km/hr

We know that, 

distance = speed x time

During the forward journey, 

d = s x 6  ----(Equation 1)

During the return journey, 

d = (s + 12) x 4  ----(Equation 2)

From Equation 1, we get:

s = d/6

Substituting the value of s in Equation 2, we get:

d = (d/6 + 12) x 4

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

d = 144 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is "x" km. 

During the forward journey, the speed of the jeep is "s" km/hr and the time taken is "t1" hours. 

Therefore, we can write the equation: 
x = s * t1  --- (1) 

During the return journey, the speed of the jeep is "s+12" km/hr and the time taken is "t2" hours. 

Therefore, we can write the equation: 
x = (s+12) * t2  --- (2) 

From equation (1), we can write: 
s = x/t1 

Substituting the value of "s" in equation (2), we get: 
x = (x/t1 + 12) * 4 

Simplifying the above equation, we get: 
4x = (x + 12t1) * 4 

4x = x*4 + 48t1 

3x = 48t1 

x = 16t1 

From equation (1), we can also write: 
t1 = x/s 

Substituting the value of "t1" in the above equation, we get: 
t1 = x/(x/t1) 

t1^2 = x 

x = t1^2 

From equation (2), we can also write: 
t2 = x/(s+12) 

Substituting the value of "s" in the above equation, we get: 
t2 = x/((x/t1)+12) 

Substituting the value of "x" in the above equation, we get: 
t2 = t1*(t1+2) / 12 

Now, we can use the given information to form another equation: 
6t1 = x 

4(t1+2) = x/(t1+12) 

Multiplying both sides of the second equation by (t1+12), we get: 
4(t1+2)*(t1+12) = x 

Expanding the above equation, we get: 
4t1^2 + 64t1 + 96 = x 

Substituting the value of "x" from the first equation, we get: 
4t1^2 + 64t1 + 96 = 6t1 

Simplifying the above equation, we get: 
4t1^2 - 14t1 - 24 = 0 

Solving the above quadratic equation, we get: 
t1 = 4 or t1 = -1.5 

Since time cannot be negative, we can ignore the second solution. 

Therefore, t1 = 4 hours. 

Substituting the value of "t1" in the first equation, we get: 
x = s * t1 

Substituting the value of "s" in the above equation, we get: 
x = (x/t1) * t1 

x = t1^2 

Substituting the value of "t1" in the above equation, we get: 
x = 16 * 4 

x = 64 km

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 28
  C: 30
  D: 53
  E: 59
Response 0:
Let's first find the number of doublings required to go from 1 lily to 64 lilies. Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, we need 6 doublings (2^6 = 64). Therefore, it takes 6 * 2 = 12 days for the lake to have 64 lilies.

Now we need to find how many more doublings are required to go from 64 lilies to fully covered. Since the lake doubles every two days, we need 6 more doublings to get to 2^12 = 4096 lilies. Therefore, it takes 6 * 2 = 12 more days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies.

The total number of days is 12 + 12 = 24.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") - The correct answer is not among the choices.
Response 1:
Let's start by finding the number of doublings that occur between 1 and 2^k (where k is the number of doublings). If we start with 1 lily, it takes 60 days to get to 2^k lilies. If we start with 64 lilies, we need to find k such that 64*2^k = 2^(6+k) lilies cover the lake. This gives us the equation 2^(6+k) = 2^(k+1) * 2^(k) = 64*2^k. Solving for k, we get k=3. Therefore, it takes 6+k=9 days to go from 64 to a fully covered lake. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let's solve this problem using exponential growth formula: 

`N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/k)`

where:
- N0 is the initial number of water lilies
- N(t) is the number of water lilies after time t
- k is the doubling time (2 days in this case)

We know that when t = 60, N(60) = 2^30. We can use this information to find k:

2^30 = N0 * 2^(60/k)
2^30 / N0 = 2^(60/k)
30 / log2(N0) = 60/k
k = 60 / (log2(N0) * 30)

Now we can use N0 = 64 and k to find the time it takes for the lake to be fully covered:

N(t) = 64 * 2^(t/k)
2^6 * 2^(t/k) = 2^(30)
2^(t/k + 6) = 2^30
t/k + 6 = 30
t/k = 24
t = 24k = 24 * 60 / (log2(64) * 30) = 53.15

Rounding to the nearest integer, we get t = 53.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let's solve this problem step by step.
First, we need to find out how many times the number of lilies doubles to get from 1 to 2^x (where x is the number of doublings). Since 2^1 = 2, we know that it takes one doubling to get from 1 to 2. 
Next, we need to find out how many doublings it takes to get from 64 to 2^x. We can set up the equation 64 * 2^x = 2^60, and solve for x. 
64 * 2^x = 2^60
2^6 * 2^x = 2^60
2^(6+x) = 2^60
6 + x = 60
x = 54
So it takes 54 doublings to get from 64 to 2^54. Since each doubling takes two days, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 54 * 2 = 108 days.
Answer: Answer("None of the above") -> The correct answer is 108.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's start by finding the growth factor of the water lilies. Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we can say that the growth factor is 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2). 

Now we can use the formula N = N0 * (growth factor)^t, where N is the final number of water lilies, N0 is the initial number of water lilies, growth factor is sqrt(2), and t is the number of days. We want to solve for t when N = 2^6 = 64.

64 = 1 * sqrt(2)^t
64 = sqrt(2)^t
log(64) = log(sqrt(2)^t)
log(64) = t * log(sqrt(2))
t = log(64) / log(sqrt(2))
t = 6 * log(2) / log(2^(1/2))
t = 6 * log(2) / (1/2) = 12 * log(2)

So it would take 12 * log(2) days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Approximately, 12 * log(2) is 8.7 days.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Let's first find the number of doublings required for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if there is only one lily initially. Since the number of lilies double every two days, and the lake is fully covered after 60 days, the number of doublings required is 60/2 = 30.

Now, we need to find how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if there are initially 64 lilies. Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, we can find the number of doublings required for the initial 64 lilies as follows:

64 = 1 x 2^d, where d is the number of doublings required.
d = log2(64) = 6

So, the number of doublings required to cover the lake starting with 64 lilies is 30 - 6 = 24. Since each doubling takes 2 days, the lake will be fully covered after 24 x 2 = 48 days.

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("D") - 53.
Response 7:
Let's first find the growth factor of the water lilies. If the number of lilies doubles every two days, then the growth factor is 2^(1/2) = 1.414.

Let's use the formula for exponential growth: N(t) = N0 * (growth factor)^t, where N0 is the initial number of lilies, t is the time in days, and N(t) is the number of lilies after t days.

We know that N(60) = 2^60, since the number of lilies doubles every two days. We want to find the time it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if initially there were 64 lilies, so we need to solve for t in the equation N(t) = 2^60 starting with N0 = 64.

N(t) = N0 * (growth factor)^t
2^60 = 64 * 1.414^t
2^55 = 1.414^t
log(2^55) = log(1.414^t)
55 * log(2) = t * log(1.414)
t = 55 * log(2) / log(1.414) ≈ 53.06

Rounding to the nearest integer, we get t ≈ 53, so the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 53 days.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's first find out what is the doubling time of the water lilies. We know that the number of water lilies doubles every 2 days. So, after 2 days, there will be 2 water lilies, after 4 days, there will be 4 water lilies, and so on. This means that the initial number of water lilies (1) doubles 30 times (since it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered). So, the doubling time is 2 days.
Now, let's answer the question. If there are initially 64 water lilies on the lake, then after 2 days, there will be 128 water lilies (64 x 2). This means that the lake will be fully covered with water lilies after 2 x 5 = 10 days (since 2^5 = 32 < 64 and 2^6 = 64 < 128). Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 9:
We can start by using the formula for exponential growth: N = N0 * 2^(t/k), where N is the final number of water lilies, N0 is the initial number, t is the time elapsed, and k is the doubling time (in this case, 2 days).

Using the given information, we can set up the following equation:

60 = 1 * 2^(60/2)

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

60 = 2^30

Taking the logarithm of both sides (to base 2), we get:

log2(60) = 30

So the doubling time for this lake is 30 days. 

Now we can use the same formula to find the time it takes for 64 water lilies to fully cover the lake:

N = 64 * 2^(t/30)

We want to solve for t when N = 2^30 (i.e. the lake is fully covered), so we get:

2^30 = 64 * 2^(t/30)

Dividing both sides by 64, we get:

2^25 = 2^(t/30)

Taking the logarithm of both sides (to base 2), we get:

25 = t/30

Solving for t, we get:

t = 750

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 750 days.

Question: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?
Choices:
  A: 40.8
  B: 41.6
  C: 42.2
  D: 43.5
  E: 44.8
Response 0:
Let the weight of the new heavy duty truck be x. 

The sum of the weights of the 10 vehicles before the new truck was added is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons. 

After the new truck was added, the sum of the weights increased to 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons. 

So, we have the equation: 

122 + x = 162.8 

Solving for x: 

x = 40.8 

Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 40.8 tons. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let's solve this question using the formula of the arithmetic mean. 

Let the weight of the new heavy duty truck be x tons.

So, the total weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the new truck is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.

After adding the new truck, there are 11 vehicles with a total weight of (10 * 12.2) + x = 122 + x tons.

The new average weight is given as 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.

So, we can write the equation: (122 + x) / 11 = 14.8

Solving for x, we get x = 41.6

Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 41.6 tons.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let the weight of the new heavy duty truck be x tons. 

The total weight of the 10 vehicles before the new truck was added is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons. 

After the new truck was added, the new total weight becomes 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons (since the average increased by 2.6 tons). 

Therefore, the weight of the new heavy duty truck is x = 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let the weight of the new heavy duty truck be x.
The total weight of the 10 vehicles before the new truck was added is 10*12.2 = 122 tons.
After the new truck was added, the total weight became 11*14.8 = 162.8 tons.
Therefore, we have the equation 122 + x = 162.8.
Solving for x, we get x = 40.8.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's assume the weight of the new heavy duty truck is x tons. Then we can write the equation below to solve for x:
 
(10 * 12.2 + x) / 11 = 12.2 + 2.6

Simplifying this equation, we get:

122 + x = 156.2

x = 34.2

Therefore, the weight of the new heavy duty truck is 34.2 tons.

Action: Answer("None of the above") - The correct answer is not among the choices given.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let the weight of the new truck be x. 

The total weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the new truck is 10 * 12.2 = 122

After adding the new truck, there are 11 vehicles and the new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8

So, the total weight of all 11 vehicles is 11 * 14.8 = 162.8

The weight of the new truck is the difference between the total weight of all 11 vehicles and the total weight of the original 10 vehicles: 

x = 162.8 - 122 = 40.8

Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 40.8 tons.

Question: Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Choices:
  A: 50 %
  B: 60 %
  C: 55 %
  D: 70 %
  E: 58%
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A") 

The cost price of 1 kg of orange = 450/90 = 5
The selling price of 1 kg of orange = Rs. 7.50
Profit per kg of orange = 7.50 - 5 = Rs. 2.50
Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100
Profit percentage = (2.50 / 5) * 100
Profit percentage = 50% 

Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is 50%.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")  

Explanation: 
Total Cost Price of 90 kg of oranges = Rs. 450
Selling Price of 90 kg of oranges = 90 x Rs. 7.50 = Rs. 675
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = Rs. (675 - 450) = Rs. 225
Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) x 100
Profit Percentage = (225 / 450) x 100 = 50%
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A") 

The cost price of 1 kg of oranges = 450/90 = Rs. 5 

The selling price of 1 kg of oranges = Rs. 7.50 

Profit per kg of oranges = Selling price - Cost price = 7.50 - 5 = Rs. 2.50 

Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 = (2.50 / 5) x 100 = 50%

Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let's call the distance between A and B "d". 

We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B and then 90 mph from B to A. 

Let's use "t" to represent the time it took for Kevin to drive from A to B. 

Since distance = rate x time, we can write two equations: 

d = 70t  (from A to B) 

d = 90(t - 3)  (from B to A, 3 hours before the end of the trip) 

We can solve for "t" by setting the two equations equal to each other: 

70t = 90(t - 3) 

70t = 90t - 270 

20t = 270 

t = 13.5 

Now that we know "t", we can use either equation to find "d": 

d = 70t = 70(13.5) = 945 

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 945 miles. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let's first find the time it takes for Kevin to reach point B. Let the distance from A to B be "d". Then, his speed is 70 mph and his time taken is t1 = d/70.

On his return journey, his speed is 90 mph and his time taken is t2 = d/90.

We are given that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B and only 70 miles away from it. This means that he has traveled a total of d-70 miles at this point in time.

Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can write an equation in terms of d:
d-70 = 70t2 + 90(t1-t2-3)

Simplifying this equation, we get:
d-70 = 70(d/90) + 90(d/70 - d/90 - 3)
d-70 = 4d/9 - 6
5d/9 = 64
d = 115.2

Therefore, the distance between A and B is approximately 115.2 miles.

Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let's call the distance between A and B as "d". 

When Kevin drives from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, he takes time "t1" given by:

d = 70 * t1

When he drives back from B to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, he takes time "t2" given by:

d = 90 * t2

We know that he was 70 miles away from B, exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip. Let's call the time he had left to reach A after that point as "t3". 

t3 + 3 = t2

We also know that he covered 70 miles in that time, so we can write:

70 = 70(t2 - t3)

Combining the above equations, we get:

t2 = t1 + 2t3

d = 90(t1 + 2t3)

We can also write:

d = 70t1 + 90(t3 + 3)

Since we have two equations for "d", we can equate them:

70t1 + 90(t3 + 3) = 90(t1 + 2t3)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

20t1 = 270

t1 = 13.5

Substituting this value of "t1" in one of the equations for "d", we get:

d = 70 * 13.5 = 945

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 945 miles.

From the given information, we can form two equations:
xy = 600000   (equation 1)
(x * (y + 60)) = 624000   (equation 2)

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Let the amount received by each nephew be x. Then, each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x.
Total amount = 5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 25x + 16x + 2x = 43x
As per the question, 43x = 8600
Therefore, x = 200
Each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = 800

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let the share of each nephew be x. Then, the share of each daughter is 4x and the share of each son is 5x. 

The total number of people receiving the money is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

39x = 8600 

x = 220 

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4(220) = Rs 880. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each daughter = 4x and share of each son = 5x
Total number of shares = 5+4+2 = 11
Sum of all the shares = 8600
Hence, x = 200
Therefore, each daughter received 4x = 4*200 = Rs 800

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each daughter = 4x and the share of each son = 5x.

Total number of shares = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.
So, x = 8600/11 = 780.

Thus, the share of each daughter = 4x = 4 * 780 = 3120.

Therefore, Answer("C").
Response 4:
Let the amount received by each nephew be x.
Amount received by each daughter = 4x
Amount received by each son = 5x
Total amount received by 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews = 5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 25x + 16x + 2x = 43x
Given, 43x = 8600
Therefore, x = 200
Amount received by each daughter = 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800
Hence, the answer is E: Rs 800.
Response 5:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each daughter is 4x and the share of each son is 5x.
Total number of shares = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
Total amount = Rs 8600

So, x = (8600/11)

Therefore, the share of each daughter = 4x = 4*(8600/11) = Rs 3100

Action: Answer("None of the above")  (The answer should be Rs 3100, which is not one of the available choices)
Response 6:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each daughter = 4x and the share of each son = 5x.

Total number of recipients = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11

Total amount = Rs 8600

Therefore, x(4 + 5*5 + 2) = 8600

=> 29x = 8600

=> x = Rs 296

Hence, each daughter receives 4x = 4*296 = Rs 1184.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let the share of each nephew be x. 
Then, the share of each daughter will be 4x and the share of each son will be 5x. 
The total number of people receiving a share is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. 
Therefore, we can write the equation: 

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 200 

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = Rs 800. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let the amount received by each nephew be x. Then, each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x.
Total number of children = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11
Total amount = Rs 8600

So, 5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
Simplifying the above equation, we get x = 200
Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = Rs 800

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Let the share of each nephew be x
Then, the share of each son = 5x
And, the share of each daughter = 4(share of each nephew) = 4x

Total number of shares = 5 (sons) + 4 (daughters) + 2 (nephews) = 11

Total amount = Rs 8600

Therefore, x + 5x + 4x = 8600/11

10x = 8600/11 * 11/10

x = 860

Hence, each daughter receives 4x = 4*860 = Rs 3440

Let the actual number be x. 
According to the problem, 
7/18 * x + 770 = 7/8 * x
Multiplying both sides by 72 gives us:
28x + 55440 = 63x
Solving for x, we get:
x = 1584.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
First, let's represent the number as "x". 

The student found the value of 7/18 of the number, so we can represent that as (7/18)*x. 

The student was supposed to find the value of 7/8 of the number, so we can represent that as (7/8)*x. 

We know that the student's answer differed from the actual one by 770, so we can set up the equation: 

(7/8)*x - (7/18)*x = 770 

Simplifying: 

(49/72)*x = 770 

Multiplying both sides by (72/49): 

x = 1120 

Therefore, the answer is:

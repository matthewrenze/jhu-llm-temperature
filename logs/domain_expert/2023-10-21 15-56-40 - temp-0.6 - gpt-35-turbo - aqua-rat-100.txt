Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. 

Given,
- 75 employees take a winter vacation
- 40 employees take both winter and summer vacation
- 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacation

Thus, the number of employees taking only winter vacation = (75 - 40) = 35

Now, let's find the number of employees taking summer vacation:
- Total employees taking summer vacation = (100 - 20) * Q%, where Q% is the percentage of employees taking summer vacation but not winter vacation.
- Total employees taking both summer and winter vacation = 40
- Thus, the number of employees taking only summer vacation = (total employees taking summer vacation - employees taking both summer and winter vacation) = [(100 - 20) * Q% - 40]

We know that:
- 75 employees take a winter vacation
- 35 employees take only winter vacation
- 40 employees take both winter and summer vacation
- (20 + Q)% employees take either summer or winter vacation or both

Thus, we have:
75 + 35 + 40 + (20 + Q)% = 100%
=> (90 + Q)% = 100%
=> Q% = 10%

Therefore, the answer is: 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the total number of employees is 100. 
Given, 75% of the employees take a winter vacation. So, the number of employees who take a winter vacation = 75.
Also, 40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations. So, the number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations = 40.
And, 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. So, the number of employees who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation = 20.
Let's assume that Q% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. So, the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation = Q.
Now, we know that the total number of employees is 100. Therefore, the number of employees who take at least one vacation = 100 - 20 = 80.
We can also say that the number of employees who take a winter vacation only = (number of employees who take a winter vacation) - (number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations) = 75 - 40 = 35.
Similarly, the number of employees who take a summer vacation only = Q - 40.
Now, we can say that:
(number of employees who take a winter vacation only) + (number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations) + (number of employees who take a summer vacation only) + (number of employees who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation) = 100
35 + 40 + (Q - 40) + 20 = 100
Q = 45
Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Therefore:
- 75 employees take a winter vacation (75% of 100)
- 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations
- 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacations
We can find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation by using the formula:
(Number of employees who take only summer vacation) = (Number of employees who take summer and winter vacation) - (Number of employees who take neither summer nor winter vacation)
(Number of employees who take only summer vacation) = 40 - 20 = 20
Therefore, 20 employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
The percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is:
(Percentage of employees who take only summer vacation) = (Number of employees who take only summer vacation) / (Total number of employees) * 100%
(Percentage of employees who take only summer vacation) = 20 / 100 * 100% = 20%
So, the answer is: Action: Answer("B") 15%.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. According to the problem, 75% of them take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation. Also, 20% of them take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither. Therefore, the remaining employees who take at least one vacation are 100-20=80 employees. 

Now, we know that 40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations, which means 40% of 75 (the number of employees who take a winter vacation) take both winter and summer vacations. This is equal to 30 employees. Therefore, the number of employees who take only a winter vacation is 75-30=45 employees.

Finally, we want to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. Let's call this percentage Q. We know that 80 employees in total take at least one vacation, and we have already accounted for 45 employees who take only a winter vacation. Therefore, the number of employees who take a summer vacation is 80-45=35 employees. 

So, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is (35/100) x 100% = 35%. 

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("D") 35%.
Response 5:
Let's assume that the total number of employees in the company is 100.
If 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, then 25% of the employees do not take a winter vacation. 
If 40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations, then 35% of the employees take only a winter vacation. 
If 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, then 80% of the employees take at least one vacation. 

To find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we need to subtract the percentage of employees who take both vacations from the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation. 

Therefore, Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation = (100% - 75% - 20%) - (40% - 35%) = 5%

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the total number of employees is 100. 

Since 75 percent of the employees take a winter vacation, 100 - 75 = 25 percent of the employees do not take a winter vacation. 

Out of these employees who do not take a winter vacation, 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. Therefore, 25 - 20 = 5 percent of the employees do not take a winter vacation but take a summer vacation. 

Now, out of the 75 percent of the employees who take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation. Therefore, 40 percent of 75 percent = 30 percent of the employees take both winter and summer vacation. 

So, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation = Percentage of employees who take a summer vacation - Percentage of employees who take both winter and summer vacation 
= Q - 30 

We know that 20 percent of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. Therefore, 
100 = 75 + 5 + 30 + (Q - 30) + 20 

Solving this equation, we get Q =  15 

Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 15 percent. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's assume that the total number of employees is 100. Then, we can use a Venn diagram to represent the given information.

Based on the diagram, we can see that:
- 75 employees take a winter vacation (75% of 100)
- 40 employees take both a winter and a summer vacation
- 20 employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation
Therefore, 15 employees take only a summer vacation (since 75 - 40 - 20 = 15).

To find Q percent, we need to determine what percentage of the total number of employees (100) is represented by the 15 employees who take only a summer vacation. This is simply:
15/100 = 0.15 = 15%

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 10
  C: 12
  D: 15
  E: 19
Response 0:
First, let's determine how many cakes each helper can make in one hour.
- Each helper can make 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.
- If we add these together, each helper can make (2+35) = 37 cakes per hour.

Next, let's calculate how many cakes we need to make in total.
- We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
- 20 large cakes is equivalent to 20 x 2 = 40 small cakes.
- So we need a total of 40 + 700 = 740 small cakes.

Now we can determine how many helpers are needed.
- Each helper can make 37 cakes per hour.
- We need to make 740 cakes in total.
- So we need 740/37 = 20 helpers.
- However, we only have 3 hours available.
- So we need to divide the total number of cakes by the number of hours available: 740/3 = 246.67 cakes per hour.
- We need to round up to the nearest whole number, since we can't have a fraction of a helper.
- Therefore, we need 247/37 = 6.68, which rounds up to 7 helpers.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") - The correct answer is 7, which is not one of the available choices.
Response 1:
Let's assume the number of helpers required to make the large cakes is x, and the number of helpers required to make the small cakes is y. 

We can form two equations based on the given information.

Equation 1: 2x + 35y = (total number of helpers) * 3    (as the kitchen is available for 3 hours)
Equation 2: 20 = 2x  (as 20 large cakes are needed and each helper can make 2 large cakes/hr)
                700 = 35y  (as 700 small cakes are needed and each helper can make 35 small cakes/hr)

Substituting equation 2 in equation 1, we get:

2(10) + 35y = (total number of helpers) * 3
20 + 35y = 3(total number of helpers)
35y = 3(total number of helpers) - 20

Substituting equation 3 in equation 4, we get:

35y = 3(total number of helpers) - 20
35y = 3x + 15
7y = 3x + 3

We know that both x and y are positive integers, so we can try different values of y until we get a positive integer value for x. 

Trying y = 1, we get:

7(1) = 3x + 3
4 = 3x
x = 4/3  (not a positive integer)

Trying y = 2, we get:

7(2) = 3x + 3
11 = 3x
x = 11/3  (not a positive integer)

Trying y = 3, we get:

7(3) = 3x + 3
18 = 3x
x = 6

Therefore, we need 6 helpers to make the required number of cakes.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's assume that x helpers are required.
Therefore, the number of large cakes made in 3 hours by x helpers = 2 * x * 3 = 6x
And, the number of small cakes made in 3 hours by x helpers = 35 * x * 3 = 105x

We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
So, 6x >= 20  =>  x >= 20/6 = 10/3
    105x >= 700 => x >= 20/3

Therefore, the minimum number of helpers required is ceil(10/3) = 4.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's assume that there are x helpers required to prepare the cakes.
Therefore, the number of large cakes prepared by x helpers in 3 hours = 2x*3 = 6x
And, the number of small cakes prepared by x helpers in 3 hours = 35x*3 = 105x
We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, so we can write:
6x = 20  ...........(i)
105x = 700 ...........(ii)
Solving equations (i) and (ii), we get:
x = 10
Therefore, we need 10 helpers to prepare the required number of cakes.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let's assume that the number of helpers required to make large cakes is x, and the number of helpers required to make small cakes is y.

From the given information, we can write two equations:
2x + 35y ≤ 3*60 (total time available is 3 hours)
20x + 700y = total number of cakes needed

We need to find the value of x.

To solve this problem, we can use substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the substitution method.

From the first equation, we can write:
y ≤ (3*60 - 2x)/35

Substituting this value of y in the second equation, we get:
20x + 700[(3*60 - 2x)/35] = total number of cakes needed

Simplifying this equation, we get:
20x + 1200 - 40x = total number of cakes needed
-20x = total number of cakes needed - 1200
x = (1200 - total number of cakes needed)/20

Substituting the given values, we get:
x = (1200 - 20*20 - 700)/20
x = 5

Therefore, 5 helpers are required to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 5:
First, let's find out how many cakes can be made in 3 hours by one helper:
- One helper can make 2 large cakes/hour * 3 hours = 6 large cakes
- One helper can make 35 small cakes/hour * 3 hours = 105 small cakes
So, one helper can make a total of 6 + 105 = 111 cakes in 3 hours.

To make 20 large cakes, we need 20 large cakes / 2 large cakes/hour = 10 hours of work by one helper.
To make 700 small cakes, we need 700 small cakes / 35 small cakes/hour = 20 hours of work by one helper.

Since we have 3 hours available, we can use at most 3 helpers. Let's see how many cakes they can make together:
- Three helpers can make 3 * 111 = 333 cakes in 3 hours.
- We need 20 + 700 = 720 cakes in total.
- That means we still need 720 - 333 = 387 cakes.

One helper can make 111 cakes in 3 hours, so they can make 387 cakes / 111 cakes/3 hours = 11 hours of work.
Therefore, we need at least 4 helpers to finish the job in 3 hours. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's denote the number of helpers needed as "x".
The amount of time needed to make 20 large cakes is (20 cakes / x helpers) * (1 hour / 2 large cakes) = 10/x hours.
The amount of time needed to make 700 small cakes is (700 cakes / x helpers) * (1 hour / 35 small cakes) = 20/x hours.
Since the kitchen is available for a total of 3 hours, we can set up the following equation: 10/x + 20/x <= 3.
Simplifying this inequality, we get: 30/x <= 3, which means that x >= 10.
Therefore, we need at least 10 helpers.
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Let's assume we need x helpers.
Each helper can make 2 large cakes/hr, so x helpers can make 2x large cakes/hr.
Each helper can make 35 small cakes/hr, so x helpers can make 35x small cakes/hr.
We need 20 large cakes, so it will take 20/(2x) hrs to make the large cakes.
We need 700 small cakes, so it will take 700/(35x) hrs to make the small cakes.
We have 3 hours available, so:
20/(2x) + 700/(35x) <= 3
10/x + 20/x <= 3
30/x <= 3
x >= 10
So we need at least 10 helpers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let's assume the number of helpers required is `x`.

Total number of large cakes made by `x` helpers in 3 hours = 2 * x * 3 = 6x

Total number of small cakes made by `x` helpers in 3 hours = 35 * x * 3 = 105x

We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.

So, 6x >= 20   =>   x >= 20/6   =>   x >= 3.33   (rounding up to next integer value)
And, 105x >= 700   =>   x >= 6.67   (rounding up to next integer value)

Therefore, `x` should be greater than or equal to 7. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes. 
Then, the number of large cakes made in 3 hours is 2 * x * 3 = 6x. 
Similarly, the number of small cakes made in 3 hours is 35 * x * 3 = 105x. 
To make 20 large cakes, we need 20 large cakes / 2 = 10 hours of work by one helper. 
To make 700 small cakes, we need 700 small cakes / 35 = 20 hours of work by one helper. 
So, the total time required for x helpers is 10 * x + 20 * x = 30x. 
We know that the kitchen is available for 3 hours, so we get: 
30x <= 3 * (20 + 700) 
30x <= 660 
x <= 22 
Therefore, we need at least x = 22/3 = 7.33 helpers, which means we need 8 helpers.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
Choices:
  A: 4,000
  B: 4,200
  C: 4,500
  D: 4,800
  E: 5,000
Response 0:
Let x be the number of staplers produced on Monday. 

The number of defective staplers produced is 0.1x. 
The number of non-defective staplers produced is 0.9x (since 10% are defective, then 90% are non-defective).

Out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. 

The number of non-defective staplers rejected is 0.02 * 0.9x = 0.018x. 

We know that 72 staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation:

0.018x = 72

Solving for x:

x = 4000

Answer: Answer("A") 4000.
Response 1:
Let's call the number of staplers produced on Monday "x". 

10% of the staplers were defective, so 0.10x were defective. 
This means that 0.90x were non-defective. 

Of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. 
This means that 0.02(0.90x) = 0.018x were non-defective staplers that were rejected. 

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up an equation: 

0.018x = 72 

Solving for x: 

x = 4000 

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4,000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's say the number of staplers produced on Monday is "x". 

10% of the staplers were defective, so 0.1x staplers were defective. 
The remaining non-defective staplers were (x - 0.1x) = 0.9x.
Out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected, so 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x staplers were rejected.
We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so:
0.018x = 72
x = 4,000

Therefore, the answer is A: 4,000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the total number of non-defective staplers produced. We know that 90% of the staplers produced on Monday were not defective, so we can set up the following equation:

0.90x = number of non-defective staplers produced

We also know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so we can set up the following equation:

0.02(0.90x) = 72

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0.018x = 72

x = 4000

Therefore, the total number of staplers produced on Monday was:

0.10(4000) + 0.90(4000) = 400 + 3600 = 4000

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the number of staplers produced on Monday is 'x'.
The number of defective staplers produced on Monday = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday = 90% of x = 0.9x

The number of non-defective staplers rejected = 2% of the number of non-defective staplers produced = 0.02 * 0.9x = 0.018x
We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation:

0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day is 4000.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let's call the total number of staplers produced on Monday "x". 

10% of the staplers were defective, so 0.1x staplers were defective. 

That means the remaining (1 - 0.1) x staplers were non-defective. 

Out of those non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up an equation: 

0.02(0.9x) = 72 

Simplifying: 

0.018x = 72 

x = 4000 

So the total number of staplers produced on Monday was 4000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let's first calculate the number of defective staplers produced on Monday. Let's assume that the factory produced x staplers on Monday. Therefore, the number of defective staplers produced is 0.1x. 

Now, let's figure out the number of non-defective staplers produced. This is equal to the total number of staplers produced (x) minus the number of defective staplers (0.1x), so it's 0.9x. 

We know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, which means that 0.02 * 0.9x = 72. 

Solving for x: 

0.018x = 72 

x = 4000 

So, the answer is A: 4,000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's assume that the factory produced "x" staplers on Monday.
The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers produced = 90% of x = 0.9x
Out of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake.
So, the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected = 2% of 0.9x = 0.018x
We know that the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected = 72.
Therefore, 0.018x = 72
Solving for x, we get x = 4000.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let's assume that the total number of staplers produced on Monday was x. 

The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x 
The number of non-defective staplers produced = 90% of x = 0.9x 

Now, 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. 
So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 2% of 0.9x = 0.018x 

We know that the number of non-defective staplers rejected was 72. 
So, we can write: 

0.018x = 72 

Solving for x: 

x = 4000 

Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day was 4000.

Topic: Math
Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring. Then, the probability of at least one of the events A or B occurring is given by:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Substituting the given values, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E").
Response 1:
Let's use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) to solve the problem. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B). We can substitute the given values and solve for P(B):

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 2:
Let P(B) = x
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6x
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + x - 0.6x = 0.96
Simplifying the equation: 0.4x = 0.36
Thus, x = 0.9

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Since events A and B are independent, the probability that both events occur is P(A) * P(B). Therefore, the probability that at least one of the events occurs is:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B)
Substituting the given values, we have:
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 * P(B)
Simplifying and solving for P(B), we get:
P(B) = 0.8

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let P(B) = x. 

P(A) = 0.6

P(A or B) = 0.96

We know that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), where P(A and B) is the probability that both A and B occur. 

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6x.

Therefore, 

0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x

Solving the above equation, we get x = 0.8.

Hence, the answer is Action: Answer("D").
Response 5:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B. Then, we know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. 

We can use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) since A and B are independent. 

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6)(P(B))
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring.
Since A and B are independent, we have:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96, so we can solve for P(B):
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let P(B) = x. Then P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + x - 0.6x. We know that P(A or B) = 0.96. Therefore, 

0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x 

Solving for x, we get x = 0.8. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. 

We know that the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. This means that the probability that neither A nor B occurs is 1 - 0.96 = 0.04.

Since A and B are independent events, we can use the formula P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) to find the probability that both events occur. 

We can also use the fact that the probability of the union of two events is given by P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

Putting these two equations together, we can write:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6*P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4*P(B)
0.36 = 0.4*P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Let P(B) = x. Then, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + x - 0.6x = 0.96

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
Choices:
  A: 80
  B: 120
  C: 240
  D: 320
  E: 360
Response 0:
Let's say the store had 'y' yellow golf balls and 'w' white golf balls at the beginning of the day. We know that the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, so the total number of golf balls sold is 0.8*600 = 480. We also know that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, so the number of white golf balls sold is 'w'. Therefore, the number of yellow golf balls sold is also 'w'. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know that 'w' = the initial number of white golf balls, which is 600 - 'y'. We can now create an equation to solve for 'y':

'w' + 'y' = 480
(600 - 'y') + 'y' = 480
600 = 480 + 'y'
'y' = 120

Therefore, the store had 120 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's say the store had y yellow golf balls and w white golf balls to begin with. We know that y + w = 600.  

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold is equal to w. We also know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, so 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls were sold. Since all of the white golf balls were sold, the remaining 480 - w golf balls sold were yellow.

We can now set up an equation based on the information above:
w = 480 - w
2w = 480
w = 240

So the store had 240 white golf balls to begin with. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it also had 240 yellow golf balls to begin with.

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C") 240.
Response 2:
Let's work backwards from the information given. We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls. We also know that it sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Therefore, the number of white golf balls sold is half of the total number of golf balls sold. 

If the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, then it sold 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls. Half of these are white, so the store sold 240 white golf balls. This means that the store started with 600 - 240 = 360 yellow golf balls.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let's solve the problem step by step:
- The store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, which means it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls.
- Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 240 white golf balls (half of the total sold).
- Therefore, the store had 360 yellow golf balls to begin the day (600 - 240 white golf balls).

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's say that the store had y yellow golf balls and w white golf balls at the beginning of the day, so we know that y + w = 600. 

We also know that the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, so it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and sold all of its white golf balls, we know that the store sold w white golf balls. Therefore, the store sold y yellow golf balls, and we have:

y + w = 600
y + y = 480
2y = 480
y = 240

So the store had 240 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's first find out how many golf balls were sold by the end of the day:
Number of golf balls sold = 80% of 600 = 480
Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and sold all of its white golf balls, we can conclude that the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the total number of white golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day. Therefore, the number of yellow golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day is equal to the number of golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day minus the number of white golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day, which is:
Number of yellow golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day = 600 - (1/2) * 480 = 360
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let's start by finding out how many golf balls were sold by the end of the day. If the store had 600 golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day, and it sold 80% of its inventory, then it sold:

0.80 x 600 = 480 golf balls

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and it sold all of its white golf balls, then it must have sold:

480 / 2 = 240 white golf balls

This means that at the beginning of the day, the store had:

600 - 240 = 360 golf balls remaining, which were all yellow

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E") 360.
Response 9:
Let's assume the store had y yellow golf balls and w white golf balls at the beginning of the day. We know that y + w = 600. 

We also know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, so it sold 480 golf balls (0.8 x 600). Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it must have sold 240 of each. 

We're told that the store sold all of its white golf balls, so w = 0. Therefore, y = 600 - w = 600 - 0 = 600.

Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs. 126.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let the fare of one person travelling by train be x
Then the fare for two persons travelling by bus = (4/3)*x
Total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus = 6*(4/3)*x = 8x
Total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train = 8x
Given, Total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train = Rs.1512
Therefore, 8x + 6*(4/3)*x = 1512
Simplifying, we get x = 126

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
Choices:
  A: 20%
  B: 25%
  C: 30%
  D: 35%
  E: 40%
Response 0:
Let F be the amount of food in the bowl at the start.
At 9:00 am, the dog has eaten 1/3 of F, so 2/3 of F remains.
At 10:00 am, the dog has eaten 1/3 of 2/3 of F, so 4/9 of F remains.
At 11:00 am, the dog has eaten 1/3 of 4/9 of F, so 8/27 of F remains.
At noon, the dog has eaten 1/3 of 8/27 of F, so 16/81 of F remains.
Therefore, the percentage of the original food remaining is:
(16/81) / F = 16/81 * 1/F * 100% = 19.75% (approximately)
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
At 9:00 am, the dog had eaten 1/3 of the initial amount, which means 2/3 of the original amount was left. At 10:00 am, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 2/3, which is (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 of the original amount. Subtracting 2/9 from 2/3, we get 4/9 of the original amount left at 10:00 am. At 11:00 am, the dog ate (1/3) * (4/9) = 4/27 of the original amount. Subtracting 4/27 from 4/9, we get 44/81 of the original amount left at 11:00 am. Finally, at 12:00 pm, the dog ate (1/3) * (44/81) = 44/243 of the original amount. Subtracting 44/243 from 44/81, we get 860/2187 of the original amount left at noon. To find the percentage of the original amount remaining, we divide this fraction by 1 and multiply by 100: (860/2187) * 100 ≈ 39.32%.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food every hour. 

After the first hour (at 9:00 am), the dog will have eaten 1/3 of the original amount, leaving 2/3 of the original amount in the bowl. 

After the second hour (at 10:00 am), the dog will have eaten 1/3 of the remaining amount (which is 2/3 of the original amount), leaving 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 of the original amount in the bowl. 

After the third hour (at 11:00 am), the dog will have eaten 1/3 of the remaining amount (which is 4/9 of the original amount), leaving 2/3 * 4/9 = 8/27 of the original amount in the bowl. 

Finally, at noon, the dog will have eaten 1/3 of the remaining amount (which is 8/27 of the original amount), leaving 2/3 * 8/27 = 16/81 of the original amount in the bowl. 

Therefore, right before the dog began to eat at noon, there was approximately 16/81 of the original amount of food in the bowl. To express this as a percentage, we can divide 16/81 by the original amount and multiply by 100:

(16/81) ÷ 1 * 100 ≈ 19.75 ≈ 20%

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
Choices:
  A: $8
  B: $10
  C: $13.6
  D: $22.9
  E: $40
Response 0:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be $x.
After decreasing the price by 15%, the new selling price of each article is (x - 0.15x) = 0.85x.
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300.
So, the new selling price of 5 articles is $300.
Hence, 5 * 0.85x = $300.
Solving the above equation, we get x = $70.
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 0.85 * 70 = $59.5.
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") [The closest answer is (C) $13.6, but it is not the correct answer.]
Response 1:
Solution:
Let the original selling price of each article be x.
Since the price of each article has decreased by 15%, the new selling price of each article will be 0.85x.
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so she was able to buy (5+x) articles for $300 before the price decrease.
We can write the following equation to solve for x:
x * 0.85x = (5+x) * (300/5)
0.85x^2 = 60 + 60x
0.85x^2 - 60x - 60 = 0
x^2 - 70.59x - 70.59 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
x = 13.6 or x = -5.19
Since x represents the original selling price of each article, we can ignore the negative solution.
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x = 0.85 * 13.6 = $11.56.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the decrease of 15%, the new price becomes (100%-15%)x = 85% of x = 0.85x.
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the new price of 5 articles is $300.
Therefore, the new price of each article is ($300/5) = $60.
Let's equate this to the new price of each article after the decrease: 
$60 = 0.85x + 5
$55 = 0.85x
x = $64.71 (rounded to two decimal places)

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let the original price of each article be $x. 

After a 15% decrease, the new price of each article is 0.85x. 

Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles decreased by 5x. 

We can set up the equation: 

5x = 300 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 60 

So the original price of each article was $60. 

The new price of each article after the 15% decrease is: 

0.85(60) = $51 

Action: Answer("None of the above") - The correct answer is not among the choices given.
Response 5:
Let the original price of each article be x. Since the price of each article decreased by 15%, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x. 

We know that Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300. So, the original number of articles she could buy for $300 is 300/x. With the new price, she can buy 5 more articles, so the new number of articles she can buy for $300 is 300/(0.85x). 

Since she can buy 5 more articles with the same amount of money, we can set up an equation: 

300/x = 300/(0.85x) + 5 

Solving for x, we get x = 20. 

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x = 0.85(20) = $17. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Solution:
Let the original selling price of each article be x. 
After a 15% decrease in the price, Anna pays 85% of the original price for each article. 
So, the new selling price of each article is 0.85x.
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so she was able to buy (5+x) articles for the original price. 
Therefore,
x(5+x) = (5+x)0.85x + 300
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
0.15x^2 - 5.25x + 300 = 0
Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
x = 20 or x = 25
Since the original selling price of each article cannot be greater than $300/5 = $60, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("A") $8
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After a 15% discount, the new price becomes 0.85x.
Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, so:
5x = 300
x = 60
The new price is:
0.85x = 0.85(60) = 51
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is $51.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Solution:

Let P be the original price of each article.
After the discount of 15%, the new price of each article is:

P - 0.15P = 0.85P

Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, so:

5(0.85P) = 300

Simplifying the equation:

4.25P = 300

P = 70.59

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:

0.85P = 0.85(70.59) = $60

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's start by considering the number of ways students can select their two favorite songs. There are 10 choices for the first song and 9 choices left for the second song (since they can't choose the same song twice), making a total of 10*9 = 90 ways to choose two songs. We know that each song was selected 5 times, so if we divide 90 by 5, we get the number of students surveyed: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
First, we know that each song was selected 5 times. Since each student selected 2 songs, that means there were 2*5=10 selections made by each student. 

Let x be the number of students surveyed. 

Then, the total number of selections made by all the students would be 10x. 

However, since each student made 2 selections, we know that the total number of selections made by all the students would also be 2 times the number of students, or 2x. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 

10x = 2x 

Simplifying, we get: 

8x = 0 

Since 8x must be equal to 0 in order for this equation to hold, that means x must be 0. 

But this doesn't make sense - how can we have surveyed 0 students? 

Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".

Question: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 1120
  C: 792
  D: 1320
  E: 1200
Response 0:
Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively.
When folded along the length, the new perimeter becomes 48 cm. Hence, we get:
2(l/2+b)=48
l+b=24   ----(1)
When folded along the breadth, the new perimeter becomes 66 cm. Hence, we get:
2(l+b/2)=66
l+b=33   ----(2)
Solving equations (1) and (2), we get:
l=15 and b=9
Area of the sheet = l*b = 15*9 = 135 sq.cm
Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E") 1200.
Response 1:
First, let's assume that the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet are x and y respectively. When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. Since the sheet is folded into two equal halves, the length of each part will be x/2 and the breadth will be y. Therefore, we can write:

2(x/2 + y) = 48
x + 2y = 48

Similarly, when folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. Since the sheet is folded into two equal halves, the length of each part will be x and the breadth will be y/2. Therefore, we can write:

2(x + y/2) = 66
x + y = 66/2
x + y = 33

Now we have two equations:

x + 2y = 48
x + y = 33

Solving these equations, we get:

x = 15
y = 9

Therefore, the area of the sheet is:

Area = length x breadth
Area = x y
Area = 15 x 9
Area = 135

Action: Answer("None of the Above") 

The correct answer is not among the choices. The correct answer is 135.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let L and B be the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet, respectively.
When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is (48/2) - B = 24 - B.
When folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the length of each part is (66/2) - L = 33 - L.
Now, we know that the length of both parts is the same. So,
24 - B = 33 - L
=> L - B = 9
Also, the perimeter of the rectangle is 2(L + B) = 48 + 66 = 114.
=> L + B = 57
Solving these equations, we get L = 33 and B = 24.
Therefore, the area of the rectangular sheet is L x B = 33 x 24 = 792.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively.
When folded along the length, each part will have a perimeter of 48/2 = 24 cm.
So, we have 2l + b = 24. (Equation 1)
When folded along the breadth, each part will have a perimeter of 66/2 = 33 cm.
So, we have 2b + l = 33. (Equation 2)

Solving equations 1 and 2 simultaneously, we get:
l = 15 and b = 6

The area of the sheet = l * b = 15 * 6 = 90 sq.cm

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("None of the above").
Response 6:
Let's assume that the length and width of the rectangular sheet are "l" and "w", respectively. 

When folded along the length "l", each part will have a width of "w/2". Therefore, the perimeter of each part will be:

2(l + w/2) = 2l + w 

We know that this is equal to 48cm, so:

2l + w = 48 

Similarly, when folded along the width "w", each part will have a length of "l/2". Therefore, the perimeter of each part will be:

2(w + l/2) = 2w + l 

We know that this is equal to 66cm, so:

2w + l = 66 

We now have two equations with two variables. We can solve for "l" and "w" by adding the two equations:

3l/2 + 3w/2 = 114 

Simplifying:

l + w = 76 

We can now substitute this value of "l + w" into one of the original equations to solve for either "l" or "w". Let's use the first equation:

2l + w = 48 

Substituting "l + w = 76":

2(l + w) - w = 48 

2(76) - w = 48 

w = 104/2 = 52cm 

Now that we know the value of "w", we can use either of the original equations to solve for "l". Let's use the second equation:

2w + l = 66 

Substituting "w = 52cm":

2(52) + l = 66 

l = 62cm 

The area of the rectangular sheet is:

A = l * w = 62cm * 52cm = 3,224cm² 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's assume the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b, respectively. 

When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. Therefore, the length of each part will be 24cm. 

That is, l = 24 + 24 = 48, and b = 48 - 2b (since the perimeter of each part is 48cm) 

Similarly, when folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. Therefore, the length of each part will be 33cm. 

That is, l = 33 + 33 = 66, and b = 66 - 2b 

Solving the above two equations, we get b = 12cm and l = 72cm. 

Therefore, the area of the sheet = l * b = 72 * 12 = 864 sq.cm

  A: 2 miles
  B: 2.25 miles
  C: 3.25 miles
  D: 3.85 miles
  E: 2.85 miles
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. 21 minutes is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Distance = Speed × Time

Distance = 11 × 0.35 = 3.85 miles

Therefore, the answer is D: 3.85 miles.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
To solve the problem, first convert 21 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 21/60 = 0.35 hours. On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph. To find the distance he can travel, multiply his speed by the time: 11 * 0.35 = 3.85 miles. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula:
distance = rate x time

On a normal day, Bill's speed is 15 mph. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed is now 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

We want to find how far he can travel in 21 minutes, which is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

So, distance = rate x time = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("D").

Question: In a bag of red and green sweets, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, how many red sweets are there?
Choices:
  A: 90
  B: 80
  C: 95
  D: 100
  E: 85
Response 0:
Let's first find the ratio of red sweets to green sweets in terms of 120 (the number of green sweets). 

If the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, then the total ratio is 3+4=7. 

To find the ratio of red sweets, we can do: 

3/7 = x/120 

where x is the number of red sweets. 

Cross-multiplying gives: 

3 x 120 = 7 x 

Simplifying: 

x = 360/7 

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get: 

x ≈ 51 

So there are approximately 51 red sweets. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above") 

(Note: None of the answer choices provided are close to the correct answer)
Response 1:
Solution: 

Let's assume the number of red sweets is 3x. 

According to the problem, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. 

Therefore, the number of green sweets is 4x. 

We know that the bag contains 120 green sweets. 

So, 4x = 120 

x = 30 

Therefore, the number of red sweets is 3x = 3(30) = 90. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 2:
First, we need to find the number of green sweets for every one red sweet. The ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, which means the bag contains 3+4=7 parts in total. Therefore, each part is 120/4=<<120/4=30>>30. To find the number of red sweets, we multiply the number of parts that are red by 30. Since the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, the bag contains 3 parts of red sweets. Therefore, the number of red sweets in the bag is 3*30=<<3*30=90>>90.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's start by finding the total number of sweets in the bag. If the ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4, then the total ratio is 3+4=7. This means that there are 7 parts in the bag. 

To find the number of red sweets, we need to figure out how many parts out of 7 represent red sweets. Since the ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4, we know that 3 parts out of 7 represent red sweets. 

We are given that there are 120 green sweets, which is 4 parts out of 7. We can set up a proportion to find the total number of sweets in the bag:

4/7 = 120/x

where x is the total number of sweets in the bag. Solving for x, we get:

x = 210

So there are 210 sweets in the bag. To find the number of red sweets, we can use the ratio of 3:4:

3/7 * 210 = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let's assume that the total number of friends who planned to go on a picnic is "x". 
Therefore, the total amount they would have to contribute without the absence of four friends is 96/x. 
But since only (x-4) friends attended the picnic, the total amount they contributed was (96/x) + 4. 

We can now form the equation: 
96/x + 4 = 96/x-4 

Multiplying both sides by x(x-4), we get: 
96(x-4) + 4x(x-4) = 96x 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 
x^2 - 24x - 320 = 0 

We can now factorize the equation: 
(x-20)(x+16) = 0 

Therefore, x = 20 or x = -16. 
Since the number of friends cannot be negative, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("A") 
Response 5:
Let's assume that the total number of friends who planned to go on a picnic was "x". Therefore, the amount each person was supposed to contribute was 96/x. 

However, 4 people did not turn up, so the new total number of people who attended the picnic was (x-4). They had to contribute an additional Rs. 4 each, so the new contribution per person was (96/x) + 4.

We can now create an equation based on the above information:

96/x = (96/x) + 4
Solving the above equation, we get:
4/x = 4
x = 4

Therefore, the initial number of friends who planned to go on a picnic was 8. However, only (8-4) = 4 showed up, and each of them had to contribute an additional Rs. 4.

  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to find the smallest number that satisfies the given conditions. Let x be the total number of students in the school. Then we have:

- 20% of x took physics, which is 0.2x students
- 28% of x took math, which is 0.28x students

The total number of students who took either physics or math is the sum of these two quantities:

0.2x + 0.28x = 0.48x

We know that this number is greater than 501, so we can write:

0.48x > 501

x > 501 / 0.48

x > 1043.75

The least possible integer value of x that satisfies this inequality is 1044. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to assume that all students who took physics also took math. This means that the total number of students who took either physics or math is 20% + (28% - 20%) = 28% of the total number of students in the school. 

Let x be the total number of students in the school. Then:

0.28x > 501

x > 501 / 0.28

x > 1793. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 1794.

However, none of the answer choices match our result. Therefore, the answer is: Answer("E") none of these.
Response 5:
To find the least possible number of students, we assume that the students who took physics and math are different. Therefore, the minimum number of students will be when none of the students took both physics and math. 

Let's assume there are n students in the school. 

Number of students who took physics = 20% of n = 0.2n
Number of students who took math = 28% of n = 0.28n

Since none of the students took both physics and math, the total number of students in the school is:

0.2n + 0.28n = 0.48n

We know that the number of students is more than 501. 

0.48n > 501 

n > 501/0.48 

n > 1043.75 

The least possible integer value of n that satisfies the above inequality is 1044. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
To find the minimum number of students, we assume that all the students who took Physics also took Math. In that case, the number of students who took Math is a subset of the number of students who took Physics. Therefore, we can use the number of students who took Physics to find the minimum number of students.

Let X be the number of students who took Physics. Then we know that:

X/total number of students = 20/100 = 0.2
total number of students = X/0.2

Similarly, we can find the number of students who took Math:

Y/total number of students = 28/100 = 0.28
Y = 0.28 * total number of students

Since Y is a subset of X, we can say that:

Y <= X
0.28 * total number of students <= X
total number of students <= X/0.28

Putting it all together, we get:

total number of students <= X/0.28
total number of students <= (0.2/0.28) * X
total number of students <= 0.714 * X

We know that X is an integer, so we need to find the smallest integer N such that:

N > 0.714 * X

We can try different values of X to find the smallest N. For example:

If X = 1000, then N = 715
If X = 2000, then N = 1430
If X = 3000, then N = 2145
If X = 4000, then N = 2860
If X = 5000, then N = 3575

Therefore, the minimum possible number of students is 3575, which is not one of the given choices. Therefore, the answer is E: none of these.

Question: A man walks at 5 kmph for 6 hrs and at 4 kmph for 12 hrs. His average speed is
Choices:
  A: 4 1/3 km/h
  B: 7 2/3 km/h
  C: 9 ½ km/h
  D: 8 km/h
  E: 81 km/h
Response 0:
Solution: 

Total distance traveled = Distance covered in 1st 6 hrs + Distance covered in next 12 hrs

Distance covered in 1st 6 hrs = 5 kmph × 6 hrs = 30 km

Distance covered in next 12 hrs = 4 kmph × 12 hrs = 48 km

Total distance traveled = 30 km + 48 km = 78 km

Total time taken = 6 hrs + 12 hrs = 18 hrs

Average speed = Total distance traveled / Total time taken

Average speed = 78 km / 18 hrs = 4 1/3 km/h

Therefore, the answer is A: 4 1/3 km/h

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
Let's start with calculating the yearly production cost of 420 units per month:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months = $554,400

To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue should be:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + $626,400 = $1,180,800

The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly revenue of $1,180,800 can be calculated as follows:
Minimum selling price per component = Yearly revenue/Yearly units produced
Yearly units produced = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units
Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800/5,040 units = $234/unit

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C") $240.
Response 1:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 components/month * $110/component * 12 months = $554,400
To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue from sales must be:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + $626,400 = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800
To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee this revenue, we can divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced in a year:
Minimum selling price = Yearly revenue / Yearly production = $1,180,800 / (420 components/month * 12 months) = $230
Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("B") 
Response 2:
Let's first calculate the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months/year = $554,400

To make a yearly profit of $626,400, the revenue from sales must be at least:
Revenue = Yearly production cost + Yearly profit = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

The minimum selling price per component can be calculated as follows:
Minimum selling price = Revenue / Total units produced per year
Total units produced per year = 420 units/month x 12 months/year = 5,040 units/year

Minimum selling price = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units/year = $234.13

The closest answer choice is (C) 240, but the correct answer is actually not one of the given choices, so the answer is None of the Above.
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months/year = $554,400/year

To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue must be:
Yearly revenue = $554,400/year + $626,400/year = $1,180,800/year

To find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced per year:
Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800/year ÷ 420 units/month * 12 months/year = $230

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("B") 230.
Response 4:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months/year = $554,400/year

To calculate the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, we need to use the following formula:
Yearly profit = (Selling price - Production cost) * Number of units sold per year

We know that the number of units sold per year is 420 units/month * 12 months/year = 5,040 units/year

Substituting the values we know, we get:
$626,400 = (Selling price - $110) * 5,040

Solving for Selling price:
Selling price = ($626,400/5,040) + $110 = $230

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $230.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
First, let's calculate the annual production cost:
Annual production cost = $110/component x 420 components/month x 12 months/year = $554,400/year

To make a profit of $626,400 in a year, the annual revenue should be:
Annual revenue = Annual production cost + Desired profit = $554,400/year + $626,400/year = $1,180,800/year

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee this revenue, we can divide the annual revenue by the number of components produced in a year:
Minimum selling price = Annual revenue / Number of components produced in a year
Number of components produced in a year = 420 components/month x 12 months/year = 5,040 components/year
Minimum selling price = $1,180,800/year / 5,040 components/year = $234/component

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $234.

Action: Answer("None of the above") [correct answer is $234, which is not listed as a choice]
Response 6:
Let P be the price per component in dollars. 

The yearly revenue from selling 420 units per month is 12*420*P = 5040P dollars. 

The yearly production cost is 12*420*110 = 554400 dollars. 

So the yearly profit is 5040P - 554400 dollars. 

We want to find the minimum P such that the yearly profit is at least 626400 dollars. 

That is, we want to solve the inequality: 

5040P - 554400 >= 626400 

Simplifying this inequality, we get: 

5040P >= 1180800 

P >= 234 

So the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least 626400 dollars is $234. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Let's start by figuring out the yearly production cost:  

Yearly production cost = Monthly production cost * 12  
Yearly production cost = 420 * 110 * 12  
Yearly production cost = 554,400  

Now we can set up the equation for the yearly profit:  

Yearly profit = Yearly revenue - Yearly production cost  

We want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400, so we can write:  

626,400 ≤ Yearly revenue - 554,400  

Simplifying:  

Yearly revenue ≥ 1,180,800  

The company produces 420 units every month, so the yearly production is 420 * 12 = 5,040 units.  
We need to find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly revenue of at least $1,180,800.  

Minimum selling price = Yearly revenue / Yearly production  
Minimum selling price = 1,180,800 / 5,040  
Minimum selling price = 234  

The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.  

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Let the minimum selling price per component be x.
The revenue from selling one component is x, and the profit from selling one component is x - 110.
The revenue from selling 420 components is 420x, and the profit from selling 420 components is 420(x - 110) = 420x - 46,200.
The yearly profit is 12 times the monthly profit, so the yearly profit is 12(420x - 46,200) = 5,040x - 554,400.
We want this to be at least $626,400, so we solve the inequality:
5,040x - 554,400 ≥ 626,400
5,040x ≥ 1,180,800
x ≥ 234
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Let's start by finding the yearly revenue. Since the company produces 420 units per month, the yearly production is 420 x 12 = 5040 units. 

To make a profit of $626,400, the revenue should be at least $626,400 + (5040 x $110) = $1,200,000. 

Thus, the minimum selling price per component should be $1,200,000 / 5040 = $238.10. 

Rounding this up to the nearest dollar gives us a minimum selling price of $239.

m / x = (1 / (4y)) * 100 
m / x = 25/y 

Therefore, m is (25/y) * 100 percent of x, or 2500/y percent of x.

Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 240
  C: 30
  D: 60
  E: 120
Response 0:
To solve the problem, we can use the formula:
time = distance / speed

Action: Answer("E") 
The time it will take to travel 48 miles is 240 minutes or 4 hours.
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance ÷ speed. 

Action: Answer("E") 

Explanation: 
time = distance ÷ speed = 48 miles ÷ 12 miles per hour = 4 hours
We need to convert 4 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 
4 hours × 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes. 
Therefore, it will take 240 minutes to travel 48 miles at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
Response 2:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Substituting the given values, we get:

time = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour

time = 4 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:

time = 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour

time = 240 minutes

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

Action: Answer("E") 

Explanation: 

time = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour = 4 hours

We need to convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:

4 hours x 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Action: Answer("E") 

Here, distance is 48 miles and speed is 12 miles per hour. So, 

time = 48 / 12 

time = 4 hours 

But the question asks for the answer in minutes, so we need to convert 4 hours to minutes: 

time = 4 x 60 

time = 240 minutes 

Therefore, the answer is E: 120.
Response 6:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Action: Answer("E") 

The time it will take to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour is 48 / 12 = 4 hours. 

To convert hours to minutes, we can multiply by 60: 

4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes. 

Therefore, it will take 240 minutes to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour.
Response 7:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

Action: Answer("E") 

Here, distance is 48 miles and speed is 12 miles per hour. So, 

time = 48 / 12 = 4 hours

But, we need to convert hours to minutes, so 

time = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

Therefore, the answer is 240 (choice E).
Response 8:
Solution: 

We can use the formula: 

time = distance / speed

Converting 12 miles per hour to miles per minute: 

12 miles/hour = 12/60 miles/minute = 1/5 miles/minute

Using the formula: 

time = 48 miles / (1/5 miles/minute) 

time = 48 * 5 minutes

time = 240 minutes

Answer: Answer("B") - 240
Response 9:
We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. In this case, distance is 48 miles and speed is 12 miles per hour. So, time = 48 / 12 = 4 hours. But we need to convert hours to minutes, so we multiply by 60: 4 * 60 = 240.

Topic: Math
Question: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?
Choices:
  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let's first calculate the total investment made by A and B for the entire year.
A invested for 12 months, so his investment = 40000 x 12 = 480000
B invested for 10 months (since he joined after 2 months), so his investment = 60000 x 10 = 600000
Total investment = 480000 + 600000 = 1080000

Now, let's calculate the investment made by C.
Let's assume C joined after x months.
So, C invested for (12-x) months.
Total investment made by C = 120000 x (12-x) = 1440000 - 120000x

Total profit = 375000
C's share = 150000

We know that C's share of the profit is equal to his investment multiplied by the time period he invested, divided by the total investment.
So, we can write an equation as: 150000 = (1440000 - 120000x) * (12-x) / 1080000

Simplifying this equation, we get:
5/12 = (12-x)/30
12-x = 18
x = 6

Therefore, C joined after 6 months.

Question: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 62
  C: 82
  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Let's solve this problem using Math.
The sum of k consecutive integers is given by the formula k[(a_1+a_k)/2], where a_1 is the first integer and a_k is the kth integer.
Here, a_1 = -50 and the sum is 51.
So, we can write 51 = k[(-50 + a_k)/2]
Simplifying this equation, we get a_k = -49 + 2k
We know that the last integer is a_k and the first integer is -50. So, the number of integers is k = (a_k - (-50)) + 1 = (2k + 1)
Substituting k = 25.5 in this equation, we do not get an integer value for the number of integers.
Therefore, we can conclude that there is no solution for this problem.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Let's solve the problem using algebra:
The sum of k consecutive integers starting from -50 is given by: 
-50 + (-50+1) + (-50+2) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51
Simplifying the left side of the equation:
-k*50 + (1+2+...+k-1) = 51
-k*50 + k*(k-1)/2 = 51
Multiplying both sides by -2 to eliminate the fraction:
k^2 - k - 102 = 0
Solving the quadratic equation for k using the quadratic formula:
k = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*102)]/2
k = [1 ± 21]/2
k = 11 or k = -10
Since k has to be a positive integer, the answer is:
Action: Answer("A")  (k=11)
Response 2:
Here is the solution to the problem:

Let's say that the k consecutive integers start from x. Then the sum of k consecutive integers can be expressed as:
x + (x+1) + (x+2) +...+ (x+k-1) = kx + [k*(k-1)/2] 

From the problem, we know that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51 and the least integer is -50. Substituting these values into the above equation, we get:
k(-50) + [k*(k-1)/2] = 51
Simplifying this equation, we get:
k^2 - 99k - 102 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we can solve for k:
k = [99 ± sqrt(99^2 + 4*102*1)]/2
k = [99 ± sqrt(10137)]/2

Since k has to be a positive integer, we can discard the negative root. Therefore, we get:
k = [99 + sqrt(10137)]/2
k ≈ 40.97

Since k has to be an integer, the closest integer value to 40.97 is 41.

Response 6:
Let's solve this problem using algebra. 

Let x be the first integer, then the kth integer is x + k - 1. 

The sum of k consecutive integers is given by the formula: 

sum = (first integer + last integer) * number of integers / 2

Substituting the given values, we get: 

51 = (-50 + x + x + k - 1) * k / 2

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

102 = -99 + 2x + k(k-1)

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation: 

k^2 + k - 201 = 0

Solving this equation using the quadratic formula, we get: 

k = 13 or k = -14

Since k is a positive integer, we can reject the negative solution. 

Therefore, k = 13. 

Answer: Answer("None of the above") 

Note: None of the given choices matches the correct answer, which is k = 13.
Response 7:
Let's call the least integer "x". Since we know the least integer is -50, then "x" is equal to -50. 
We also know that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51. 

The sum of k consecutive integers can be represented as: 
x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1)

Substituting -50 for x, we get: 
-50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get: 
-kx + (k(k-1))/2 = 51 

Substituting -50 for x, we get: 
-50k + (k(k-1))/2 = 51 

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get: 
-100k + k(k-1) = 102 

Expanding the right side, we get: 
-100k + k^2 - k = 102 

Rearranging terms, we get: 
k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0 

This is a quadratic equation that can be factored as: 
(k-1)(k-100) = 0 

Therefore, k is either 1 or 100. Since we are looking for the number of consecutive integers, k cannot be 1. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let's solve this problem using algebra. 

If the least integer is -50, then the sum of the k consecutive integers can be expressed as:

-50 + (-50 + 1) + (-50 + 2) + ... + (-50 + k-1) 

Simplifying the expression, we get:

k(-50) + (1 + 2 + ... + k-1)

The sum of the first k-1 positive integers can be expressed as:

1 + 2 + ... + k-1 = k(k-1)/2

Substituting this expression back into the original equation, we get:

k(-50) + k(k-1)/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

2k(-50) + k(k-1) = 102

Expanding the expression, we get:

-100k + k^2 - k = 0

Simplifying the equation, we get:

k^2 - 101k = 0

Factoring out k, we get:

k(k - 101) = 0

Therefore, k = 0 or k = 101.

Since we are looking for a positive value of k, the answer is:

Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
Response 0:
Let the original side of the square be x feet. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions x-4 and x. The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x square feet. 

Cutting the rectangular piece diagonally in half creates two congruent right triangles with legs x-4 and x/2. The area of each triangle is 1/2 * base * height = 70 square feet, so we have:

1/2 * (x-4) * (x/2) = 70

Multiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying gives:

x^2 - 8x - 280 = 0

Factoring gives:

(x-20)(x+14) = 0

Since x must be positive, we have x = 20. 

Therefore, the original square piece of cloth had side length 20 feet, and its perimeter was 4x = 80 feet. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let the side of the original square piece of cloth be x. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) by x. The area of the rectangle is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. Since the rectangle is cut in half diagonally, the area of each triangle is (1/2)(x-4)(sqrt(x^2 - (x-4)^2)/2) = 70. Simplifying this expression, we get (x-4)(sqrt(x^2 - (x-4)^2)) = 280. Squaring both sides, we get (x-4)^2(x^2 - (x-4)^2) = 280^2. Expanding and simplifying, we get 2x^4 - 32x^3 + 65x^2 - 800x + 2176 = 0. Factoring out 2, we get 2(x-8)(x-4)(x^2 - 17x + 68) = 0. The quadratic factor has roots x = (17 +/- sqrt(97))/2. Since x cannot be greater than 12 (due to the 4-foot trimming), we have x = (17 - sqrt(97))/2. The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x = 4(17 - sqrt(97))/2 = 34 - 2sqrt(97). 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let the original side length of the square piece of cloth be x. 

After trimming 4 feet, the rectangular piece has dimensions x-4 and x. 

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can express the area of each triangle in terms of x: 

(1/2)(x-4)^2 + (1/2)x^2 = 70 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

x^2 - 8x + 36 = 0 

Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get: 

x = 4 + 2√31 

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x, so: 

Action: Answer("D")  62
Response 3:
Let's denote the length of the original square piece of cloth as x. Then, after trimming 4 feet from one edge, the length of the rectangular piece becomes (x-4) feet. 

The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. We know that the area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height. Since each triangle is a right triangle (due to the diagonal cut), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the base and height. Let's denote the base and height of each triangle as b and h, respectively.

From the given information, we have:

(1/2) * b * h = 70

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we also have:

b^2 + h^2 = (x-4)^2

We want to find the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth, which is 4x. We can start by expressing the perimeter in terms of b and h:

4x = b + h + (x-4)

Rearranging, we get:

b + h = 4x - (x-4) = 3x + 4

Squaring both sides of the Pythagorean theorem and substituting in the expression for b^2 + h^2, we get:

(3x+4)^2 = 2b^2 + 2h^2

Substituting in the expression for (1/2) * b * h, we get:

(3x+4)^2 = 140 * 2

Simplifying, we get:

3x+4 = 2sqrt(70)

Solving for x, we get:

x = (2sqrt(70) - 4)/3

Finally, we can calculate the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth:

4x = 4 * (2sqrt(70) - 4)/3 = (8sqrt(70) - 16)/3

Rationalizing the denominator, we get:

(8sqrt(70) - 16)/3 * (sqrt(70) + 2)/(sqrt(70) + 2) = (8*70 - 32sqrt(70) + 16)/3sqrt(70+2) = (536 - 32sqrt(70))/3

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D") 62.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let x be the length of the original square piece of cloth. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x. Since this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, each triangle has base (x-4) and height x. 

The area of each triangle is (1/2) base times height, so we have:

(1/2)(x-4)(x) = 70

Expanding and rearranging, we get:

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get:

x = 14 or x = -10

Since x represents a length, we take the positive solution x = 14. Therefore, the original square piece of cloth had side length 14 feet. 

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4 times the side length, which is 4*14 = 56 feet.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the original side of the square was "x" feet. After trimming 4 feet, the length of the rectangular piece becomes "x-4" feet while the width remains "x" feet. Therefore, the area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x square feet. 

Since the rectangular piece was cut diagonally in half to create two triangles, the area of each triangle is (x^2 - 4x)/2 square feet. We are given that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. Therefore, we can write the following equation: 

(x^2 - 4x)/2 = 70 

Solving for x, we get x = 14 or x = -10. Since the side of the square has to be positive, we take x = 14. 

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x = 56 feet. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. When the 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. When this rectangular piece is cut along the diagonal, two triangles are formed with the base and height of (x-4) and x respectively. 

The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height. We are given that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. So, 

(1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation, we get x = 14 or x = -10. Since x cannot be negative, the original side of the square piece of cloth was 14 feet. 

Therefore, the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x = 56 feet. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let the original side of the square piece of cloth be x feet. 

When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. 

The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. 

When the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, two congruent right triangles are formed. 

The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the total area of the rectangular piece is 140 square feet. 

Therefore, we have:

x^2 - 4x = 140 

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0 

(x-14)(x+10) = 0 

x = 14 (since x cannot be negative) 

So the original square piece of cloth had a side length of 14 feet. 

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4 times the side length, which is:

4(14) = 56 

Therefore, the answer is (A) 56.

Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:
  A: 46
  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
We can begin by using the information given to write two equations. Let L be the length of the rectangle and W be the width. Since the unpainted side has length 9, we know that either L or W is 9. Without loss of generality, assume that W=9. Then the sum of the painted sides is L+2W=37, which simplifies to L+18=37, or L=19. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is LW=9*19=171 square feet.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
We can start by using the given information to set up equations. Let's call the length of the painted sides x and y (where x is the length of the side parallel to the unpainted side). 

From the problem, we know that:

x + y + 9 = 37  (the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37)
x + y = 28 

We also know that the area of a rectangle is given by A = lw, where l is the length and w is the width. In this case, the width is 9 feet, and the length is the sum of the lengths of the painted sides (x + y). So:

A = (x + y)(9)

We can substitute the equation x + y = 28 into the equation for A to get:

A = (28)(9) = 252

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 252 square feet.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
We can start by using the information given in the problem to set up some equations. Let's call the length of the painted sides L and W (with L being the longer side), and let's call the area of the parking space A. 

From the problem statement, we know that: 

W + L + W = 37 

This simplifies to: 

2W + L = 37 

We also know that the length of the unpainted side is 9, so: 

L = 9 + W 

We can substitute this expression for L into the previous equation: 

2W + (9 + W) = 37 

Simplifying: 

3W + 9 = 37 

3W = 28 

W = 9.33 (rounded to two decimal places) 

Now that we know the width of the parking space, we can use the expression we derived earlier for L: 

L = 9 + W = 18.33 

Finally, we can find the area of the parking space: 

A = L x W = 9.33 x 18.33 = 170.56 (rounded to two decimal places) 

So the answer is approximately 170.56 square feet. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let the length of the painted sides be L and W. Then we can write two equations based on the information given:

2L + W = 37 (since the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet)
L + W = 28 (since the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet)

Solving for L and W, we get L = 19 and W = 9. Therefore, the area of the parking space is L * W = 19 * 9 = 171 square feet.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
To solve the problem, let's start by using the given information to set up an equation. Let L be the length of the parking space and W be the width. We know that the unpainted side has length 9, so we have:

2L + W = 37 (sum of the lengths of the painted sides)
W = 9 (length of the unpainted side)

We can solve for L by substituting W = 9 into the first equation and solving for L:

2L + 9 = 37
2L = 28
L = 14

Therefore, the length of the parking space is 14 feet and the width is 9 feet. The area of the parking space is:

A = L * W = 14 * 9 = 126

So the answer is (C) 126. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the width of the rectangle is "w" and the length is "l". We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so we have:

2w + l = 37 (sum of the lengths of the painted sides)
l = 37 - 2w (solve for l)

We also know that the area of a rectangle is given by:

A = lw

Substituting the expression for "l" in terms of "w" into the formula for the area, we get:

A = w(37 - 2w)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

A = 37w - 2w^2

To find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to w and set it equal to zero:

dA/dw = 37 - 4w = 0

Solving for "w", we get:

w = 37/4

Substituting this value of "w" back into the expression for the area, we get:

A = 37(37/4) - 2(37/4)^2 = 126.125

Therefore, the answer is approximately 126 square feet.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
We are given that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. Let's assume that this is the width of the rectangle. 

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by L. 

We are also given that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Since there are three painted sides, the sum of two lengths is L + 2W. 

But we know that L + 2W = 37 - 9 = 28. 

We can now solve for L: 

L + 2W = 28 

L + 2(9) = 28 

L + 18 = 28 

L = 10 

So the length of the rectangle is 10 feet, and the width is 9 feet. 

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is L × W = 10 × 9 = 90 square feet. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
We can start by using the information given to find the length and width of the parking space. Let the length be L and the width be W. Then we have:

2L + W = 37 (the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet)
W = 9 (the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet)

Substituting W = 9 into the first equation, we get:

2L + 9 = 37
2L = 28
L = 14

So the length of the parking space is 14 feet and the width is 9 feet. Therefore, the area of the parking space is:

A = L * W = 14 * 9 = 126

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let the length of the painted side be x and the width be y.
The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so we have x + 2y = 37 and y = (37 - x)/2.
The area of the rectangle is A = xy = x(37 - x)/2 = (37x - x^2)/2.
To maximize the area, we take the derivative of A with respect to x and set it equal to 0:
dA/dx = 37/2 - x = 0
x = 37/2
Substituting this value of x into the area equation, we get:
A = (37(37/2) - (37/2)^2)/2 = 126.125
Therefore, the answer is approximately 126, which is closest to choice C. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's call the length of the parking space L and the width W. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so we can set up the equation:

2L + W = 37

We also know that the area of a rectangle is A = LW. We can solve for W in the first equation:

W = 37 - 2L

We can substitute this into the equation for area:

A = L(37 - 2L)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

A = 37L - 2L^2

To maximize the area, we want to find the value of L that makes A as large as possible. We can do this by finding the vertex of the parabola defined by the equation for A. The x-coordinate of the vertex is:

L = -b/2a

where a = -2 and b = 37. Plugging in these values, we get:

L = -37/(2*(-2)) = 9.25

Since L is the length, we know that W = 37 - 2L = 18.5. Therefore, the area is:

A = LW = 9.25 * 18.5 = 170.125

So the answer is closest to Choice C: 126.

Question: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?

  D: 6
  E: 3
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Let's assume that the rate at which hose A can fill the pool is a, and the rate at which hose B can fill the pool is b. We can solve for a and b using the given information:

- In the first 2 hours, hose A filled 2a units of the pool (since it can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, it can fill 1/8 of the pool in 1 hour, so it can fill 2/8 or 1/4 of the pool in 2 hours).
- In the next 3 hours, both hoses working together filled 3(a+b) units of the pool (since they finished filling the pool in these 3 hours, they filled the remaining 3/4 of the pool in this time).
- Since the entire pool is 1 unit, we can write the following equation: 2a + 3(a+b) = 1
- Simplifying this equation, we get: 5a + 3b = 1

We need to find how long it would take hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool. Let's call this time t. Then we can write:

- Hose B can fill 1/t of the pool in 1 hour, so it can fill (3/4) of the pool in (3/4)t hours.
- Since both hoses working together can fill (3/4) of the pool in 3 hours, their combined rate is (3/4)/3 = 1/4 of the pool per hour.
- We can write another equation using the combined rate: a + b = 1/4

Now we have two equations with two unknowns (a and b):

5a + 3b = 1
a + b = 1/4

Solving for a in the second equation, we get: a = 1/4 - b

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

5(1/4 - b) + 3b = 1
5/4 - 2b + 3b = 1
b = 1/4

So hose B can fill the entire pool in 4 hours, which is answer choice D. Therefore, the action is Answer("D").

Question: Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is?
Choices:
  A: 21
  B: 33
  C: 35
  D: 42
  E: 58
Response 0:
Let the original numbers be 3x and 5x. Then, (3x - 9) and (5x - 9) are the new numbers.
We are given that (3x - 9) : (5x - 9) = 12 : 23
Cross-multiplying, we get 23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)
Expanding and simplifying, we get 9x = 207
Therefore, x = 23
So, the smaller number (3x) is 69.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let the two numbers in the ratio 3:5 be 3x and 5x.
After subtracting 9 from each, the new ratio becomes 12:23.
So, (3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23
Solving this equation, we get x = 69/46
Therefore, the smaller number (3x - 9) is 3(69/46) - 9 = 6.5 (approx).
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") [The closest answer is A: 21, but it is not correct.]
Response 2:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, we get 3x-9 and 5x-9. We know that (3x-9)/(5x-9)=12/23.
Cross-multiplying, we get 69x - 207 = 60x - 108. Solving for x, we get x=9.
Therefore, the smaller number is 3x-9 = 18.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9. We are given that (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. 

Solving this equation, we get x = 69/4. 

So the smaller number is 3x = 207/4, which is approximately 51.75. 

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("None of the above") - the closest option is D: 42.
Response 4:
Let the two numbers in the ratio 3:5 be 3x and 5x respectively.
After subtracting 9 from each, the new ratio becomes 12:23, so the new numbers are 12y and 23y respectively.
We can write two equations based on the given information:
3x - 9 = 12y
5x - 9 = 23y
From the first equation, we get:
y = (3x - 9) / 12 = (x - 3) / 4
Substituting this value of y into the second equation, we get:
5x - 9 = 23 * (x - 3) / 4
Solving for x, we get:
x = 33
Therefore, the smaller number (3x) is:
3x = 3 * 33 = 99
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x.
After subtracting 9 from each, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9.
According to the problem, (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23.
Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get 69x = 207.
So, x = 3.
Therefore, the smaller number is 3*3 = 9.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let the two numbers in the ratio 3:5 be 3x and 5x respectively.
When 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio becomes 12:23. This means that the new numbers are 12y and 23y respectively.
So, we have:
3x - 9 = 12y  ...(1)
5x - 9 = 23y  ...(2)

We need to find the value of 3x.

Multiplying equation (1) by 23 and equation (2) by 12, we get:
69x - 207 = 276y
60x - 108 = 276y

Equating both equations to eliminate 'y', we get:
69x - 207 = 60x - 108
9x = 99
x = 11

So, the smaller number is 3x = 3 * 11 = 33.

Hence, the answer is Action: Answer("B")  i.e. 33.
Response 7:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9, respectively. We know that (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Cross-multiplying, we get 69x = 207, and so x = 3. Therefore, the smaller number is 3x-9 = 6.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")  (since none of the given choices is correct)
Response 8:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. Then, (3x-9) and (5x-9) are the new numbers.
From the problem, we know that (3x-9)/(5x-9)=12/23

Therefore, the smaller number is 3x=207

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let the original numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, we get (3x-9) and (5x-9). We are given that (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Cross multiplying we get 23(3x-9) = 12(5x-9), which simplifies to 69x - 207 = 60x - 108. Solving for x, we get x = 9. Therefore, the smaller number is 3x - 9 = 3(9) - 9 = 18.

To solve this problem, we can use the fact that if one of the roots of a quadratic equation is known, then the sum and product of the roots can be used to find the other root and the coefficients of the quadratic equation. 

Let's use r as the other root. Then, we know that:

- The sum of the roots is -m/1 = -m
- The product of the roots is 1.5r = 22/r

We can solve for r by multiplying these two equations:

- (-m) * 1.5r = -m * 22/r
- -2.25mr = -22m
- r = 22/2.25 = 44/9

Now that we know both roots, we can use them to find the value of m:

- 1.5 + 44/9 = m/1
- 27/6 + 44/9 = m
- 9/2 + 44/9 = m
- 81/18 + 88/18 = m

Question: On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is:
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 11
  C: 12
  D: 13
  E: 14
Response 0:
First, we need to find the HCF of the given numbers 2272 and 875: 

2272 = 875 x 2 + 522
875 = 522 x 1 + 353
522 = 353 x 1 + 169
353 = 169 x 2 + 15
169 = 15 x 11 + 4
15 = 4 x 3 + 3
4 = 3 x 1 + 1

Hence, HCF (2272, 875) = 1

Now, we need to find a 3-digit number that leaves a remainder of 1 when dividing both 2272 and 875. 

Let's try dividing 2272 by 100+1 = 101:
2272 ÷ 101 = 22 remainder 50

Let's try dividing 875 by 101:
875 ÷ 101 = 8 remainder 67

Since both 2272 and 875 leave the same remainder 50 when divided by 101, we can assume that the 3-digit number N = 101.

Question: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 8
  C: 22
  D: 50
  E: 20
Response 0:
Let's assume that the entire work is equivalent to 12 units (LCM of 3 and 4).
Since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, he can clean 1 unit of the yacht in 1 hour.
Thus, Jack can clean 12/12 = 1 unit of the yacht in 1 hour.
On a particular day, Jack cleans 2/3 of the yacht. Therefore, he cleans 2/3 x 12 = 8 units of the yacht.
The remaining work is 12 - 8 = 4 units of the yacht.
Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do. Thus, Jill can clean 5/100 x 1 = 1/20 unit of the yacht in 1 hour.
Therefore, Jill can clean 4 units of the yacht in 4/(1/20) = 80 hours.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's first find out how long Jack would take to clean the yacht by himself. If he can clean a yacht in 12 hours, then in 1 hour he can clean 1/12 of the yacht. 

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he has one-third of the work left. 

Let's represent the remaining work by R. So, R = 1/3 of the yacht.

Jack can clean 1/12 of the yacht in 1 hour. So, he can clean R in:

R = (1/12) * t
t = 12R

Jack worked for some time and finished two-thirds of the work. So, he had cleaned:

(2/3) * Y

Jill cleaned the remaining work. She can clean the yacht at 5% of Jack's rate. So, in 1 hour, she can clean 5/100 * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht.

Let's represent the time taken by Jill to clean the remaining work by t2. So, we can write:

(1/3) * Y = (1/240) * t2

t2 = (1/3) * Y * 240

t2 = 80

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the entire job is to clean 1 yacht.
Jack can clean 1 yacht in 12 hours, so he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in 1 hour.
On a particular day, Jack finished two-thirds of the work, which means he cleaned (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 of the yacht.
The remaining portion of the work is 1 - (2/3) = 1/3 of the yacht.
Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means Jill can clean 5/100 * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht in 1 hour.
To clean 1/3 of the yacht, Jill needs (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let's first find out how long it takes Jack to clean the whole yacht. If he can clean it in 12 hours, then in one hour, he can clean 1/12 of the yacht. 

Since Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, the remaining one-third of the work is done by Jill. Let's call the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work "t". 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. This means in one hour, Jill can clean 1/20 of what Jack can clean in one hour. 

Using this information, we can set up the equation: 

(1/3) = (1/20)t

Solving for "t", we get: 

t = 20

Therefore, Jill takes 20 hours to finish the remaining work.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let's assume that the whole yacht cleaning job is represented by the variable "J". Therefore, Jack can clean the yacht at the rate of 1/12J per hour. 

On the particular day, Jack finished two-thirds of the job. Therefore, the remaining work is 1/3J. 

Jill's cleaning rate is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, Jill can clean at the rate of 1/20(1/12J) per hour. 

Let's assume that Jill took "h" hours to finish the remaining work. Therefore, 

(1/20)(1/12J)h = 1/3J

Solving for "h", we get:

h = 22.5

Therefore, it will take Jill 22.5 hours to finish the remaining work.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let the total work be 1 unit. 
On a particular day, Jack finished two-thirds of the work, which means he did (2/3) of 1 unit of work = 2/3 unit of work.
So, the remaining work is (1-2/3) = 1/3 unit of work.
Let the time taken by Jill to complete this remaining work be 't' hours.
Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, which means he can clean 1/12 unit of work in 1 hour.
Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of Jack's rate, which means Jill can clean only 5/100 or 1/20 of what Jack can do in an hour.
Using the above information, we can form an equation:
(1/12)*(2/3) + (1/20)*t = 1/3
Simplifying the equation, we get:
t = 22.5 hours
Therefore, the answer is 22.5, which is closest to option C. Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's start by finding out how long it takes for Jack to clean the whole yacht. If he can clean a yacht in 12 hours, then he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in 1 hour. 

Since Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, the remaining one-third of the work is done by Jill. Let's assume that it takes Jill x hours to clean the remaining one-third of the yacht. 

If Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, then her rate is 0.05/1 = 1/20 of Jack's rate. 

We can set up an equation to relate the rates of Jack and Jill: 

Rate of Jack + Rate of Jill = Combined Rate

1/12 + 1/x = 1/[(2/3)*12]

Simplifying the equation: 

1/12 + 1/x = 1/8

Multiplying both sides by 24x: 

2x + 24 = 3x 

x = 24 hours 

Therefore, it takes Jill 24 hours to clean the remaining one-third of the yacht. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's denote the entire work as W. We know Jack can clean the entire work W in 12 hours. Therefore, his rate of cleaning is W/12.

On a particular day, Jack finished two-thirds of the work. Therefore, he finished (2/3)W work in the given day. The remaining work is (1/3)W.

As Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate, her rate is (5/100) * (W/12) = W/240.

Let's denote the time Jill would take to complete the remaining work as t. Therefore, Jill would have completed the remaining work (W/240) * t.

Since the total work is W, the equation becomes:

(2/3)W + (W/240) * t = W

Simplifying the equation, we get:

t = (22/3) hours

Therefore, it would take Jill 22/3 hours to complete the remaining work.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's first find out how long it would take Jack to finish the entire job.

If he can finish the job in 12 hours, then in 1 hour he can finish 1/12 of the job.

Let's say the entire job is represented by the number 1.

If Jack finishes two-thirds of the job, then he finishes (2/3) of the job.

That means the remaining portion of the job is (1/3).

Now, let's find out how long it would take Jill to finish (1/3) of the job.

Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate. That means in 1 hour, she can finish 5% of what Jack can do.

In other words, in 1 hour, she can finish (5/100) of the job.

We want to find out how long it would take her to finish (1/3) of the job.

Let's call the number of hours it would take her "x".

So we can set up the equation: (5/100) * x = (1/3)

Simplifying this equation, we get: x = (1/3) / (5/100) = 20

Therefore, it would take Jill 20 hours to finish the remaining portion of the job.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Let's assume that the entire work can be completed in 12 hours when Jack is working alone. Therefore, if Jack can complete the work in 12 hours, then his work rate is 1 yacht per 12 hours, which is equal to 1/12 of the work per hour. On a particular day, Jack finished 2/3 of the work, which means he completed 2/3 x (1 yacht) = 2/3 yacht of the work. Therefore, the remaining portion of the work is 1/3 yacht. 

Let's now calculate Jill's work rate. We are told that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, Jill's work rate is 5/100 x (1/12) = 1/240 of the work per hour. 

To find how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we can use the formula: 

time = work ÷ rate 

Substituting the values we have: 

time = (1/3) ÷ (1/240) 

time = 80/3 

time ≈ 26.67 

Therefore, it takes Jill approximately 26.67 hours to finish the remaining work.

0.20x = 3.40
x = 17

Since x must be a whole number, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is 17.

Question: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.
Choices:
  A: 368
  B: 377
  C: 288
  D: 997
  E: 112
Response 0:
Let the three-digit number be $abc$. Then we have the equations $a+b+c=17$, $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$, and $100a+10b+c-495=100c+10b+a$. Simplifying, we get $99a-99c=595$, or $a-c=5$. We can also rewrite the first two equations as $a=17-b-c$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. Substituting the first equation into the second, we have $(17-b-c)^2+b^2+c^2=109$, or $2b^2+2c^2+2bc-34b-34c+120=0$. We can then use the quadratic formula to solve for $b$ and $c$ in terms of the other variable, and we get that $b+c=17\pm\sqrt{109}$. Since $a-c=5$, we know that $a$ and $c$ have the same units digit. Therefore, $b$ must also have that units digit. This narrows down our choices to $\textbf{(A)} 368$ and $\textbf{(B)} 377$. Checking, we find that $\textbf{(B)}$ is the correct answer, since $773-495=278$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let the hundreds, tens, and units digits be a, b, and c respectively.

From the first equation, we know that:

a + b + c = 17

From the second equation, we know that:

a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109

We can also express the original three-digit number as 100a + 10b + c, and the reversed number as 100c + 10b + a. 

If we subtract 495 from the original number, we get:

100a + 10b + c - 495

We want this to be equal to the reversed number, which is:

100c + 10b + a

So we can write the equation:

100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a

Simplifying this equation, we get:

99a - 99c = 495

Dividing both sides by 99, we get:

a - c = 5

Now we have three equations and three unknowns:

a + b + c = 17
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
a - c = 5

We can use the third equation to substitute for a in the first two equations:

c + b + (a - 5) = 17
(a - 5)^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109

Simplifying the first equation, we get:

a + b + c = 22

Substituting a = c + 5, we get:

c + 5 + b + c = 22

2c + b = 17

Substituting a = c + 5 in the second equation, we get:

(c + 5)^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109

Simplifying, we get:

2c^2 + 10c + b^2 + 25 = 109

2c^2 + 10c + b^2 = 84

We can substitute 17 - 2c for b in this equation (from 2c + b = 17):

2c^2 + 10c + (17 - 2c)^2 = 84

Simplifying, we get:

5c^2 - 34c + 25 = 0

This quadratic equation factors as:

(5c - 5)(c - 5) = 0

So c = 1 or c = 5. If c = 1, then b = 15 - a, which is impossible since a, b, and c must be digits between 0 and 9. Therefore, c = 5, and we can substitute this into 2c + b = 17 to get b = 7. Finally, we can substitute a = c + 5 = 10 into the original three-digit number to get:

100a + 10b + c = 1000

The answer is:

Action: Answer("A")  368
Response 2:
Let's assume that the hundreds, tens and units digits are a, b and c respectively. 

From the first condition, we have a + b + c = 17. 

From the second condition, we have a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109. 

From the third condition, we have 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a. 

Simplifying this equation, we get 99a - 99c = 495, which gives us a - c = 5. 

We can use the first and third conditions to get a + c = 12. 

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get a = 8, b = 1, and c = 3. 

Therefore, the number is 813. 

Now we can check if this number satisfies all three conditions: 
- The sum of the digits is 8 + 1 + 3 = 12, which is correct. 
- The sum of the squares of the digits is 8^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 = 64 + 1 + 9 = 74, which is not correct. 
- If we subtract 495 from 813, we get 318, which is not the same as 3, 1, and 8 written in reverse order. 

Therefore, none of the given choices is correct.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let the number be abc. Then the problem yields the following system of equations:
a + b + c = 17  (Equation 1)
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109  (Equation 2)
100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a  (Equation 3)
Simplifying Equation 3, we get:
99a - 99c = 495
a - c = 5  (Equation 4)
Adding Equation 1 and Equation 4, we get:
2a + b = 22
Subtracting Equation 2 from twice Equation 1, we get:
a^2 - 2ab + b^2 + a^2 - 2ac + c^2 = 34
2a^2 - 2a(b + c) + b^2 + c^2 = 34
2a^2 - 2a(17 - a) + b^2 + c^2 = 34
4a^2 - 34a + 2b^2 + 2c^2 = 68
2a^2 - 17a + b^2 + c^2 = 34  (Equation 5)
We know that a - c = 5. Therefore, we can express c in terms of a as follows:
c = a - 5
Substituting this in Equation 5, we get:
2a^2 - 17a + (a - 5)^2 + b^2 = 34
2a^2 - 17a + a^2 - 10a + 25 + b^2 = 34
3a^2 - 27a + b^2 - 9 = 0
3(a - 3)(a - 3) + b^2 - 9 = 0
3(a - 3)^2 + b^2 = 18
(a - 3)^2 + (b^2 / 3) = 6
Since (a - 3)^2 is a perfect square, we know that (b^2 / 3) is also a perfect square. Therefore, b must be a multiple of 3. The only possible values of b are 2, 5, and 8. However, we can use Equation 1 to eliminate 2 and 5 as possibilities, leaving us with b = 8. Substituting this in Equation 1, we get a = 6. Substituting a and b in Equation 2, we get c = 3. Therefore, the number is 683, and when we subtract 495 from it, we get 188, which is indeed the reverse of 683. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let's assume the hundreds, tens, and units digits of the number are a, b, and c respectively. Then, we have the following information:
a + b + c = 17
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109

We are also told that if we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number with the same digits in reverse order. This means that:
100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
99a - 99c = 495
a - c = 5

Now we have a system of equations to solve:
a + b + c = 17
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
a - c = 5

We can solve for a and c using the third equation:
a = c + 5

Substituting this into the first equation gives:
2c + 5 + b = 17
2c + b = 12

We can now try different values of c and b that satisfy this equation and the second equation (which gives us a unique value for b once we know c). We find that c = 2 and b = 3 satisfy both equations. This gives us:
a = c + 5 = 7

Therefore, the number is 723, and if we subtract 495 from it, we get 228, which has the same digits in reverse order. So the answer is (C) 288.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A") 

The given conditions imply that the number can be written in the form $100a + 10b + c$ where $a + b + c = 17$ and $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109$. We also know that $(100a + 10b + c) - 495 = 100c + 10b + a$. Simplifying, we get that $99a - 199c = 495$ or $a - 2c = 5$. We can now substitute $a = 5 + 2c$ into the expression for $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ to get $5c^2 + 20b + 29 = 109$ or $5c^2 + 20b - 80 = 0$. This implies that $c^2 + 4b - 16 = 0$. Checking all the possible values of $b$, we find that $b = 6$ and $c = 2$. Therefore, the number is $100a + 10b + c = 368$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
We can approach this problem using algebra. Let the hundreds, tens, and units digits of the number be represented by a, b, and c respectively. Then the number can be expressed as 100a + 10b + c. 

We know that a + b + c = 17 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109. 

We can also set up an equation based on the information about the reversed number: 

100c + 10b + a - 495 = 100a + 10b + c 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

99c - 99a = 495 

Dividing by 99: 

c - a = 5 

We can now use the equation c - a = 5 to solve for possible values of c and a. 

If c = 9, then a = 4. If c = 8, then a = 3. If c = 7, then a = 2. If c = 6, then a = 1. 

We can plug in these values for c and a into the equation a + b + c = 17 to solve for b. 

If c = 9 and a = 4, then b = 4. However, this does not satisfy the equation a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109. 

If c = 8 and a = 3, then b = 6. This does satisfy both equations. 

Therefore, the number is 386. Checking, we can see that 386 - 495 = -109, which is the reversed order of 683.

Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Solution: 

Let the cost price of the article be x.

Profit = 20% of x = 0.2x

Selling price = Cost price + Profit = x + 0.2x = 1.2x

Given, Selling price = Rs.360

So, 1.2x = 360

Dividing both sides by 1.2, we get:

x = 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Let CP be the cost price of the article.
Selling price of the article = CP + Profit
Profit = 20% of CP = (20/100)*CP = 0.2*CP
Selling price = CP + 0.2*CP = 1.2*CP
Given, Selling price = Rs.360
So, 1.2*CP = 360
CP = 360/1.2 = 300
Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Solution:
Let the cost price of the article be x.
Selling price of the article = Cost price of the article + Profit
Selling price of the article = x + 20% of x = 1.2x
Given, Selling price of the article = Rs. 360
Therefore, 1.2x = 360
x = 300

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Let the cost price of the article be x.
The selling price of the article is 360.
Profit = Selling price - Cost price = 360 - x
Profit percent = (Profit / Cost price) × 100
Given, Profit percent = 20%
Therefore, (Profit / Cost price) × 100 = 20
Profit / Cost price = 20 / 100 = 1 / 5
Profit = Cost price / 5
Substituting Profit = 360 - x in the above equation, we get
360 - x = x / 5
Multiplying both sides with 5, we get
1800 - 5x = x
6x = 1800
x = 300
Hence, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
Choices:
  A: 144km
  B: 72 km
  C: 126km
  D: 84 km
  E: 48km
Response 0:
Let's call the distance between X and Y as "d". 

When they first meet, let's say they meet at point "M". At this point, they have travelled a total distance of "d".

Let's say Allen takes "t" hours to reach point M. We know that Bob takes the same amount of time to reach point M since they both started at the same time. So, Bob has travelled 78t km and Allen has travelled 54t km.

When they meet for the second time, they would have travelled a total of "2d" distance. 

Let's say they meet at point "N" this time. At this point, we know that Bob has travelled 48 km more than Allen. So, let's say Bob has travelled "x" km from point M to point N. This means that Allen has travelled "x - 48" km from point M to point N. 

We can set up an equation based on the distances travelled:

x + (d - x) + (d - x) = 2d
78x + 54(d - x - 48) = 2d

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

78x + 54d - 54x - 2592 = 2d
24x = 1536 - 52d
x = 64 - (13/6)d

Substituting this value of "x" in the first equation, we get:

64 - (13/6)d + (d - (64 - (13/6)d)) + (d - (64 - (13/6)d)) = 2d
13d/3 = 192
d = 144 km

Therefore, the answer is A: 144 km.
Response 1:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km.
Let the time taken by Allen to reach Y be t1 hours.
Let the time taken by Bob to reach X be t2 hours.
At the time of their second meeting, Allen would have traveled a distance of (2d-48) km and Bob would have traveled a distance of (d+48) km.

We know that 
distance = speed x time

Therefore, 
d = 54t1
d = 78t2

Also, 
2d - 48 = 54t1 + 78t2
d + 48 = 78t2 + 54(t2 - t1)

Substituting d in terms of t1 and t2 in the second equation, we get:
54t1 + 48 = 24t2

Multiplying the first equation by 2 and substituting d in terms of t1 in the resulting equation, we get:
108t1 = 78t2

Substituting this value of 78t2 in the equation 54t1 + 48 = 24t2, we get:
54t1 + 48 = 36t1

Therefore, t1 = 1.2 hours and t2 = 1.67 hours

Substituting these values in the equation d = 54t1, we get:
d = 64.8 km

Action: Answer("A")  # distance between X and Y is 64.8 km, which is closest to option A (144km)
Response 2:
Let's assume that the distance between X and Y is d km. 
Let's also assume that they meet for the second time at a distance of x km from X. 

When they first meet, Allen has traveled (d/2) km and Bob has also traveled (d/2) km. 
Let t1 be the time taken to reach the first meeting point. 
Then we have: 
d/2 = 54t1  (since Allen travels at 54 kmph)
d/2 = 78t1  (since Bob travels at 78 kmph)

Adding the above two equations, we get:
t1 = d/216  (in hours)

When they meet for the second time, Allen has traveled (d-x+d) km and Bob has traveled (x+48+x) km. 
Let t2 be the time taken to reach the second meeting point. 
Then we have:
2d-x = 54t2  (since Allen travels at 54 kmph)
2x+48 = 78t2  (since Bob travels at 78 kmph)

Multiplying the above equation by 27/26 and adding the two equations, we get:
2d+72 = 2106/13 t2
Therefore, t2 = 26/63 (2d+72)

Substituting the value of t2 in the equation 2d-x = 54t2, we get:
2d-x = 54(26/63)(2d+72)
Solving the above equation, we get:
d = 126 km

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C") 126km.
Response 3:
Let the distance between X and Y be d.
Let the time taken for Allen to reach Y be t.
Let the time taken for Bob to reach X be t1.

Since the distance covered by both is the same, we have:
Allen's distance = d/2
Bob's distance = d/2

Hence, we have:
d/2 = 54t   ...(1)
d/2 + 48 = 78t1   ...(2)

Also, we know that the total distance covered by Allen is d and his speed is 54 kmph. Hence, the total time taken by Allen is given by:
d/54

Similarly, the total time taken by Bob is given by:
d/78

Now, let us consider the time taken for the second meet. At this point, Allen has traveled a distance of d/2 + 48 km and Bob has traveled a distance of d/2 - 48 km.
Hence, we have:
d/2 + 48 = 54 * (d/54 + t2)   ...(3)
d/2 - 48 = 78 * (d/78 + t2)   ...(4)

Solving equations (1) and (2), we get:
t = d/(2*54) = d/108
t1 = (d/2 + 48)/78

Substituting these values in equations (3) and (4), we get:
d/2 + 48 = 54 + d/2 + 54t2
d/2 - 48 = 78 + d/2 + 78t2

Solving these equations, we get t2 = 1/6.

Substituting this value in equation (1), we get:
d/2 = 54t = 54(d/108) = d/2
d = 108 km

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 108 km.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")  
The distance between X and Y is 144 km.
Response 6:
Let the distance between X and Y be d.
Let the time taken by Allen to meet Bob for the second time be t.
Distance covered by Allen in time t = 54t
Distance covered by Bob in time t = (78*t) + 48 (as Bob covers 48 km more than Allen)
Total distance covered by both of them = d
Therefore, we can form the equation: 54t + 78t + 48 = d
Simplifying, we get: 132t + 48 = d
We also know that Allen covers the distance d twice. Therefore, distance covered by Allen = 2d
Time taken by Allen to cover distance d = d/54
In the same time, Bob covers (d+48) km
Time taken by Bob to cover distance (d+48) = (d+48)/78
Total time taken by both of them = d/54 + (d+48)/78
As they meet for the second time, we can form the equation: (d/54) + (d+48)/78 = t
Substituting the value of t in the equation we formed earlier, we get:
132t + 48 = 132 * [(d/54) + (d+48)/78]
Simplifying, we get: d = 126 km
Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 126 km.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's say the distance between X and Y is d km. 

When they meet for the first time, let's say they have both traveled x km. 
Allen's speed is 54 kmph so the time he has taken is x/54. 
Bob's speed is 78 kmph so the time he has taken is x/78. 
Since they started at the same time, x/54 = x/78. 
Solving for x, we get x = 702/11 km. 

When they meet for the second time, they have both traveled d - x km. 
Allen's total distance traveled is x + (d - x) + (d - x) = 2d. 
Bob's total distance traveled is (d - x) + (d - x) + 48 = 2d + 48. 
Since they traveled for the same amount of time, we can set up the following equation: 

2d/54 = (2d + 48)/78 

Solving for d, we get d = 126 km. 

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C") 126km.
Response 8:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km.
Let T be the time taken (in hours) for Allen and Bob to meet for the first time.
Then, we have the following equation:
54T + 78T = d
132T = d

Let T1 be the time taken (in hours) for Allen and Bob to meet for the second time.
Then, we have the following equation:
54T1 + 78T1 + 54T1 = d + 48
186T1 = d + 48

Substituting d = 132T in the second equation, we get:
186T1 = 132T + 48
T1 = (132/186) + (48/186)
T1 = (22/31) hours

Substituting T1 in the equation 132T = d, we get:
d = 132 * (22/31)
d = 93.55 km

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is approximately 93.55 km.

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
Response 0:
Solution:
Let the distance travelled by the jeep be "d" km
Let the speed of the jeep be "s" km/hr
Given, time taken for forward journey = 6 hours
Therefore, d = 6s
Given, time taken for return journey = 4 hours
Speed during return journey = s+12 km/hr
Therefore, d = 4(s+12)
Equating the above two equations, we get
6s = 4(s+12)
Solving the above equation, we get s = 18 km/hr
Substituting s = 18 km/hr in d = 6s, we get
d = 108 km
Hence, the distance travelled by the jeep is 108km.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let's use the formula `distance = speed x time`. 

Let `d` be the distance travelled by the jeep, and `s` be the speed of the jeep in the forward journey. 

From the first part of the problem, we know that `d = s x 6`. 

From the second part of the problem, we know that the speed of the jeep in the return journey is `s + 12`, and the time taken is 4 hours. So, `d = (s + 12) x 4`. 

Equating the two expressions for `d`, we get:

`s x 6 = (s + 12) x 4`

Simplifying this equation, we get:

`2s = 24`

`s = 12`

Substituting this value of `s` in either of the expressions for `d`, we get:

`d = 12 x 6 = 72`

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 72km.

Action: Answer("None of the above")  (because the answer is not among the choices)
Response 2:
Let the distance travelled be 'd' km and the speed of the jeep be 's' km/hr. 

During the forward journey, 

distance = speed x time 

d = 6s  ---(1)

During the return journey, 

d = (s+12) x 4  ---(2)

Solving equations (1) and (2), we get:

s = 36 km/hr and d = 216 km.

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 216 km.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Solution:
Let the distance travelled by the jeep be 'd' km
Let the speed of the jeep be 's' km/hr
According to the problem,
During the forward journey, time taken = 6 hours
Therefore, d = 6s  ---(1)
During the return journey, speed of the jeep = (s+12) km/hr
Time taken = 4 hours
Therefore, d = 4(s+12)  ---(2)
From equations (1) and (2), we get
6s = 4(s+12)
Solving the above equation, we get
s = 24
Substituting the value of s in equation (1), we get
d = 6s = 6*24 = 144 km

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is 'd' km.

Let the speed of the jeep in the forward journey be 's' km/hr.

According to the problem, 

Speed = Distance/Time

Therefore, 

s = d/6

During the return journey, the speed of the jeep increased by 12km/hr. Therefore, 

Speed during the return journey = s + 12 = (d/6) + 12

Again, 

Speed = Distance/Time

Therefore, 

(d/6) + 12 = d/4

Solving for 'd', we get:

d = 144km

Hence, the jeep travelled a distance of 144km.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Solution: Let the distance be "d" and the speed of the jeep be "s". Then we have two equations: 

d = 6s     (since it took 6 hours in the forward journey)
d = 4(s+12)   (since it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours in the return journey)

Solving these equations, we get:

6s = 4(s+12)
6s = 4s + 48
2s = 48
s = 24

Substituting this value of s in any of the above equations, we get:

d = 6s = 6(24) = 144

Therefore, the jeep travelled a distance of 144km.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Let's assume that the initial speed of the jeep is 's'. Then, the distance it travelled is 'd'. 

During the forward journey, the time taken is 6 hours. Therefore, 

d = 6s  ----(1)

During the return journey, the speed of the jeep increased by 12 km/hr, so the new speed is 's+12'. The time taken during the return journey is 4 hours. Therefore, 

d = 4(s+12)  ----(2)

From equation (1) and (2), we can get the value of 'd'.

6s = 4(s+12)

6s = 4s + 48

2s = 48

s = 24 km/hr

Now, using equation (1),

d = 6s

d = 6 x 24

d = 144 km

Therefore, the jeep travelled a distance of 144 km.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Solution: 

Let's assume that the jeep's speed on the forward journey is 'x' km/hr. 

Then, the distance travelled in the forward journey = x × 6 = 6x km 

During the return journey, the jeep's speed increased by 12 km/hr. So, the speed of the jeep in the return journey = (x+12) km/hr. 

Hence, the distance travelled in the return journey = (x+12) × 4 = 4x + 48 km 

Since the distance travelled in the forward journey is the same as the distance travelled in the return journey, 

6x = 4x + 48 

Solving this equation, we get 

x = 24 km/hr 

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep in the forward journey = 6x = 6 × 24 = 144 km. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Solution:
Let the distance travelled by the jeep be "d" km and let the speed of the jeep be "s" km/hr.
During the forward journey, the speed of the jeep is "s" km/hr and the time taken is 6 hours.
Therefore, d = 6s.  ----(1)
During the return journey, the speed of the jeep is "s+12" km/hr and the time taken is 4 hours.
Therefore, d = (s+12)*4.  ----(2)
From equations (1) and (2), we get:
6s = 4(s+12)
6s = 4s + 48
2s = 48
s = 24
Substituting the value of "s" in equation (1), we get:
d = 6s = 6*24 = 144
Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144km.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Solution:
Let's assume that the jeep's speed during the forward journey is "x" km/hr. 
Using the formula, Distance = Speed × Time
Distance covered in the forward journey = x × 6 = 6x km
During the return journey, the jeep's speed increased by 12km/hr, so the speed during the return journey is (x + 12) km/hr.
Distance covered in the return journey = (x + 12) × 4 = 4x + 48 km
Total distance covered = Distance in forward journey + Distance in return journey
Total distance = 6x + 4x + 48 = 10x + 48 km
Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 10x + 48 km.
We need to find the value of "x" to get the distance travelled by the jeep.
Using the given information, we can form an equation as follows:
Distance travelled in the forward journey = Distance travelled in the return journey
6x = 4x + 48
2x = 48
x = 24
Substituting the value of "x" in the equation we got earlier, we get
Total distance = 10x + 48 = 10(24) + 48 = 240 + 48 = 288 km

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 28
  C: 30
  D: 53
  E: 59
Response 0:
Let n be the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies. Since the number of water lilies doubles every 2 days, we can write the equation:

64 * 2^(n/2) = total number of water lilies on day n

Since we know that the lake is fully covered with water lilies on day n, we can set the total number of water lilies on day n equal to the area of the lake. Let A be the area of the lake. We can write the equation:

A = pi * r^2

Since the lake is fully covered with water lilies, we can assume that the area of the lake is the same as the area covered by the water lilies. Let R be the radius of the lake when it is fully covered with water lilies. We can write the equation:

A = pi * R^2 = 64 * 2^(n/2)

Solving for n, we get:

n = 2 * log2(8 * pi * R^2/64)

n = 2 * log2(pi * R^2/8)

n = 2 * (log2(pi) + log2(R) - 3)

n = 2 * log2(R) - 2 * log2(8/pi)

n = 2 * log2(R) - 2 * log2(4/pi)

n = 2 * log2(R) + 2 * log2(pi/4)

n = 2 * (log2(R) + log2(pi/4))

n = 2 * log2(R*pi/4)

n = 2 * log2(R*pi) - 2

n = 2 * log2(R) + 2 * log2(pi) - 2

n = 2 * log2(R) + 4.28

Substituting R = 60/sqrt(pi), we get:

n = 2 * log2(60/sqrt(pi)) + 4.28

n ≈ 29.3

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in approximately 29.3 days.

Answer: Answer("B") 28
Response 1:
Let the number of doubling periods be "x". Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, we can write an equation relating the number of lilies to the number of doubling periods: 

2^x = (number of lilies initially) 

If initially, there were 64 lilies, then: 

2^x = 64 

Solving for x, we get x = 6. 

So it takes 6 doubling periods, or 12 days, for the lake to go from 64 lilies to 2^6 * 64 = 4096 lilies. 

Now we can use the information that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies starting from 1 lily: 

60 = 2 * 30 = 2^2 * 15 = 2^3 * 5 

The lake is fully covered after 3 doubling periods, or 6 days, starting from 1 lily. 

So to find out how long it takes to fully cover the lake starting from 64 lilies, we need to add the time it takes to go from 64 to 4096 lilies (12 days) to the time it takes to go from 1 to 4096 lilies (6 days): 

12 + 6 = 18 

Answer: Answer("None of the Above") (The answer is not one of the choices. The correct answer is 18 days.)
Response 2:
Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies doubles from 1 to 2^6 (64).
The number of times the number of water lilies doubles is 6 since 2^6 = 64.
So, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 6 * 2 = 12 days if there was initially just one water lily on it.
Since initially, there are 64 water lilies, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 12 + log2(64) * 2 = 30 days.
Therefore, the answer is Answer("C").
Response 3:
Let x be the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies.
From the problem, we know that the number of lilies doubles every two days. Therefore, after x days, there will be 64 * (2^(x/2)) lilies on the lake.
We know that when there is exactly one lily, it takes 60 days to cover the lake. Therefore: 1 = 2^(60/2) => 1 = 2^30
We can use this to solve for x:
64 * (2^(x/2)) = 2^30
2^(6 + x/2) = 2^30
6 + x/2 = 30
x/2 = 24
x = 48

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies be "d". We can use the following equation to solve for "d":
2^(d/2) = 60 + 1  (when there was 1 water lily on the lake)
2^(d/2) = 2^6 * 2^-1
2^(d/2) = 2^5
d/2 = 5
d = 10

Now, we need to find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, given that there were initially 64 water lilies on it. Let's call this number of days "x":
2^(x/2) = 64
2^(x/2) = 2^6
x/2 = 6
x = 12

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 12 days, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's solve this problem by first finding the growth rate of the water lilies, then using that rate to determine how long it will take to reach 100% coverage.

After two days, there will be 2 water lilies on the lake (since they double every two days). After four days, there will be 4 * 2 = 8 water lilies. After six days, there will be 8 * 2 = 16 water lilies. We can see that the number of water lilies is doubling every two days, so we can express the number of water lilies after t days as:

N(t) = 2^(t/2)

If there were initially 64 water lilies, we can set up the following equation to solve for t:

2^(t/2) = 64 * 2^(60/2)

2^(t/2) = 64 * 2^30

2^(t/2) = 2^6 * 2^30

2^(t/2) = 2^36

t/2 = 36

t = 72

So it will take 72 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if there were initially 64 water lilies.

Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let's solve the problem. 

We know that the number of water lilies doubles every two days. So, if initially, there were 64 water lilies, after two days, there will be 64 * 2 = 128 water lilies. After four days, there will be 128 * 2 = 256 water lilies. We can see that the number of water lilies on the lake follows a pattern of exponential growth.

Let's assume that it takes x days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, starting from 64 water lilies. We can set up the following equation based on the given information:

64 * 2^(x/2) = A, where A is the final number of water lilies on the lake.

We know that A is the number of water lilies on the lake when it is fully covered, which we don't know yet. However, we do know that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies starting from 1 water lily. So, we can set up another equation:

1 * 2^(60/2) = A

Simplifying the equation:

1 * 2^30 = A

A = 1073741824

Now we can solve for x:

64 * 2^(x/2) = 1073741824

2^(x/2) = 16777216

Taking the logarithm of both sides:

x/2 * log(2) = log(16777216)

x/2 = 24

x = 48

So, starting from 64 water lilies, it will take 48 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's start by finding the initial number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies. We know that the number of lilies doubles every two days, so after 60 days, there will be 2^30 lilies on the lake. 

To find the initial number of lilies, we can work backwards. If the lake was fully covered with lilies after 60 days, then it must have been half-covered with lilies after 58 days (since the number of lilies doubles every two days). 

So, after 58 days, there were 2^29 lilies on the lake. Continuing backwards, after 56 days, there were 2^28 lilies on the lake, and after 54 days, there were 2^27 lilies on the lake. 

After 52 days, there were 2^26 lilies on the lake, which is 64 (since that's the initial number of lilies). Therefore, it took 52 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, starting from an initial number of 64 lilies. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies doubles.
The final number of water lilies is 2^x, where x is the number of times the initial number of water lilies doubles. We know that 2^x = 2^6, since the initial number of water lilies is 64 (2^6). Therefore, x = 6.
Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, it takes 2 * 6 = 12 days for the number of water lilies to double 6 times.
Thus, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies after 60 + 12 = 72 days.

Question: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?
Choices:
  A: 40.8
  B: 41.6
  C: 42.2
  D: 43.5
  E: 44.8
Response 0:
Let the weight of the new heavy duty truck be x. 

The sum of weights of the 10 vehicles before the truck was added is 10*12.2 = 122 tons. 

After the truck was added, there are 11 vehicles with an average weight of 12.2+2.6 = 14.8 tons. 

Therefore, the sum of the weights of all 11 vehicles is 11*14.8 = 162.8 tons. 

The sum of the weights of the original 10 vehicles plus the weight of the new heavy duty truck is 122+x. 

We can now set up an equation: 

(122 + x)/11 = 14.8 

Solving for x: 

122 + x = 162.8 

x = 40.8

Response 6:
Let's assume the weight of the new heavy-duty truck is x.
The total weight of the 10 vehicles before the new truck is added is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.
After the new truck is added, the total weight of the 11 vehicles becomes 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.
Therefore, the weight of the new heavy-duty truck is x = 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons.

Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let the weight of the new heavy duty truck be x. 

The total weight of the 10 vehicles before the new truck was added is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons. 

After the new truck was added, the new total weight is (10 * 12.2) + x. 

The new average weight can be expressed as: 

(10 * 12.2 + x) / 11 = 12.2 + 2.6 

Simplifying the equation: 

122 + x = 11 * 14.8 

x = 44.8 

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Let w be the weight of the heavy duty truck. Then, we know that:

(10 * 12.2 + w) / 11 = 12.2 + 2.6

Solving for w:

122 + w = 11 * 14.8

w = 162.8 - 122

w = 40.8

Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 40.8 tons.

Question: Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Choices:
  A: 50 %
  B: 60 %
  C: 55 %
  D: 70 %
  E: 58%
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")  

Explanation: 
The cost price of 90 kg of oranges = Rs. 450  
The selling price of 90 kg of oranges = 90 x Rs. 7.50 = Rs. 675  
Profit made on the sale = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225  
Percentage profit = (Profit / Cost Price) x 100 = (225 / 450) x 100 = 50%
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C") 

The total selling price of 90 kg of oranges at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg is Rs. (90 x 7.50) = Rs. 675.

The profit made by the merchant is Rs. (675 - 450) = Rs. 225.

Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is (225/450) x 100% = 50%.

Hence, the percentage gain of the merchant is 55%.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A") 

The cost price of 90 kg of oranges = Rs. 450
The selling price of 90 kg of oranges = 90 x Rs. 7.50 = Rs. 675

Profit = Selling price - Cost price = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225

Percentage gain = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 = (225 / 450) x 100 = 50%
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A") 

The cost price of 90 kg of oranges = Rs. 450  
The selling price of 90 kg of oranges = 90 x Rs. 7.50 = Rs. 675  

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225  

Percentage profit = (Profit / Cost Price) x 100  
= (225 / 450) x 100 = 50%  

Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is 50%.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")  

Explanation: 
Cost price of 1 kg of oranges = 450/90 = Rs. 5
Selling price of 1 kg of oranges = Rs. 7.50
Profit per kg of oranges = 7.50 - 5 = Rs. 2.50
Profit percentage = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100
Profit percentage = (2.50/5) x 100 = 50%
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A") 

Explanation: 

Cost price of 1 kg of oranges = 450/90 = Rs. 5

Selling price of 1 kg of oranges = Rs. 7.50

Profit per 1 kg of oranges = Selling price - Cost price = Rs. 7.50 - Rs. 5 = Rs. 2.50

Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100
                  = (2.5/5) x 100
                  = 50% 

Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is 50%.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
The total selling price of 90 kg of oranges = 90 * 7.50 = Rs. 675
Profit = Selling price - Cost price = 675 - 450 = Rs. 225
Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 = (225 / 450) x 100 = 50%
So the percentage gain is 50%

Question: Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ?

  B: 23
  C: 16
  D: 18
  E: 12
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("15")

Explanation: 

Let's assume that the coin landed on Heads x times and Tails y times. 

So, total number of coin flips = x+y = 20.

Also, we know that Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan each time the coin landed on Heads and Jonathan gave $3 to Christopher each time the coin landed on Tails. 

Therefore, total amount given by Christopher to Jonathan = 2x

Total amount given by Jonathan to Christopher = 3y

As per the question, both of them neither won nor lost any amount. 

So, 2x = 3y

=> x = (3/2)y

Now, let's substitute the value of x in the first equation.

x + y = 20

(3/2)y + y = 20

(5/2)y = 20

y = 8

So, x = (3/2)y = 12

Therefore, the coin landed on Heads 12 times.

Response 9:
Action: Answer("15")

Explanation: 
Let H be the number of times the coin lands on heads, and T be the number of times it lands on tails. 
Each time the coin lands on heads, Christopher gives Jonathan $2, so Christopher gives Jonathan a total of 2H dollars. Each time the coin lands on tails, Jonathan gives Christopher $3, so Jonathan gives Christopher a total of 3T dollars. 
Since after twenty flips, neither Christopher nor Jonathan wins or loses any money, we have 2H = 3T. 
Since we know that H + T = 20, we can solve for H:
2H = 3T
2H = 3(20 - H)
2H = 60 - 3H
5H = 60
H = 12
Therefore, the coin landed on heads 12 times.

Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's call the distance between A and B as "d". 

If Kevin drives at 70 mph from A to B, he will take d/70 hours. 

On his way back, if he drives at 90 mph from B to A, he will take d/90 hours. 

We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already covered d-70 miles of the total distance. 

We can set up an equation using the information above:

d-70 = (d/70 + d/90 - 3) * 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

d = 360

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 360 miles.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let the distance between A and B be x.  

Since Kevin's speed from A to B is 70 mph, the time it took him to travel from A to B is x/70. 

When he turned right around, he was 2x away from his destination. Since he was driving at a constant speed of 90 mph, the time it took him to travel back from B to the point 70 miles away from B is (2x-70)/90. 

Since we know that he had 3 hours left before the end of his trip at the point he was 70 miles away from B, we can set up the following equation: 

x/70 + (2x-70)/90 + 3 = (x/90) 

Solving for x, we get x = 360. 

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 360 miles.

Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")  
The number is 42857. 
Explanation: 
Let the 5 digit number be abcde. 
According to the problem, 1abcde = 3a(bcde+10000) 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
29999a = 9999bcde + 300000 
Dividing both sides by 3, we get: 
9999a = 3333bcde + 100000 
Since a is a digit, the only possibility is a = 4. 
Substituting a = 4 in the above equation, we get: 
39996 = 3333bcde + 100000 
Dividing both sides by 3, we get: 
13332 = 1111bcde + 33333 
Now, since bcde is a 4-digit number, the only possibility is bcde = 2857. 
Therefore, the number is 42857.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each daughter = 4x and the share of each son = 5x.

Total number of people = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11

Total amount = Rs 8600

Therefore, (5 * 5x) + (4 * 4x) + (2 * x) = 8600

Simplifying the equation, we get:

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200

Hence, the share of each daughter = 4x = 4 * 200 = Rs. 800

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let's start by finding out how much each nephew receives. Let the amount each nephew receives be x. 

Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x. 

Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x. 

The total number of recipients is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. The total amount distributed is Rs 8600. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600 

43x = 8600 

x = 200 

So each nephew receives Rs 200. 

Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800. 

Therefore, the answer is E: Rs 800. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each daughter is 4x and share of each son is 5x.

Total number of shares = 5+4+2=11

Sum of their shares = 8600

So, x = 200

Therefore, each daughter's share = 4x = 4*200 = Rs. 800

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let the amount each nephew receives be x.
Each daughter will receive 4x.
Each son will receive 5x.
Total number of recipients = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11
Total amount distributed = Rs. 8600
So, we have the equation:
5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
Solving for x, we get x = 200
Therefore, each daughter will receive 4x = 4(200) = Rs. 800

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let the amount each nephew receives be x.
Amount received by each daughter = 4x
Amount received by each son = 5x
Total number of children = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11
Total amount = Rs. 8600

We can form the following equation:
5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200

Amount received by each daughter = 4x = 4(200) = Rs. 800

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E")  Rs. 800.
Response 5:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, share of each daughter = 4x and share of each son = 5x.
Total number of shares = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
Sum of all the shares = 8600
Therefore, x = 200
Hence, each daughter gets 4x = Rs 800.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let the amount received by each nephew be x. 

Amount received by each daughter = 4x 
Amount received by each son = 5x 

Total number of children = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 

Total amount = Rs 8600 

We can set up the following equation: 

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600 

Simplifying: 

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600 
43x = 8600 
x = 200 

So each nephew received Rs 200. 

Each daughter received 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800. 

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("E") Rs 800.
Response 7:
Let the share of each nephew be x. Then each daughter will receive 4x and each son will receive 5x. 

So, the total amount will be: 
4 * 4x (for daughters) + 5 * 5x (for sons) + 2 * x (for nephews) = 8600 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 
16x + 25x + 2x = 8600 
43x = 8600 
x = 200 

Therefore, each daughter will receive: 
4x = 4 * 200 = Rs 800 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let the share of each nephew be x. 

Then, the share of each daughter = 4x and the share of each son = 5x. 

Total number of shares = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. 

Total amount = Rs. 8600. 

So, the value of each share = 8600/11. 

The share of each daughter = 4x = 4*(8600/11)/4 = Rs. 1564. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Let the share of each nephew be Rs. x.
Then, share of each son = Rs. 5x, and share of each daughter = Rs. 4 × (Rs. x) = Rs. 4x.
Total share of nephews = 2x, total share of sons = 5x × 5 = 25x, and total share of daughters = 4x × 4 = 16x.
According to the question, we have the equation:
2x + 25x + 16x = 8600
Solving for x, we get x = 200
Thus, share of each daughter = Rs. 4x = Rs. 800
Therefore, the answer is E: Rs 800.

Question: A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 2520
  C: 1728
  D: 1656
  E: None
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")  

Let the number be x.  
The student found the value of 7/18 of the number, which is (7/18)x  
The actual value of 7/8 of the number is (7/8)x  
The difference between the two values is given as 770.  
(7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770  
Multiplying both sides by 72, the LCM of 8 and 18, we get:  
63x - 28x = 55440  
35x = 55440  
x = 1584  

Therefore, the number is 1584.

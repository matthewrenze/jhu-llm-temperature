Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Let's denote the total number of employees as 100. 
Then, 75% = 75 employees take a winter vacation.
40% = 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations.
20% = 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacations.
Let's denote the number of employees who take a summer vacation as S.
Then, the number of employees who take summer but not winter vacation = S - 40.
We can set up an equation based on the given information: 
100 = 75 + S - 40 + 20 + (S - 40)
Solving for S, we get S = 65.
Therefore, the number of employees who take summer but not winter vacation is S - 40 = 25.
This means that 25% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let W be the set of employees that take a winter vacation and S be the set of employees that take a summer vacation.
Then, |W| = 75%, |W ∩ S| = 40%, and |W' ∩ S'| = 20%, where ' denotes the complement of the set.
We want to find |S' ∩ W|.
Using the formula, |W ∪ S| = |W| + |S| - |W ∩ S|, we can find that |S| = 90%.
Using the formula, |W ∪ S| = 100% - |W' ∩ S'|, we can find that |W ∪ S| = 80%.
Thus, |S' ∩ W| = |S| - |W ∩ S| = 50% - 40% = 10%.
Therefore, the answer is: Answer("A").

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. 
Out of them, 75 employees take a winter vacation and 40 employees take both winter and summer vacation.
So, the number of employees taking only winter vacation will be (75-40) = 35.
Also, 20 employees don't take either winter or summer vacation. 
So, the total number of employees who take summer vacation will be (100-20) = 80.
Out of them, the number of employees who take both winter and summer vacation is 40.
Thus, the number of employees who take only summer vacation will be (80-40) = 40.
So, the percent of employees who take summer vacation but not winter vacation will be (40/100)*100 = 40%.

Therefore, 

Action: Answer("E") 
Response 6:
Let W, S, and E denote the number of employees who take a winter vacation, summer vacation, and either vacation, respectively. Then E = 100 - 20 = 80%. We are looking for the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation only, which is S - W + (neither W nor S) = S - W + 20%. We can write E = W + S - (W and S) + 20%. We can also write S = (40%)E, W = (75%)E, and (W and S) = (W + S - E) because W + S - E counts those who take both vacations twice. Substituting, we get 80% = (75% + 40% - (W and S)) + 20%. So, (W and S) = 35%. Therefore, Q = S - W + (neither W nor S) = 40% - 75% + 35% = 0%. So the answer is A. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let W be the percent of employees taking a winter vacation and S be the percent of employees taking a summer vacation. We are given that:
- W + S - WS = 0.4   (40% take a winter and a summer vacation)
- W + (1 - W - S) + (1 - W)(1 - S) = 0.2   (20% take neither)
Simplifying the second equation, we get:
- W - S + 2WS = -0.8
- 2WS + S = W - 0.8
- S(2W - 1) = W - 0.8
- S = (W - 0.8) / (2W - 1)
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:
- W + (1 - W - 0.75) + (1 - W)(1 - S) = 0.2
Simplifying and substituting S, we get:
- 0.25 + 0.25W + 0.75S = W - WS + 0.8
- 0.25 + 0.25W + 0.75[(W - 0.8) / (2W - 1)] = W - W[(W - 0.8) / (2W - 1)] + 0.8
- 0.25 + 0.25W + 0.75(W - 0.8) / (2W - 1) = W - W(W - 0.8) / (2W - 1) + 0.8
- 0.25(2W - 1) + 0.25W(2W - 1) + 0.75(W - 0.8) = W(2W - 1) - W(W - 0.8) + 0.8(2W - 1)
- 0.5 + 0.5W + 1.5W - 1.2 = 2W^2 - W^2 + 0.8W + 1.6 - 0.8
- 0.7W + 0.3 = W^2 + 0.8W
- W^2 + 1.5W - 0.3 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
- W = (-(1.5) ± sqrt((1.5)^2 - 4(-0.3))) / (-2)
- W = 0.3 or 1
Since the percentage of employees taking a winter vacation must be less than or equal to 75%, we have:
- W = 0.3
Substituting into the first equation, we get:
- S = 0.2
Substituting into the expression for S above, we get:
- Q = (0.2 - 0.8) / (2(0.3) - 1) = -0.3 / (-0.4) = 0.75
Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("None of the Above") [Note: Although none of the choices match the result, the closest choice is (C) 25%, which is not the correct answer.]
Response 9:
Let W = the percentage of employees taking winter vacation, and S = the percentage of employees taking summer vacation. We know that W = 75%, W+S-40% = S-x%, and 100%-W-S+40% = 20%, where x% is the percentage of employees who take both winter and summer vacation. Simplifying the second equation, we have W-x% = 40%-S. Adding this equation and the third equation together, we get 100%-20% = W+S-x%-40%-S+40%. Solving for x%, we get x% = 15%. Therefore, the percentage of employees taking a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is S-x% = S-15%. Since we don't know the actual value of S, we cannot determine the exact percentage. However, we know that S-15% must be less than S, so the best answer is (B) 15%.

Topic: Math
Question: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 10
  C: 12
  D: 15
  E: 19
Response 0:
Let's assume that x helpers are needed to prepare the required number of cakes.
Therefore, the time required to make 20 large cakes by one helper = 20 / 2 = 10 hours
And, the time required to make 700 small cakes by one helper = 700 / 35 = 20 hours
Now, we have 3 hours to work with, therefore, we can calculate the total time available as 3x.
So, the total time required to make 20 large cakes with x helpers = 10 / x
And, the total time required to make 700 small cakes with x helpers = 20 / x
Thus, the equation can be formed as follows:
10 / x + 20 / x ≤ 3
Multiplying by the LCM of x,
10x + 20x ≤ 3x^2
3x^2 - 30x - 40x ≥ 0
x^2 - 23x ≤ 0
x(x - 23) ≤ 0
Therefore, x can be either 0 or x ≤ 23
Since x cannot be 0, the maximum number of helpers required is 23.
Now, we need to check which option out of A, B, C, D and E satisfies this condition.
Answer: Answer("A") - 8
Response 1:
Let's assume that x helpers are required to prepare all the cakes in the given time. So, the equation would be:
    
    2 * x * 3 + 35 * x * 3 = 20 + 700
    
Simplifying the above equation, we get:

    111x = 240
    
    x = 240/111

Therefore, 

    x ≈ 2.16

We know that we cannot have 0.16th of a person, so we need to round this up to the nearest whole number as we cannot have a fractional number of helpers. Hence, we need 3 helpers to prepare all the cakes in the given time.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") [The correct answer is 3 (None of the above)]
Response 2:
Let's start by finding out how many large cakes and small cakes one assistant can make in 1 hour:
- One assistant can make 2 large cakes in 1 hour.
- One assistant can make 35 small cakes in 1 hour.

Let x be the number of helpers needed.
Then, the total number of hours the helpers work is 3:
- x helpers * 3 hours = 3x hours

Using the information above, we can set up the following system of equations:
- 2 * 20 = 40 (number of large cakes needed)
- 35 * 700 = 24500 (number of small cakes needed)
- 2x * 3 + 35x * 3 = 40 + 24500
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
- 111x = 24620
- x = 222/37

This means that we need 5.99... assistants, which is not a whole number. Therefore, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

Action: Answer("C") 
Response 3:
Let's assume there are x helpers required.
The total number of large cakes that can be made by all x helpers in 3 hours is:
3x * 2 = 6x
The total number of small cakes that can be made by all x helpers in 3 hours is:
3x * 35 = 105x

To solve this problem we need to solve the following equations:
6x >= 20   [At least 20 large cakes are needed]
105x >= 700 [At least 700 small cakes are needed]
3x <= 3    [The kitchen is available for 3 hours]

Dividing the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 35 we get:
3x >= 10   [Simplifying 6x >= 20]
3x >= 20   [Simplifying 105x >= 700]
3x <= 3    [The kitchen is available for 3 hours]

The largest integer x that satisfies all three inequalities is 10.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
First, let's calculate how many cakes can be made in 3 hours, assuming only large cakes are made. Since each helper can make 2 large cakes in an hour, in 3 hours, one helper can make 2 x 3 = 6 large cakes. Thus, the number of large cakes that can be made by one helper in 3 hours is 6.

Similarly, let's calculate how many cakes can be made in 3 hours, assuming only small cakes are made. Since each helper can make 35 small cakes in an hour, in 3 hours, one helper can make 35 x 3 = 105 small cakes. Thus, the number of small cakes that can be made by one helper in 3 hours is 105.

Now, let's calculate how many large and small cakes can be made by one helper in 3 hours. Since one helper can make either 6 large cakes or 105 small cakes in 3 hours, they can make 6/20 = 0.3 large cakes per minute, or 105/20 = 5.25 small cakes per minute.

Next, let's calculate how many large and small cakes are needed in total. We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. Thus, we need 20/3 = 6.67 large cakes per hour, or 700/3 = 233.33 small cakes per hour.

Now, let's calculate how many helpers are needed to make the required number of cakes in 3 hours. To make 20 large cakes in 3 hours, we need 20/(3 x 0.3) = 22.22 helpers. To make 700 small cakes in 3 hours, we need 700/(3 x 5.25) = 42.42 helpers. Since we need more helpers to make small cakes than large cakes, we need 42.42 helpers, which is closest to answer E: 19.
 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let's assume there are x helpers required to make the necessary cakes. Then, the total number of hours worked by all x helpers is 3. We can write the following equation to solve for x: 

2*x*h + 35*x*h = 20*2 + 700
where h is the number of hours the helpers work and the right-hand side of the equation represents the total number of cakes needed.

Simplifying the equation, we get:
70xh = 740
xh = 10.57

Since we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up the value of xh to the nearest integer, which is 11.

Therefore, Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's start by calculating how many cakes can be made in the available time.
In 3 hours, a helper can make:
- 6 large cakes (2 cakes/hour x 3 hours) or
- 105 small cakes (35 cakes/hour x 3 hours)
In 20 large cakes, we need (20 / 2) = 10 helper-hours to complete the work.
In 700 small cakes, we need (700 / 35) = 20 helper-hours to complete the work.
So, the total helper-hours required = 10 + 20 = 30
Now, let's calculate how many helpers are required:
If a helper can make 6 large cakes in 3 hours, to make 20 large cakes we need (20/6) = 3.33 or say 4 helpers.
Similarly, if a helper can make 105 small cakes in 3 hours, to make 700 small cakes we need (700/105) = 6.67 or say 7 helpers.
Therefore, the minimum number of helpers needed is 4 + 7 = 11.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's start by finding the number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours:
3 hours x 2 large cakes per hour per assistant = 6 large cakes per assistant
Next, let's find the number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours:
3 hours x 35 small cakes per hour per assistant = 105 small cakes per assistant
To make 20 large cakes, we need 10 assistants (20 large cakes ÷ 2 large cakes per assistant = 10 assistants).
To make 700 small cakes, we need 7 assistants (700 small cakes ÷ 105 small cakes per assistant = 6.67, which we will round up to 7 assistants).
Since we need at least 7 assistants for the small cakes and at least 10 for the large cakes, we need a minimum of 10 assistants.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let's assume we need x helpers to prepare the cakes. Then the time to make 20 large cakes is 10 hours for x helpers, and the time to make 700 small cakes is 20 hours for x helpers. Since they have 3 hours, we need to find the number of cakes that can be prepared in 3 hours by x helpers.
In 3 hours, the number of large cakes that can be made is 3 * x * 2 = 6x.
In 3 hours, the number of small cakes that can be made is 3 * x * 35 = 105x.
To meet the demand, we need at least 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. So, we can set up the following system of equations:

  20 ≤ 6x
  700 ≤ 105x

Solving the above system of equations, we get:

  x ≥ 10/3
  x ≥ 20/105

Therefore, we can conclude that x ≥ 10/3. So, we need at least 4 helpers to prepare the cakes.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let's assume we need x helpers.
So, x helpers can make 2x large cakes or 35x small cakes in an hour.
Let's calculate how many cakes we can make in 3 hours (which is the maximum time that we have):
With large cakes:
2x * 3 = 6x
With small cakes:
35x * 3 = 105x
We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
Let's substitute the values we calculated above in the equations:
6x >= 20
x >= 20/6
x >= 3.33 (We can't have a fraction of a person, so we round it up to 4)
105x >= 700
x >= 700/105
x >= 6.67 (We can't have a fraction of a person, so we round it up to 7)
So, we need at least 4 helpers to make 20 large cakes and 7 helpers to make 700 small cakes.
We need to choose the maximum number of helpers required, so we need 7 helpers.

  B: 15
  C: 18

Response 0:
Let H be the set of hardcover books and F be the set of fiction books. We know that |H|=30, |F|=20 and |H∩F|<=min(|H|, |F|).

Action: Answer("20")
Response 1:
First, we know that there are 30 hardcover books and 20 fiction books. Since the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is equal to or less than the number of hardcover books, the answer cannot be more than 30. However, we also know that there are only 45 books in total, so it cannot be that all 30 hardcovers are also fiction. Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction must be less than 30.  

Action: Answer("A")  

The only choice less than 30 is 10, which is also possible since there could be 10 books that are both hardcover and fiction, in addition to the 20 fiction books that are not hardcover and the 20 hardcover books that are not fiction.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
First, we know that there are 30 hardcover books and 20 fiction books, but we don't know if there are any books that are both. To find out, we need to take the intersection of the two sets: 

30 hardcover books ∩ 20 fiction books = maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction

To find the intersection, we take the smaller of the two sets (in this case, the set of fiction books) and see how many of those books are also in the other set (hardcover books):

20 fiction books ∩ 30 hardcover books = maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction

Now we just need to find the size of the intersection: 

20 + 30 - 45 = maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction

The reason we add 20 and 30 is that if we just add them together, we'll be counting the intersection twice (since the intersection is made up of books that are in both sets). So we need to subtract the size of the intersection (which is just the total number of books minus the number that are not both hardcover and fiction):

20 + 30 - 45 = 5

So the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 5.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
We know that there are a total of 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover. This means at most, 30 books can be both hardcover and fiction as all hardcover books are not necessarily fiction. Similarly, 20 books are fiction, and we know that at most 30 books can be hardcover, so the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is equal to the number of fiction books, which is 20. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
First, we need to recognize that the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction can't exceed 20, since there are only 20 books that are fiction. Also, since there are only 30 hardcovers, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction can't exceed 30. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A") 
Response 7:
To solve the problem, we need to find the minimum value between the number of hardcover books and the number of fiction books. This is because the maximum number of books that fulfill both conditions can't be greater than the minimum value since the number of books fulfilling both conditions is a subset of each individual condition. 

We have: 
- Number of hardcover books = 30
- Number of fiction books = 20

Thus, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is:

Action: Answer("20")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
First, we know that the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction cannot be greater than the number of hardcover books nor the number of fiction books. So, it must be less than or equal to 20.
We also know that the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is the intersection of the sets of hardcover books and fiction books. Therefore, we can get the maximum number of books that are both by finding the size of the intersection of the two sets.
To do that, we can use the formula:
Size of intersection = Size of set A + Size of set B - Size of union
where:
- Set A is the set of hardcover books
- Set B is the set of fiction books
- Union is the set of books that are either hardcover or fiction (i.e., the union of sets A and B)
Using the given values, we can compute the size of the union:
Size of union = Size of set A + Size of set B - Size of intersection
Size of union = 30 + 20 - Size of intersection = 50 - Size of intersection
Since the total number of books is 45, we know that the size of the union cannot be greater than 45. Therefore:
50 - Size of intersection <= 45
Size of intersection >= 5
So, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is at least 5. We also know that it cannot be greater than 20. Therefore, the only possible answer is:

Question: An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.
Choices:
  A: 21
  B: 22
  C: 20
  D: 23
  E: 24
Response 0:
Solution: 

Let's denote the height of the tree with 'h'.

We can set up a proportion as follows:

height of the pole / length of the pole's shadow = height of the tree / length of the tree's shadow

Plugging in the values we get:

14 / 10 = h / 15

Cross-multiplying we get:

10h = 14 x 15

Solving for h we get:

h = 21

Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
First, we need to recognize that the two situations are similar. That means the ratios of corresponding sides will be equal. We can set this up as a proportion:

height of pole / length of shadow of pole = height of tree / length of shadow of tree

Substituting the given values, we get:

14 / 10 = height of tree / 15

Solving for the height of the tree, we get:

height of tree = 14 x 15 / 10 = 21

Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
Choices:
  A: 4,000
  B: 4,200
  C: 4,500
  D: 4,800
  E: 5,000
Response 0:
Let's start by using algebra:
Let x be the total number of staplers produced that day
10% of the staplers were defective so 0.1x staplers were defective
Thus, 0.9x staplers were non-defective
2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected so 0.02(0.9x) = 72
Simplifying the equation, we get 0.018x = 72
Solving for x, we get x = 4000
Therefore, the answer is A: 4,000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
First, let's find the total number of defective staplers produced:
10% of staplers produced = 0.1x
Since we don't know the total number of staplers produced, let's call it "y":
0.1x = 0.1y
Next, let's find the number of non-defective staplers produced:
non-defective staplers = y - 0.1y = 0.9y
Now let's find the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected:
2% of non-defective staplers = 0.02(0.9y) = 0.018y
We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up an equation:
0.018y = 72
y = 4000
Therefore, the answer is A: 4,000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the total number of staplers produced on Monday is 'x'.
The number of defective staplers produced = 0.1x
So the number of non-defective staplers produced = 0.9x

Now, we know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 72
0.02 * 0.9x = 72
0.018x = 72
x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day were 4000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's say that the number of staplers produced on Monday was "x". 
10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so the number of defective staplers produced was 0.1x.
90 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were non-defective, so the number of non-defective staplers produced was 0.9x.
2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of non-defective staplers rejected was 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x.
We know that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up an equation: 

0.018x = 72 

Solving for "x", we get: 

x = 4,000 

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4,000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's start by assuming the total number of staplers produced to be 'x'. 

The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x

The number of non-defective staplers produced = 90% of x = 0.9x

Now, the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected mistakenly = 2% of non-defective staplers = 0.02 * 0.9x = 0.018x

We know that the number of rejected non-defective staplers = 72

Therefore, 0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we get x = 4000

Hence, the answer is A: 4,000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the factory produced x staplers on Monday. 

The number of defective staplers produced = 10% of x = 0.1x
So, the number of non-defective staplers produced = x - 0.1x = 0.9x

2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected, which means 0.02 * 0.9x = 72
Solving the above equation gives us x = 4000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let's start by finding the total number of non-defective staplers produced that day. Since 2% of non-defective staplers were rejected, we can set up the equation:

0.02x = 72

where x is the total number of non-defective staplers produced. Solving for x, we get:

x = 3600

Now, we can use this information to find the total number of staplers produced. If 10% of staplers were defective, then 90% were non-defective. So, we can set up the equation:

0.90y = 3600

where y is the total number of staplers produced. Solving for y, we get:

y = 4000

Therefore, the answer is A: 4,000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let N be the total number of staplers produced on that day. 
The number of defective staplers produced is 10% of N, which is 0.1N.
The number of non-defective staplers produced is 90% of N, which is 0.9N.
2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, which is 0.02 * 0.9N = 0.018N.
We know that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can write an equation:
0.018N = 72
N = 72 / 0.018
N = 4000
Therefore, Action: Answer("A") - 4,000 staplers were produced that day.
Response 8:
Let's first find out the total number of non-defective staplers produced. The number of defective staplers produced would be 10% of the total staplers produced. Therefore, the number of non-defective staplers produced would be 90% of the total staplers produced.
Let x be the total number of staplers produced.
Number of non-defective staplers = 90% of x = 0.90x
Number of defective staplers = 10% of x = 0.10x
Now, 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Therefore, 0.02(0.90x) = 72.
Solving for x:
0.02(0.90x) = 72
0.018x = 72
x = 4000
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let x be the number of staplers produced that day. 
10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective hence 90% were non-defective. Therefore, the number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday was 0.9x.
2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Therefore, the number of non-defective staplers that were not rejected was (100%-2%)=98% = 0.98. Hence, the number of non-defective staplers that were not rejected was (0.98)(0.9x)=0.882x.
The number of non-defective staplers rejected by mistake was 72. Hence, 0.02(0.9x) =72. Solving for x gives x= 4500.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Let's solve this problem using the formula for the probability of the union of two events A and B: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since events A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B). We know that P(A) = 0.6, and P(A or B) = 0.96. Let's substitute these values into the formula and solve for P(B).

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.
We know that P(A) = 0.6, P(A or B) = 0.96, and A and B are independent. 
Therefore, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.6 + 0.4P(B) = 0.96
0.4P(B) = 0.36
P(B) = 0.9
Thus, the answer is Choice (E) 0.9.
Response 2:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring.
We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96.
Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).
Substituting the given values, we get:
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 x P(B))
Solving for P(B), we get:
P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6) = 0.6
Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Let's first find the probability of A and B not occurring: P(A' and B') = P((AUB)') = 1 - P(AUB) = 1 - 0.96 = 0.04
Since A and B are independent, we have:
P(A' and B') = P(A') * P(B')
0.04 = 0.4 * P(B')
P(B') = 0.04 / 0.4 = 0.1
Therefore, the probability of B occurring is:
P(B) = 1 - P(B') = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let P(B) = p
P(A) = 0.6
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + p - 0.6p = 0.96
Solving for p: 
0.6p + p = 0.96 + 0.6
1.6p = 1.56
p = 0.975
Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.975, which is closest to Answer("E").
Response 5:
Let's use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since events A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).

Substituting the given values, we can solve for P(B):
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Then the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 1 - P(neither A nor B occurs), which is 1 - P(A complement intersect B complement). Since A and B are independent, P(A complement intersect B complement) = P(A complement)P(B complement) = (1 - 0.6)(1 - P(B)), where P(A complement) = 1 - P(A) = 0.4. Therefore, 1 - P(A complement intersect B complement) = 1 - (0.4)(1 - P(B)) = 0.96. Solving for P(B), we get P(B) = 0.7.  

Answer: Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's denote the probability of event B as P(B). We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. 

Since A and B are independent events, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
However, since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

Substituting the given values, we get:
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4 
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
We know that:
P(A) = 0.6
P(A or B) = 0.96

We also know that A and B are independent events, so:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

Using the formula for the probability of the union of events, we have:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Substituting the values we know and solving for P(B), we get:
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6*P(B)
0.36 = 0.4*P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring.

We know that:
- P(A) = 0.6
- P(A union B) = 0.96

Since A and B are independent, we have:
P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A intersection B)

We want to find P(B), so we can rearrange and solve for it:
P(B) = (P(A union B) - P(A)) / (1 - P(A intersection B))

Substituting the given values, we get:
P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6*P(B))

Simplifying, we get:
0.4 + 0.6*P(B) = 0.96
0.6*P(B) = 0.56
P(B) = 0.56 / 0.6
P(B) = 0.93333 (rounded to 5 decimal places)

Action: Answer("42.86%") 

Solution: 

Let the original price of the product be P.
After reducing the price by 30%, the new price becomes 0.7P.

To make it 100%, it needs to be increased by (100-70)% = 30%.

So, the new price should be (0.7P) + 0.3(0.7P) = 0.91P.

The percentage increase from 0.7P to 0.91P can be calculated as follows:

((0.91P - 0.7P)/0.7P) × 100% ≈ 30.14%

Therefore, the answer is closest to option B, 42.86%.

Response 1:
Let's call Meenu's weight "M". According to the problem, M = 29 + 0.5M. We can solve for M as follows:
M - 0.5M = 29
0.5M = 29
M = 58

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let's assume Meenu's weight is x.
It is given that Meenu weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight.
So, Meenu's weight can be represented as:
x = 29 + x/2
On solving the above equation, we get:
x/2 = 29
x = 58
Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let's represent Meenu's weight as "x". 
According to the problem, Meenu said "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight", which can be written as:
x = 29 + 0.5x
Solving the equation:
0.5x = 29
x = 58
Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let x be Meenu's weight. Then, from the information given, we know that:

x = 29 + 0.5x

Solving for x, we get:

0.5x = 29

x = 58

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's represent Meenu's weight as "x". According to the question, she weighs "29 kgs plus half of her weight":
x = 29 + x/2
Solving for x:
x/2 = 29
x = 58
Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 kgs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's call Meenu's weight "W". Meenu said she weighs "29 Kgs plus half of my weight", which can be translated as: W = 29 + 0.5W
Solving for W: 
W - 0.5W = 29
0.5W = 29
W = 58

Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let's assume Meenu's weight to be "x" kg.
Then, Meenu's weight can be expressed as:
x = 29 + x/2
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
2x = 58 + x
Subtracting x from both sides, we get:
x = 58
Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 kg.
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's consider "x" to be Meenu's weight in Kgs.

Meenu said "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight."
So, we can write the equation as:

Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let the length of the rectangular yard be L meters and the width be W meters.
The area of the rectangular yard is given as L*W = 240. 
Since one side of the yard is already fenced, Alice needs to fence only three sides.
Therefore, the total length of fencing she needs = 2L + W. 
Since W = 240/L, total length of fencing = 2L + 240/L.
To minimize the fencing needed, we need to find the value of L which minimizes the expression above.
Differentiating the expression with respect to L, we get:
d/dL (2L + 240/L) = 2 - 240/L^2 = 0
Solving the above equation, we get L^2 = 120. Therefore, L = sqrt(120) = 2sqrt(30).
Substituting L = 2sqrt(30) in the expression for total length of fencing, we get:
2L + 240/L = 2*2sqrt(30) + 240/(2sqrt(30)) = 4sqrt(30) + 12sqrt(30) = 16sqrt(30) meters.
Therefore, Alice needs 16sqrt(30) meters of fencing, which is approximately equal to 74 meters.
Hence, the answer is E: 74.

Topic: Math
Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
Choices:
  A: 80
  B: 120
  C: 240
  D: 320
  E: 360
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let the initial number of yellow golf balls be y. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, the initial number of white golf balls must also be y. 

The total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day is 600, so we can set up the following equation: 

y + y + x = 600 

where x is the initial number of white golf balls that the store had. 

At the end of the day, the store had sold 80% of its inventory, so it had 20% (or 1/5) of its original inventory left. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the remaining inventory must consist entirely of yellow golf balls. 

Thus, we can set up the following equation: 

4/5 (y + x) = y 

Multiplying both sides by 5/4: 

y + x = 1.25y 

Substituting the first equation: 

600 = 2y + x 

Substituting 2y + x as 600 in the second equation: 

4/5 (600) = y 

y = 480 

Therefore, the store had 480 yellow golf balls to begin the day. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding out how many golf balls the store sold. If the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, then it sold 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls.

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 240 of each.

If the store sold all of its white golf balls, then it must have had 240 white golf balls to begin the day.

Therefore, the store had 600 total golf balls to begin with, and 240 were white, so the remaining 360 must have been yellow.

Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let the number of yellow golf balls be y. Since the store sold the same number of yellow and white golf balls, and it sold all of its white golf balls, the number of white golf balls it had to begin the day was also y. Therefore, the total number of golf balls the store had to begin the day was 2y.

If the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, then it must have sold 0.8*(2y) = 1.6y golf balls. 

We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, which means it sold y white golf balls. Therefore, it must have sold 1.6y - y = 0.6y yellow golf balls.

We also know that the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, which means it sold a total of 0.8*(2y) = 1.6y golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, we can set up the equation:

0.6y + y = 1.6y

Simplifying:

1.6y - 0.6y = y

y = 400

Therefore, the store had 400 yellow golf balls to begin the day.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's say the store started the day with y yellow golf balls and w white golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, we know that the store sold w white golf balls and w yellow golf balls. We also know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, so:

w + y = 600 (since the store started with a total of 600 golf balls)
w + w = 2w = 80% * 600 = 480 (since the store sold all of its white golf balls)
w = 240

Now we can substitute w = 240 into the first equation to solve for y:

y + 240 = 600
y = 360

Therefore, the store started with 360 yellow golf balls.

Choices:
  A: 126
  B: 77
  C: 88
  D: 66
  E: 54
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let, the train fare for one person be x.
Then, bus fare for two persons will be 4x/3.
The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is (6/2) x 4x/3 = 8x.
The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8x.
According to the question,
8x + 8x = 1512
16x = 1512
x = 94.5

Therefore, the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs.94.5. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Let's consider the train fare for one person as "x". Then the bus fare for two persons would be "4/3x". 

The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus would be (6/2) * (4/3)x = 4x.

The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train would be 8x.

As per the question, 

4x + 8x = 1512

12x = 1512

x = 126

Therefore, the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs.126.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's assume that the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is x.

Since the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds of the train fare for one person, the bus fare for two persons is 4x/3.

Let's now calculate the total cost for 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train:
Total cost = (6/2) * 4x/3 + 8 * x = 12x/3 + 8x = 16x/3

According to the problem, the total cost is Rs. 1512. So, 16x/3 = 1512.

Solving for x,
x = 283.5

Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs. 283.5.

Answer: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")  
Solution:
Let the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for 1 person be x.
Then, the bus fare for 2 persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh = 4/3 × x.
The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus = 6 × (4/3 × x) = 8x.
The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train = 8x.
Given, the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs. 1512.
Therefore, 8x + 6 × (4/3 × x) = 1512.
Simplifying we get, x = 88.
Hence, the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs.88.
Response 5:
Let the train fare for one person be Rs. x.
Then, the bus fare for 2 persons = (4/3)x
The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus = 3 x (4/3)x = 4x
The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train = 8x
Total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train = 4x + 8x = 12x
Given that the total fare is Rs. 1512
So, 12x = 1512
Therefore, x = 126
Hence, the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs. 126.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person be 'x' rupees.
Then, the bus fare for two persons = (4/3)x rupees.
So, the fare for 6 persons travelling by bus = 3 × (4/3)x = 4x rupees.
Also, the fare for 8 persons travelling by train = 8x rupees.
Total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train = 4x + 8x = 12x rupees
Given that the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs. 1512.
Therefore, 12x = 1512
Thus, x = 1512/12 = 126

Topic: Math
Question: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
Choices:
  A: $8
  B: $10
  C: $13.6
  D: $22.9
  E: $40
Response 0:
Solution: 

Let the original price of each article be $x. 

After the discount of 15%, the new price of each article = x - 0.15x = 0.85x.

Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300. 

Therefore, 

5 * (0.85x) = $300 

=> x = $70 

So, the original selling price of each article was $70. 

The new selling price of each article after the discount = 0.85x = 0.85 * 70 = $59.5 

Answer: Answer("None of the Above") - $59.5.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
We can solve this problem using algebra. Let the original price of each article be x dollars. After a 15% decrease, the new price will be 0.85x dollars. We know that for $300, Anna is able to buy 5 more articles at the new price. This gives us the equation:

5(0.85x) = 300

Simplifying, we get:

4.25x = 300

Dividing both sides by 4.25, we get:

x = 70.59

So the original price of each article was $70.59. After a 15% decrease, the new selling price is:

0.85(70.59) = $60.00

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("D") $22.9.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article = x - 0.15x = 0.85x.

Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300.
Therefore, the new total cost = $300.
Let the new selling price of each article be y.
Then, 5y = $300, which implies that y = $60.

So, 5 articles cost $300, which means that the cost of 1 article = $300/5 = $60.

We know that the new price of each article is 0.85x and the new selling price of each article = $60.
Therefore, 0.85x = $60 which implies that x = $70.59.

Hence, the new selling price of each article (rounded to the nearest cent) is $70.59 * 0.85 = $60.00.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Solution:
Let the original selling price of each article be "x".
After a 15% decrease in price, the new selling price of each article = x - 0.15x = 0.85x

Now, Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 at the new selling price.
Therefore, 5(0.85x) = $300
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
4.25x = $300
x = $70

So, the original selling price of each article was $70.
The new selling price of each article after a 15% decrease = 0.85x = 0.85($70) = $59.5

So, Action: Answer("None of the Above")
The correct answer is not one of the available choices.
Response 6:
Solution: 

Let the original price of each article be "p".

We know that Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300. Therefore,

5p + $300 = (p - 0.15p)(p + 5)

Simplifying the above equation and solving for p, we get:

p = $20

Now that we have the original price, we can find the new selling price after the discount of 15% by multiplying the original price by (100% - 15%) = 85%.

New selling price = 85% of $20 = $17

Action: Answer("None of the above") - The correct answer is not in the given choices.
Response 7:
Solution:
Let the original price of each article be x.
The new price of each article is 85% of the original price.
So, the new price of each article is 0.85x.
Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%.
So, she paid (5 * 0.85x) + $300 for the articles.
That is, 4.25x + $300 = $300
Therefore, 4.25x = 300 - 300 = 0
Thus, x = 0/4.25 = 0

This means that the original price of each article was $0, which is not possible.
Therefore, there must be an error in the question. None of the choices is correct.
Response 8:
Solution:
Let's represent the original price of each article as $x. We know that the price of each article decreased by 15% or 0.15. Therefore, the new price of each article is:
x - 0.15x = 0.85x
We also know that Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300. This means that the difference between the original total cost and the new total cost is $300:
5x - 0.85(5x) = 300
Simplifying this equation, we get:
0.15(5x) = 300
x = 400
So the original price of each article was $400. Now we can find the new price of each article:
0.85(400) = 340
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is $340.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")  # The correct answer is not listed in the choices. The closest answer is option C ($13.6), but it is not correct.
Response 9:
First, we can calculate the original price of each article before the 15% discount. Let X be the original price of each article.

Then, the equation becomes:

5X = 300

Solving for X, we get:

X = 60

Now that we know the original price of each article, we can find the new selling price after the 15% discount. Let Y be the new selling price of each article.

We know that the new selling price is 15% less than the original price, so we can set up the equation:

Y = X - 0.15X

Simplifying, we get:

Y = 0.85X

Substituting X = 60, we get:

Y = 0.85 * 60 = 51

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is $51.

Simplifying this equation:
2x - 3 = 20
2x = 23
x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let the length of the shorter part be x. 
By the problem, the length of the longer part is 3 more than the length of the shorter part. 
So, the length of the longer part is (x+3).
The total length of the rope is 20, so we can set up an equation: 

x + (x+3) = 20 

Simplifying, we get: 

2x + 3 = 20 

Subtracting 3 from both sides: 

2x = 17 

Dividing by 2: 

x = 8.5 

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8.5 meters. 

The longer piece is 3 meters more than the shorter piece: 

8.5 + 3 = 11.5 

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. 

The length of the other piece of rope is (x-3). 

The sum of the lengths of the two pieces of rope is 20: 

x + (x-3) = 20 

Simplifying the equation we have: 

2x - 3 = 20 

Adding 3 to each side: 

2x = 23 

Dividing by 2: 

x = 11.5 

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("D").
Response 6:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope, then the length of the shorter piece of rope is (x - 3) meters. The sum of the lengths of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides, we get:

2x = 23

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 11.5

Therefore, the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters long.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope.
Since the length of one piece is 3 meters shorter than the other, then the length of the shorter piece is x - 3 meters.
The sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 20 meters, so we can write an equation: x + (x - 3) = 20.
Simplifying the equation, we have 2x - 3 = 20, then 2x = 23, and x = 11.5.
Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's use algebra to solve this problem. 

Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope (in meters). Then, according to the problem, the length of the shorter piece of rope is (x-3) meters. 

The sum of the lengths of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters: 

x + (x-3) = 20 

Simplifying and solving for x, we get: 

2x - 3 = 20 

2x = 23 

x = 11.5 

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let x be the length of the shorter piece of rope. Since the length of the longer piece of rope is 3 meters longer, then it is x+3. Altogether, we have x + (x+3) = 20. Solving for x, we get 2x+3=20 which gives us x=8.5. Therefore, the longer piece of rope is x+3=11.5 meters.

Question: In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
Choices:
  A: 96
  B: 48
  C: 32
  D: 25
  E: 18
Response 0:
Let's find out how many times a song was selected in total.
Each song was selected 5 times, and there are 10 songs, so the total number of selections is: 5 x 10 = 50

Each student selected 2 songs, so the number of pairs of songs selected is half the total number of selections:
50 / 2 = 25

Therefore, 25 students were surveyed.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's start by calculating the total number of times a song was selected. Since each song was selected 5 times, and there are 10 songs in total, the total number of selections is 5 x 10 = 50.

Now, we need to figure out how many pairs of songs were selected. Each student selected 2 songs, so the number of pairs of songs is half the number of selections: 50 / 2 = 25.

Topic: Math
Question: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 1120
  C: 792
  D: 1320
  E: 1200
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
We can approach this problem using system of equations. Let's suppose the length of the sheet is L and the width is W. When folding the sheet along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. This means the length of each part, after folding, is (48/2 - W) and the width of each part is W. So we have the following equation: 

2(48/2 - W) + 2W = 48 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
L - W = 12 

Similarly, when folding along the width, the length of each part is L and the width of each part is (66/2 - L/2). So we have: 

2L + 2(66/2 - L/2) = 66 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
W - L = 6 

Now we have two equations: 
L - W = 12 
W - L = -6 

Adding these equations, we get: 
0 = 6 

This is not possible. Therefore, there is no solution that satisfies the given conditions. None of the above choices is the correct answer.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's suppose, the sides of the rectangular sheet are 'a' and 'b' and without loss of generality let's assume that a ≥ b. 

When folded along its shorter side (b), the perimeter of each part of the sheet is 48/2=24. So, after folding the length of the shorter side is reduced to b/2. 

Hence, we get the following equation: 2*(b/2) + 2*a = 24, which simplifies to a + b = 24. 

Similarly, when folded along its longer side (a), the perimeter of each part of the sheet is 66/2=33. So, after folding the length of the longer side is reduced to a/2. 

Hence, we get the following equation: 2*(a/2) + 2*b = 33, which simplifies to a + b = 33/2. 

Now, we have two equations: 
a + b = 24,    ------(1)
a + b = 33/2.  ------(2)

Solving these equations, we get a=18 and b=6.

Therefore, the area of the rectangular sheet is a*b = 18*6 = 108.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's denote the length of the rectangle as l and width as w. 

When folded along the width, we get two parts with perimeter 48cm each. This means the length of each such part is (48 - 2w)/2 = 24 - w. 

When folded along the length, we get two parts with perimeter 66cm each. This means the width of each such part is (66 - 2l)/2 = 33 - l. 

We know that the area of the rectangle is lw, and we can relate it to the above equations as follows: 

lw = (24-w)(33-l) 

Expanding, we get 

lw = wl - 24l - 33w + 792 

Simplifying, we get 

w(l-33) = 24(l-33) - 792 

w = (24 - 792/(l-33)) / (l-33) 

We also know that w + l is the length of the unfolded perimeter of the rectangle, i.e., 

2(l+w) = 2l + 2w = 48 + 66 = 114 

l+w = 57 

Substituting the expression for w we derived earlier, we get 

l + (24 - 792/(l-33)) / (l-33) = 57 

Multiplying both sides by (l-33) and simplifying, we get a quadratic equation: 

l^2 - 90l + 1584 = 0 

Solving for l using the quadratic formula, we get 

l = 72 or l = 22 

If l=72, then w = -12/39 which is not possible. Therefore, l = 22 and w = 9. 

Thus, the area of the rectangle is lw = 22*9 = 198 sq. cm. 

Answer: Answer("None of the above") (the correct answer is 198, which is not one of the choices)
Response 7:
Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be "l" and "b" respectively. 

When folded along the length, the perimeter becomes 48 cm, which means the length is halved and perimeter is doubled. 

So, 2b + 2(l/2) = 48
=> b + l = 24

When folded along the breadth, the perimeter becomes 66 cm, which means the breadth is halved and perimeter is doubled. 

So, 2(l/2) + 2l = 66
=> l + b = 33

We can now solve these two equations to find l and b. 

Adding the two equations, we get: 

2l + 2b = 57
=> l + b = 28.5

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: 

l - b = 9.5

Solving the above two equations, we get: 

l = 19
b = 9.5

Area of the sheet = l * b = 19 * 9.5 = 180.5 cm^2

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get the answer as 181. 

Answer: E (1200)
Response 8:
Solution: 

Let's assume the length of the rectangle is 'l' and the width is 'w'. 

When folded along the length (l), the perimeter of each part is 48cm. In this case, the length of each part would be (48/2) - w = 24 - w. So the dimensions of each part would be (l x (24-w)).

When folded along the width (w), the perimeter of each part is 66cm. In this case, the width of each part would be (66/2) - l = 33 - l. So the dimensions of each part would be ((33-l) x w).

Since both parts are equal, we can equate their areas and solve for 'lw':

l(24-w) = w(33-l)

24l - l^2 = 33w - lw

l^2 + lw - 33w + 24l = 0

(l+w)(l-33) = 0

l = 33 (since length cannot be negative)

So the width would be w = (66/2) - l = 15cm

The area of the rectangle would be lw = 33 x 15 = 495

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E") 1200.
Response 9:
Solution:
Let's assume the length of the rectangular sheet is "L" and the breadth is "B".

When folded along the length of the sheet, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, we can say that,
2L + B = 48 ...(i)

When folded along the breadth of the sheet, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, we can say that,
L + 2B = 66 ...(ii)

Solving equations (i) and (ii), we get:
L = 18 and B = 15

Therefore, the area of the sheet = L x B = 18 x 15 = 270 sq.cm

Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
To solve this question, we first convert the time of 21 minutes to hours by dividing 21 by 60, which gives us 0.35 hours. Then we use the formula distance = speed × time.

On a normal day, Bill's speed is 15 mph, so his distance on a normal day would be:

distance = 15 mph × 0.35 hours = 5.25 miles

On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed on a windy day would be:

15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph

Therefore, his distance on a windy day would be:

distance = 11 mph × 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

So the answer is D) 3.85 miles. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
To solve this problem, first, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours:
21 minutes = 21/60 hours = 0.35 hours

On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced to 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Distance traveled = speed x time
Distance traveled = 11 mph x 0.35 hours
Distance traveled = 3.85 miles

Round to the nearest hundredth:
Answer("D")
Response 6:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours:

21 minutes = 21/60 hours = 0.35 hours

On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Distance = speed x time

Distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Firstly, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours:

21 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.35 hours

On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Distance = Speed x Time

Distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's first convert the time unit from minutes to hours. We know that 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 21 minutes is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

On a normal day, Bill's speed is 15 mph. In 0.35 hours, he can travel:
15 mph x 0.35 hours = 5.25 miles

On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced to 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph. In 0.35 hours, he can travel:
11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

So the answer is D: 3.85 miles.
Response 9:
On a windy day, Bill's speed = 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph
Total time = 21 minutes = 0.35 hours

Response 2:
Let's first find the ratio of red sweets to green sweets in terms of 4 (as there are 4 green sweets for every 3 red sweets). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the ratio by 4: 

Red : Green = 3 : 4  
3x : 4x = 12 : 16  

We know that there are 120 green sweets, which is equal to 16x. Solving for x: 

16x = 120  
x = 7.5  

Now that we know x, we can find the number of red sweets: 

3x = 3(7.5) = 22.5  

However, we can't have half a sweet, so we must round to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 23 red sweets.

Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 12
  C: 16
  D: 24
  E: 25
Response 0:
Let the number of friends be "x" and the amount each person had to contribute before as "y". 

Then, according to the problem: 

xy = 96  -------------- Equation 1
(x-4)(y+4) = 96 ------ Equation 2

Expanding the second equation:

xy + 4x - 4y - 16 = 96  
xy + 4(x-y) = 112

Substituting Equation 1 in the above equation:

96 + 4(x-y) = 112

x-y = 4

Adding this to Equation 1:

xy = 96
x(x-y) = 4x
x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0

We can factorize this quadratic equation as:

(x-12)(x+8) = 0

Since x cannot be negative, the number of friends who attended the picnic was 12.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's consider the original cost per person to be y. So the total number of people who attended the picnic was (96/y).
Now, after four people left, the cost increased by Rs. 4 per person. So the new cost per person was (y+4).
And now the total number of people was ((96/y) - 4).
So we have the equation: y(96/y - 4) = 96
Simplifying, we get: 96 - 4y = 0
So, y = 24
Therefore, the total number of people who attended the picnic would have been (96/24) = 4.
But since 4 people didn't turn up, the actual number of people who attended the picnic was (4-4) + 8 = 8.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's suppose the total number of friends was x.
The cost per person would be 96/x
When 4 friends didn't show up, the cost per person increased by 4, so the new cost per person became (96/x)+4.
So we can calculate the value of x as follows:
96/x = (96/x) + 4
Subtracting 96/x from both sides:
4 = 96/x - 96/x
4 = 96/x^2
x^2 = 96/4
x^2 = 24
x = sqrt(24) = 4.9 (approx.)

Since x represents the total number of friends, it cannot be a decimal. Therefore, we can assume that the answer is the closest integer value which is less than 4.9, which is 4.
So, the number of friends who attended the picnic was:
Total friends - Friends who didn't show up
= x - 4
= 4.9 - 4

  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
To find the minimum number of students in the school, we need to assume all the students who took physics also took math. This gives us a lower bound on the total number of students in the school. 

Let x be the total number of students in the school. We know that 20% of x took physics and 28% of x took math. We also know that all the students who took physics also took math. So:

- Number of students who took physics and math = 20% of x
- Number of students who took only math = 28% - 20% = 8% of x
- Number of students who took neither physics nor math = 100% - 28% = 72% of x

We want to find the minimum value of x, so we assume that all the students who took physics also took math. This means that the number of students who took only math is 8% of x. 

So, the minimum value of x is when the number of students who took only math is minimized. We can do this by assuming that all the remaining students (72% of x) took both math and physics. This gives us:

- Number of students who took physics and math = 20% of x
- Number of students who took only math = 8% of x
- Number of students who took only physics = 0% of x
- Number of students who took neither physics nor math = 72% of x

Adding these up, we get:

0.20x + 0.08x + 0 + 0.72x > 501
0.8x > 501
x > 626.25

The minimum possible value of x is 627, which is greater than all the answer choices. Therefore, the answer is E: none of these.

To find the least possible number of students, we need to maximize the overlap between the two groups (students who took physics and those who took math). One way to do this is to assume that all the students who took physics also took math. This gives us the following inequality:

Number of students who took math >= Number of students who took physics = 0.2 Total number of students

We also know that the number of students who took math is 28% of the total number of students. Putting these together, we get:

0.28 Total number of students >= 0.2 Total number of students
Total number of students >= 0.2 / 0.28 = 5 / 7 * Total number of math students

So the minimum number of students is achieved when 100% of the physics students also took math. In this case, the total number of students is:

Total number of students = Number of math students / 0.28 = 5 / 7 * Number of physics students / 0.28

We want this number to be greater than 501, so:

5 / 7 * Number of physics students / 0.28 > 501
Number of physics students > 501 * 0.28 * 7 / 5
Number of physics students > 985.08

Since the number of students must be an integer, the minimum possible number of students is:

Topic: Math
Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
Let's break down the problem into smaller steps. We need to find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400. 

First, let's find the yearly production cost: 

420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months/year = $554,400/year

Next, let's find the minimum yearly revenue needed to make a profit of $626,400: 

Minimum yearly revenue = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

Finally, let's find the minimum selling price per component: 

Minimum selling price per component = Minimum yearly revenue / Total units produced per year 
= $1,180,800 / (420 units/month x 12 months/year)
= $233.33 

Therefore, the answer is closest to choice A: 226. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let `x` be the selling price per component. 
The yearly revenue from the sales will be 12*420*x = 5040x.
The yearly production cost will be 12*420*110 = 554400.
The yearly profit will be 5040x - 554400.
We want to find the minimum x such that 5040x - 554400 >= 626400.
Simplifying the inequality we get 5040x >= 1180800, which implies x >= 234.
Thus, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Let x be the minimum selling price per component.
The revenue generated by selling one component at price x is x * 420.
In a year, the company will produce and sell 420 * 12 = 5040 components.
The revenue generated by selling 5040 components at price x is 5040x.
The total production cost for 5040 components is 5040 * $110 = $554,400.
Therefore, the yearly profit is 5040x - $554,400.
We need to find the minimum value of x that makes the yearly profit at least $626,400.
So we need to solve the inequality 5040x - $554,400 >= $626,400.
Simplifying the inequality, we get 5040x >= $1,180,800.
Dividing both sides by 5040, we get x >= $234.
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.
Answer: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost:
420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units/year
Production cost = $110/unit
Yearly production cost = 5,040 * 110 = $554,400

To make a yearly profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue must be:
Yearly revenue = 626,400 + 554,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of units produced:
1,180,800 / 5,040 = $234

So the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 be x. 
Revenue per component = x
Profit per component = Revenue per component - Production cost per component = x-110
Number of components produced per year = 420 x 12 = 5,040
Total Revenue per year = Revenue per component x Number of components produced per year = x x 5,040
Total Profit per year = Profit per component x Number of components produced per year = (x-110) x 5,040

Given that Total Profit per year should be at least $626,400. 

Therefore, (x-110) x 5,040 >= 626400

x >= (626400/5040) + 110

x >= 230

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Let's first find the yearly production cost:
Yearly Production Cost = 420 * $110 * 12 = $554,400

Now, let's find the minimum yearly revenue required to have a profit of $626,400:
Minimum Yearly Revenue = Yearly Production Cost + $626,400 = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

Since the company produces and sells 420 units every month, the total number of components produced and sold in a year is 420 * 12 = 5,040

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component required to have a yearly revenue of $1,180,800 is:
Minimum Selling Price = $1,180,800 / 5,040 = $234

Action: Answer("None of the above")  (since none of the choices match with the calculated answer)
Response 6:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost:
Yearly production cost = 12 x 420 x 110 = $554,400

To make a profit of $626,400, the yearly revenue needs to be:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + Desired profit = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly revenue of $1,180,800, we can set up the following equation:
Yearly revenue = Number of units produced x Selling price per unit
$1,180,800 = 420x

Solving for x:
x = $1,180,800 / 420 = $280

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $280.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let's begin by calculating the annual production cost of the company:
Annual production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months = $554,400

Now we can set up the equation for the annual profit:
Annual profit = Annual revenue - Annual production cost

We want the annual profit to be at least $626,400, so we can write:
$626,400 ≤ Annual revenue - $554,400

Adding $554,400 to both sides, we get:
Annual revenue ≥ $1,180,800

Since the company produces 420 units every month, the annual production is 420 x 12 = 5,040 units. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee an annual revenue of at least $1,180,800 is:
Minimum selling price = $1,180,800 ÷ 5,040 units = $234

Action: Answer("None of the above")

Note: The closest answer is (B) 230, but it falls short of the minimum selling price we calculated.
Response 8:
Let P be the selling price per component.
Since the company produces and sells 420 components per month, the monthly profit per component is:
P - 110
Thus, the monthly profit is:
420 * (P - 110)
Multiplying by 12, we get the yearly profit:
12 * 420 * (P - 110) = 5,040P - 2,77200
We want this to be at least 626,400, so we must have:
5,040P - 2,77200 >= 626,400
Solving for P, we get:
P >= (626,400 + 2,77200) / 5,040
P >= 130
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component is $130, which is not among the available choices. Since the closest answer is 240, we select:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's solve this question step by step:

Number of components produced per year = 420 * 12 = 5,040

Production cost per component = $110

Total production cost per year = 5,040 * 110 = $554,400

The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is:

Minimum profit required = $626,400 - $554,400 = $72,000

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component required to achieve this profit is:

Minimum selling price = Total revenue / Number of components

Total revenue = Total cost + Minimum profit required = $554,400 + $72,000 = $626,400

Minimum selling price = 626,400 / 5,040 = $124

Question: If m > 0, y > 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x?
Choices:
  A: y/400
  B: 4y
  C: 50y
  D: 2500/y
  E: 5000/y
Response 0:
We can solve the problem by using algebra. If x is m percent of 4y, then we can write:

x = (m/100) * 4y

To find the percentage of x that m represents, we need to write m as a fraction of x:

m/x = m / [(m/100) * 4y] = 100 / 4y

m/x = 25/y

So, in terms of y, m is 25/y times x. To express this as a percentage of x, we can multiply by 100:

m/x = (25/y) * 100 = 2500/y

Therefore, the answer is D: 2500/y. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
To solve the problem, we need to use the given equation and manipulate it to get m in terms of x and y. Once we have m in terms of x and y, we can find the percentage of m in x. 

Given that x is m percent of 4y, we can write:

x = (m/100) * 4y

Simplifying this equation, we get:

m = (100x)/(4y)

m = (25x)/y

Now we can find the percentage of m in x:

(m/x) * 100

= [(25x)/y] / x *100

= [(25x)/y] * (1/x) * 100

= 2500/y

Therefore, the answer is D: 2500/y.

Response 7:
First, we need to write x in terms of y: 

x = m/100 * 4y

Next, we need to write m as a percentage of x:

m is what percentage of x = m/x * 100

Substitute the value of x from the first equation:

m is what percentage of x = m/(m/100*4y) * 100 = 100/4 = 25

Therefore, m is 25% of x.

Now, we need to write this in terms of y:

m is 25% of x
m = 25/100 * x
m = 25/100 * (m/100 * 4y)
m = 1/16 * y

So, in terms of y, m is (1/16)*100 = 6.25% of x.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") - The correct answer is 6.25% of x, which is not one of the available choices.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
We can start the problem by using the given equation: $x = m\%\times 4y$. We can solve this equation for m by dividing both sides by $4y$ and then multiplying both sides by 100 to convert the decimal into a percentage. 

$m = \dfrac{x}{4y}\times 100$

We can substitute this value of m in terms of x and y into the expression we need to find:

$\dfrac{m}{x}\times 100 = \dfrac{\frac{x}{4y}\times 100}{x} = \dfrac{1}{4y} \times 100 = \dfrac{25}{y}$

Therefore, m is $\dfrac{25}{y}$ percent of x.

Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's denote the number of sales as "x". 

To calculate the salary earned by the salesperson, we multiply the number of sales by the sale price and then multiply the result by the commission rate (10%) as follows: 

Salary = x * 250 * 0.1

We are given that the salesperson wants to earn at least $1000. Therefore, we can set up an inequality as follows:

x * 250 * 0.1 >= 1000

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

x >= 40

This means that the salesperson must make at least 40 sales of $250 each to earn a salary of at least $1000.

Let's assume the salesperson makes "x" sales of $250 each. Then the total commission earned would be:

Total commission = $25 * x

We want to find the value of "x" that makes the total commission at least $1000:

$25 * x ≥ $1000

Dividing both sides by $25, we get:

x ≥ 40

So the salesperson needs to make at least 40 sales in order to earn a commission of at least $1000.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Let's solve the problem step by step. 

First, we know that M is a three-digit number, which can be written as M = 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, N can be written as N = 100c + 10b + a = 10(a+b) + 100c.

Given that M > N, we have 100a + 10b + c > 10(a+b) + 100c, which simplifies to 90a > 99c + 9b. Dividing both sides by 9, we get 10a > 11c + b.

Next, we can substitute M and N in the equation M - N + 396c = 990. We get (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990, which simplifies to 99a + 297c = 990, or a + 3c = 10.

We can use this equation to eliminate a in the previous inequality. Substituting a = 10 - 3c, we get 10(10 - 3c) > 11c + b, which simplifies to b < 31 - 4c.

Since M is a three-digit number, we know that a > 0. Using this condition with the equation a + 3c = 10, we get c > 3. Combining this with the inequality b < 31 - 4c, we get b < 19.

Therefore, the possible values of a, b, and c are: 
- a = 1, 2, 3; 
- b = 0, 1, 2, ..., 18; 
- c = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Out of these values, we need to find how many values of M are more than 300. Since a > 0, we only need to consider a = 1, 2, 3. For each value of a, we can count the number of valid pairs (b, c) that satisfy the inequality b < 19 and the equation a + 3c = 10. 

For a = 1, we have c = 3 and b = 0, 1, 2, ..., 17, which gives us 18 valid pairs. 
For a = 2, we have c = 2 and b = 0, 1, 2, ..., 15, which gives us 16 valid pairs. 
For a = 3, we have c = 1 and b = 0, 1, 2, ..., 11, which gives us 12 valid pairs. 

Therefore, the total number of valid values of M is 18 + 16 + 12 = 46.

Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 240
  C: 30
  D: 60
  E: 120
Response 0:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula:
time = distance ÷ speed

Action: Answer("E") 

Explanation:
Substituting the given values in the formula, we get:
time = 48 miles ÷ 12 miles per hour
time = 4 hours
Converting hours to minutes, we get:
time = 4 hours × 60 minutes per hour
time = 240 minutes
Response 1:
We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Action: Answer("E") 

Explanation: 
time = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour = 4 hours
Convert 4 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:
4 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes.
Response 2:
We can use the formula `time = distance / speed` to solve this problem. The distance is 48 miles and the speed is 12 miles per hour. We convert the speed to miles per minute by dividing by 60: 

`12 miles/hour = 12/60 miles/minute = 0.2 miles/minute`

Now we can plug in the values:

`time = 48 miles / 0.2 miles/minute = 240 minutes`

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 3:
The cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. In 1 hour, the cyclist will travel 12 miles. Therefore, to travel 48 miles, the cyclist will take 4 hours. 

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply 4 hours by 60 minutes per hour. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
We can solve this problem by using the formula:

time = distance / speed

We are given the distance of 48 miles and the speed of 12 miles per hour. We need to find the time in minutes, so we will convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per minute by dividing by 60.

speed = 12 miles/hour = 12/60 miles/minute = 0.2 miles/minute

time = distance / speed = 48 miles / 0.2 miles/minute = 240 minutes

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
The cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. Therefore, the time it will take to travel 48 miles is given by:

time = distance / speed

time = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour = 4 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60.

time in minutes = 4 hours × 60 = 240 minutes

Therefore, 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
To solve the problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed

Action: Answer("E")  
It will take the cyclist 240 minutes (or 4 hours) to travel 48 miles at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
Response 7:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: 
time = distance / speed

Action: Answer("E") 

Explanation:
Substituting the values in the formula, we get:
time = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour = 4 hours

Converting hours to minutes, we get:
time = 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes. Therefore, it will take 240 minutes to travel 48 miles at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
Response 8:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Here, the distance is 48 miles and the speed is 12 miles per hour.

Action: Answer("B") 

The time it will take to travel 48 miles is:
time = distance / speed = 48 / 12 = 4 hours.

To convert hours to minutes, we can multiply by 60:
4 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes. 

Therefore, the answer is B: 240.
Response 9:
To solve this problem we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

We need to convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per minute by dividing by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour.

12 miles per hour = 12/60 miles per minute = 0.2 miles per minute

time = 48 miles / 0.2 miles per minute = 240 minutes

Let us assume that C joined after x months after B joined. 

Then, the profit sharing ratio becomes: 

A:B:C = (40,000 x 12):(60,000 x (12-2)):(120,000 x (12-x))

= 480:480:1440(12-x)

= 1:1:3(12-x)/x

Since we know C’s share, we can write: 

3(12-x)/x = 150,000/375,000

12-x = 4x/5

5x = 60

x = 12

Therefore, C joined the business after 12 months, which is 4 months after B joined.

Choices:

  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let x be the smallest of the k integers. Then the k integers are x, x+1, x+2, ..., x+k-1, and we have:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51

Simplifying the left side gives:

kx + (1+2+...+(k-1)) = 51

kx + (k-1)k/2 = 51

kx + (k^2-k)/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 and rearranging gives:

2kx + k^2 - k - 102 = 0

We can use the fact that x = -50 to solve for k using the quadratic formula:

k = (-(-1) ± sqrt((-1)^2 - 4(2)(-102))) / (2(2)) 

k = (1 ± sqrt(409))/4

Since k must be a positive integer, the only possible value is:

k = (1 + sqrt(409))/4

Answer: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Let's solve the problem using algebra. 

We are given:
- The sum of k consecutive integers is 51, which we can represent as: x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51
- The least integer is -50, which means x = -50

Substituting x in the first equation, we get:
-50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51

Simplifying, we get:
k(-50 - k/2 + 1/2) = 101
- k^2/2 - 49k - 101 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:
k = 9.965 or k = -50.965

Since we're looking for a positive integer value of k, we round up 9.965 to 10. 

Therefore, Action: Answer("A") - 40 - is the closest to our answer.
Response 4:
Let n be the smallest of the k consecutive integers. Then, the sum of the k integers can be written as: n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) + ... + (n + k - 1) = k * n + (1 + 2 + ... + (k - 1)).

Since the first integer is -50, we have n = -50, and the sum of the k consecutive integers is 51, so:

k * (-50) + (1 + 2 + ... + (k - 1)) = 51

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

k * (-50) + (1 + 2 + ... + (k - 1)) = (k * (k - 1)) / 2

Multiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get:

k * (-100 + k - 1) = k * (k - 1)

-100 + k - 1 = k - 1

k = 100

Therefore, there are 100 consecutive integers whose sum is 51, and the answer is:

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let's solve this problem using the given information. 

Let's assume that the k consecutive integers start from x. So, the sum of k consecutive integers can be written as the sum of an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1: 

Sum = (k/2) * [2x + (k - 1) * 1]

We know that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51. So, we can write the following equation: 

51 = (k/2) * [2(-50) + (k - 1) * 1]

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

51 = (-50k + k^2 + k) / 2

Multiplying both sides by 2: 

102 = -50k + k^2 + k

Rearranging the terms: 

k^2 - 49k + 102 = 0

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: 

k = [-(-49) ± sqrt((-49)^2 - 4(1)(102))]/2(1)
k = [49 ± sqrt(2401 - 408)]/2
k = [49 ± sqrt(1993)]/2

Since we are looking for a positive integer value of k, we can discard the negative solution: 

k = [49 + sqrt(1993)]/2 ≈ 44.06

Since k has to be a positive integer, the closest answer choice is (A) 40.

Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
Response 0:
Let the side of the square piece of cloth be x. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the side becomes (x-4). Therefore, the area of the rectangular piece is x(x-4) = x^2 - 4x. 
When we cut this rectangular piece into two triangles, the area of each triangle is (x^2 - 4x)/2. 
Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we have the equation:
(x^2 - 4x)/2 = 70
Simplifying, we get x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0
Factoring, we get (x-14)(x+10) = 0
Since the side of a square cannot be negative, we have x = 14
Therefore, the original perimeter of the square piece of cloth was 4x = 56 feet.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let's say the original side of the square piece of cloth is x. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangle are (x-4) by x. The area of this rectangle is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. 

By cutting the rectangle diagonally in half, we get two right triangles with the legs (x-4) and x. The area of each triangle is (1/2)(x-4)(x) = 70. Solving for x, we get x = 14 feet.

The original perimeter of the square piece of cloth is 4x = 56 feet.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let's consider the original side of the square cloth be "x".
After trimming 4 feet from one edge, we are left with a rectangle of dimensions (x-4) by x.
Using Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the diagonal of the rectangle: sqrt((x-4)^2 + x^2)
Since the rectangle is cut in half to form two triangles, each triangle has an area of (1/2)(x-4)x/2 = 35 square feet.
We can use the area formula of a triangle to find the base and height of each triangle: 
base * height = 2 * 35
base * height = 70
We know that the two triangles are congruent and their bases make up the longer side of the rectangle, so we can find the length of the rectangle:
base * 2 = (x-4)
base = (x-4)/2
height = 70 / base
height = 70 * 2 / (x-4)
The perimeter of the original square cloth would be 4 * x, so we need to substitute for base, height, and x to find the perimeter:
4x = 2(x-4) + 2 * sqrt((x-4)^2 + x^2)
Simplifying and solving for x, we get x = 29.
Therefore, the perimeter of the original square cloth is 4x = 4 * 29 = 116 feet.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let's denote the side length of the original square piece of cloth as "x". 
After trimming 4 feet, we have a rectangle with dimensions of (x-4) by x. 
The area of this rectangle is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. 
We cut this rectangle diagonally into two triangles, each with area 70 square feet.
The area of a triangle is (1/2)base x height, so we have:
(1/2)(x-4)h = 70, where h is the height of each triangle.
Solving for h, we get: h = 140/(x-4)

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x. 
So, we need to express x in terms of h to relate the perimeter to the area of the triangles.
Using the Pythagorean theorem on one of the triangles, we have:
h^2 + [(x-4)/2]^2 = x^2
Simplifying and substituting h = 140/(x-4), we get:
[x^2 - 280x/(x-4) + 112] + [(x-4)/2]^2 = x^2
Simplifying further, we get:
x^2 - 280x/(x-4) + 128 = 0
We can now solve for x using the quadratic formula:
x = [280/(1+sqrt(15))] + 4 [Note: We discard the negative solution since x represents a length]
x = 24.39...
Therefore, the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is approximately 4x = 97.56...

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let x be the length of one side of the original square cloth. After trimming 4 feet, one side of the rectangular piece becomes x-4, and the other side remains x. Using Pythagorean theorem, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular piece is √(x²+(x-4)²). Since the rectangular piece is cut in half to form two congruent triangles, each with an area of 70, we can set up the following equation: 

(1/2)(x)(x-4) = 70

Solving for x, we get x = 10. Thus, the original square cloth was 10 feet by 10 feet. The perimeter is 4x = 40.

Answer("D") 62
Response 7:
Let the original side of the square be x. When 4 feet is trimmed off one edge, we have a rectangle of dimensions x-4 and x. The diagonal of this rectangle (which is also the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by cutting the rectangle in half) is given by 
sqrt[(x-4)^2 + x^2] = sqrt[2x^2 - 8x + 16]. 

Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, the area of the rectangle is 2*70 = 140 square feet. Thus, we have (x-4)*x = 140, which simplifies to x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0. 

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we get x = 14 or x = -10. Since x is the length of a side of a square, it must be positive, so we have x = 14. 

Thus, the perimeter of the original square is 4x = 4*14 = 56 feet.

Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:

  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252

Response 0:
Let's represent the length and width of the parking space by `l` and `w`, respectively. 

We know that the unpainted side has length 9 feet, so we can assume that it is the width `w`. This means that the length `l` is the remaining painted side. 

We are given that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we can set up an equation: 

`l + 2w = 37`

We can solve for `l` in terms of `w`: 

`l = 37 - 2w`

The area of the parking space is then: 

`A = lw = (37 - 2w)(w) = 37w - 2w^2`

To maximize the area, we can take the derivative of `A` with respect to `w` and set it equal to 0: 

`dA/dw = 37 - 4w = 0`

Solving for `w`, we get `w = 9.25`. 

Plugging this back into our expression for `A`, we get: 

`A = 37(9.25) - 2(9.25)^2 = 254.125`

So the area of the parking space is approximately 254.125 square feet. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let the length and width of the rectangular space be L and W respectively. 

We know that the unpainted side (which is a length) is 9 feet, so L = 9.

The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, which means that 2W + L = 37.

Substituting L = 9, we get 2W + 9 = 37, or 2W = 28, or W = 14.

Therefore, the area of the rectangular space is L x W = 9 x 14 = 126 square feet.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's denote the length of the painted sides as x and y, where x is the length of the parking space. Then we can set up two equations based on the given information: 

2x + y = 37 (since two sides are painted, the sum of their lengths is 2x, and one unpainted side has length y)
x + y = 46 (since the length of the unpainted side is 9 and the sum of all three sides is 46)

Solving this system of equations, we get x = 19 and y = 27. Therefore, the area of the parking space is x*y = 19*27 = 513 square feet.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
We can start by using the information given to set up two equations:
Let x be the length of the painted side and y be the width of the parking space.
Then, from the information given, we have:
2x + y = 37  (the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet)
y = 9      (the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet)
We can use the second equation to solve for y:
y = 9
Substituting y = 9 into the first equation, we get:
2x + 9 = 37
2x = 28
x = 14
Now we know that the painted sides are 14 feet and 14 feet, and the unpainted side is 9 feet. So the area of the parking space is:
A = 14 * 9 = 126
Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's assume that the dimensions of the rectangular parking space are length 'L' and width 'W' (in feet). 

From the given information, we know that:
- Length of the unpainted side = 9 feet
- Sum of the lengths of the painted sides = Perimeter of the rectangle = 37 feet

We can use these values to form two equations:
1. 2L + W = 37 (as per the given condition)
2. L + W + 9 = Perimeter of the rectangle (as one side is unpainted)

By substituting the value of the perimeter in the second equation, we get:
L + W + 9 = 2L + 2W
or, L - W = 9  (equation 3, obtained by rearranging terms)

Solving equations (1) and (3), we get:
L = 23. Therefore, W = 7 (using equation 1)

So, the area of the rectangle = L * W = 23 * 7 = 161 square feet

Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
We can begin the problem by using the information given to write two equations involving the length and width of the parking space. Let L be the length of the painted sides, W be the width of the parking lot, and P be the length of the unpainted side. Then we have:

2L + W = 37  (since the sum of the painted sides is 37 feet)
L + 2W = P + L + W = 2L + W + 9 = 37 + 9 = 46 (since the perimeter of the rectangle is the sum of all four sides, and we know the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet)

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

L = 18 - W/2

Substituting this expression for L into the first equation, we get:

2(18 - W/2) + W = 37
36 - W + W = 37
W = 1

Substituting this value of W into the expression for L, we get:

L = 18 - (1/2) = 17.5

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is:

A = L*W = 17.5*1 = 17.5 square feet

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
We can start the problem by using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2(l+w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width. In this case, we know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is P - 9. We also know that this sum is 37 feet. So we have:

P - 9 = 37

Solving for P, we get:

P = 46

Now we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: A = lw, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width. We know that the length is 9 feet, so we have:

A = 9w

To solve for w, we can use the formula for the perimeter: P = 2(l+w). We know that P is 46 feet and l is 9 feet, so we have:

46 = 2(9+w)

Solving for w, we get:

w = 14

Now we can substitute this value into the formula for the area:

A = 9w = 9(14) = 126

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 126 square feet.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the length of the parking space is L and the width is W.
From the problem, we know that 2W + L = 37 (sum of lengths of painted sides) and W = 9 (length of the unpainted side)
Substituting the value of W in the first equation, we get:
2(9) + L = 37
18 + L = 37
L = 19
Therefore, the area of the parking space = L x W = 19 x 9 = 171
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let the width of the parking space be w. Then the length would be (9+w).
According to the problem, the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Therefore, we can write an equation:
2(9+w) + w = 37
Simplifying the equation, we get:
w = 5
So, the width of the parking space is 5 feet, and the length is (9+5) = 14 feet.
Thus, the area of the parking space is A = length x width = 14 x 5 = 70 square feet.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Let the length of the painted sides be 'l' and 'w', where 'l' is the longer side. 
We know, l + 2w = 37 and w = 9. 
Substituting w = 9 in the first equation gives l = 19. 
Area of the rectangle = l*w = 19*9 = 171.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
Choices:
  A: 30 feet
  B: 20 feet
  C: 10 feet
  D: 50 feet
  E: 60 feet
Response 0:
Solution:
Let the length of the yard be x feet.
The total area of the yard is given by Area = length * width
We know that one side of the yard is 100 feet, so we have:
3000 = x * 100
Solving for x, we get: x = 30
Therefore, the length of the yard is 30 feet.
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Solution:
Let's assume one side of the yard is "x" feet. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, and one side is 100 feet wide, so we can write an equation: 

100x = 3000 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 30 

Therefore, the other side of the yard is 30 feet long.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
We can start by using the formula for rectangle area: area = length x width. We know that one side has a width of 100 feet, and the total area is 3,000 square feet. So we can set up the following equation:

3,000 = length x 100

To solve for the length, we can divide both sides by 100:

3,000/100 = length

30 = length

Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's solve this question using the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle:

area = length x width

We know the width is 100 feet, and the total area is 3,000 square feet. So we can write:

3,000 = length x 100

To solve for the length, we divide both sides by 100:

length = 3,000 / 100

length = 30

Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
We can start by using the formula to find the area of a rectangle, which is: Area = Length x Width. We know that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide, so we can substitute that into the formula: Area = Length x 100. We also know that the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, so we can substitute that as well: 3,000 = Length x 100. To solve for Length, we can divide both sides of the equation by 100: Length = 3,000/100 = 30. 

Answer: Answer("A") the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Solution: Let's assume the length of the other side is 'l'.
The formula for the area of a rectangle is A = l * w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

We know that the width is 100 feet, and the area is 3,000 square feet. So we can set up the following equation:

3,000 = l * 100

To solve for l, we can divide both sides of the equation by 100:

3,000/100 = l 

30 = l

So the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

Question: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
Choices:

  C: 12

  E: 3
Response 0:

Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let the rate of hose A be a and the rate of hose B be b. Since the two hoses are working together, their combined rate is a + b. Also, we know that hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1/8.

In the first 2 hours, hose A filled 2/8 = 1/4 of the pool. This means that the remaining 3/4 of the pool is filled by both hoses working together. We can use the formula:

(rate)(time) = work

For the remaining 3/4 of the pool, we have:

(a + b)(3) = 3/4

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3a + 3b = 3/4

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

a + b = 1/4

We know that hose A's rate is 1/8, so we can substitute that in:

1/8 + b = 1/4

Solving for b, we get:

b = 1/4 - 1/8 = 1/8

So, hose B's rate is 1/8. We can now use the formula:

(rate)(time) = work

to find how long it would take for hose B to fill the entire pool:

(1/8)(t) = 1

Solving for t, we get:

t = 8

Therefore, hose B would take 8 hours to fill the entire pool alone.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let X be the time it would have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool. 

To solve the problem, we can use the formula: 

    1 / T = 1 / A + 1 / B

where T is the time taken for A and B to fill the pool working together, A is the time taken for A to fill the pool alone, and B is the time taken for B to fill the pool alone. 

We are given that A = 8. 

For the first 2 hours, A fills: 

    2 / 8 = 1 / 4 

of the pool. 

The remaining pool is filled in 3 hours by A and B working together: 

    3 / (1 / A + 1 / B) = 1 - 1 / 4 
    3 / (1 / 8 + 1 / B) = 3 / 4 
    1 / (1 / 8 + 1 / B) = 1 / 4 
    1 / (B / (8B) + 8 / (8B)) = 1 / 4 
    1 / ((B + 8) / 8B) = 1 / 4 
    (B + 8) / 8B = 4 
    B + 8 = 32B 
    24B = 8 
    B = 1 / 3 

Therefore, hose B working alone would take: 

    1 / (1 / 8 + 1 / (1 / 3)) = 12 

So the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Solution: 
Let's start by finding the fraction of the pool that hose A can fill in one hour. If it takes 8 hours for hose A to fill the pool, that means in 1 hour, Hose A can fill 1/8 of the pool. 
Now, in the first 2 hours, Hose A fills 2/8 = 1/4 of the pool. 
That leaves 3/4 of the pool to be filled by both hoses together. We know that both hoses working together fill the pool in 3 hours. Therefore, the fraction of the pool that both hoses can fill together in 1 hour is 3/4 ÷ 3 = 1/4. 
So, the fraction of the pool that hose B can fill in 1 hour is (1/4) - (1/8) = 1/8.
Therefore, it would take hose B 8 hours to fill the entire pool alone.

Question: Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is?
Choices:
  A: 21
  B: 33
  C: 35
  D: 42
  E: 58
Response 0:
Let the original numbers be 3x and 5x.  When 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9.  Since these are in the ratio 12:23, we have (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23.  Cross-multiplying gives 69x - 207 = 60x - 108.  Solving for x gives x = 99/3 = 33.  Therefore, the smaller original number is 3x = 3(33) = 99.
 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let the numbers be 3x and 5x. After 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9. According to the problem, (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get 69x = 297. Solving for x, we get x = 297/69. Multiplying x by 3, we get the smaller number, which is 9(99/23). Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get: 

Action: Answer("D") 42
Response 2:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x.
Then, (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23.
Solving for x, we get x=69/8.
Therefore, the smaller number (3x-9) is (3*(69/8)-9) = 147/8.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let the two numbers in the ratio 3:5 be 3x and 5x respectively.
Subtracting 9 from each number, we get 3x-9 and 5x-9, respectively.
According to the problem, (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23.
Cross-multiplying, we have 23(3x-9) = 12(5x-9).
This simplifies to 69x - 207 = 60x - 108.
Solving for x, we get x = 9.
Therefore, the smaller number is 3x - 9 = 3(9) - 9 = 18.

Response 4:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. Then, (3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23. Cross-multiplying and solving for x gives x = 23. Therefore, the smaller number is 3x = 3(23) = 69.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let us assume the two numbers are 3x and 5x. According to the problem, if we subtract 9 from each number, we get the ratio of 12:23. So, the equation becomes (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. We can simplify this equation by cross-multiplication as 69x - 36x = 207. Solving this equation, we get x= 7. 
Therefore, the smaller number is 3x = 3(7) = 21.

Response 6:
Let the numbers be 3x and 5x.
After 9 is subtracted from each, we have (3x-9) and (5x-9).
Given that (3x-9) : (5x-9) = 12:23.
Cross-multiplying, we get 23(3x-9) = 12(5x-9).

Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let's use the concept of proportion to solve this problem.

Let's assume the maximum mark M is x.
According to the problem, (504/x) = (420/800)
Simplifying the above equation, we get x = 960

Therefore, the value of M is 960.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Solution:

Let us assume the value of M as "x".

According to the question, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M:

        504 = (504/x) * 100
        5.04x = 50400
        x = 10000

Now, let us consider the second part of the question:

If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks.

        504/x = 420/800
        4.2x = 4032
        x = 960

Therefore, the answer is M = 960.

Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
First we can set up a proportion to solve for M. Let M be the maximum mark and x be the equivalent mark obtained by the candidate after conversion. We can write:

504/M = 420/800

Simplifying this proportion, we can cross-multiply to get:

504 x 800 = 420 x M

Now we can solve for M by dividing both sides by 420:

M = (504 x 800) / 420

M = 960

So the value of M is 960.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
First, we need to find the HCF (highest common factor) of the given numbers to find the 3-digit number N. Then, we can calculate the sum of its digits. 

The HCF of 2272 and 875 is 29. 

To see why, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:

2272 = 29 x 78 + 10
29 = 2 x 10 + 9
10 = 1 x 9 + 1
9 = 9 x 1 + 0

So the remainder is 10 for both divisions, which means N is a factor of 10. We can check 3-digit factors of 10: 100, 200, 250, 500. 

The only option that works is N=250:

2272 ÷ 250 = 9 remainder 22
875 ÷ 250 = 3 remainder 125

Now we can calculate the sum of the digits of N:

2 + 5 + 0 = 7

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 8
  C: 22
  D: 50
  E: 20
Response 0:
Let's denote the entire work as "W". Then Jack can clean W by himself in 12 hours. So, his rate of work is 1/12W per hour. On a particular day, he completed two-thirds of the work. So, the remaining work is (1/3)W.
Now Jill finishes the remaining work. Her rate of work is just 5% of what Jack can do. So, her rate of work is (5/100) x (1/12W) = (1/240W) per hour.
Let's denote the time taken by Jill to finish the remaining work as "t". Then we can set up the equation:
(1/240W) x t = (1/3)W
Simplifying this equation, we get:
t = (1/3) x 240 = 80
Therefore, Jill takes 80 hours to finish the remaining work.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Let's first find out the fraction of work Jill needs to complete: since Jack has already completed 2/3 of the work, Jill needs to complete 1/3 of it.
Let's assume that Jack can complete the whole job in 12 hours. Therefore, Jack's rate of work is 1 yacht per 12 hours, or 1/12 yachts per hour.
Since Jill's rate of work is 5% of Jack's rate, Jill's rate of work is 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 yachts per hour.
Let t be the time, in hours, Jill needs to complete the remaining 1/3 of the job. Then, Jill's total work is 1/3 yachts, and we have:

(1/3) = (1/240) * t

Simplifying the equation above, we get:

t = (1/3) * 240 = 80

Therefore, Jill needs 80 hours to complete the remaining work.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the total work is equivalent to 12 units (since it takes Jack 12 hours to clean a yacht). Therefore, Jack completes 8 units of work (two-thirds of 12 units), and 4 units of work is left. 

If Jill can only clean 5% of what Jack can do, then her rate is 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 of the work per hour. 

To finish 4 units of work at this rate, we can use the formula: time = work/rate
time = 4/(1/240) = 960

Therefore, it takes Jill 960 hours to finish the remaining work.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let the time taken by Jill to clean the remaining work be "t" hours. 

We know that Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, which means his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. 

On this particular day, Jack finished two-thirds of the work, which means he cleaned (2/3) of the yacht. 

Jill cleaned the remaining (1/3) of the yacht. We also know that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of Jack's rate. Therefore, Jill's rate of cleaning is (5/100) x (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour. 

Using the formula "rate x time = work", we can set up the following equation: 

(1/240) x t = (1/3) 

Solving for "t", we get: 

t = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 

Therefore, it takes Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let's assume the total work to be done on the yacht is 6 units (this is an arbitrary value since we don't know the actual size of the yacht). Jack completes 2/3 of the work, which is 4 units (2/3 x 6 = 4). So, the remaining work is 2 units (6 - 4 = 2).
Jack's rate of cleaning is 1/12 units per hour. Let's assume Jill's rate of cleaning is x units per hour. 
We know that Jill's rate is just 5% of what Jack can do, so we can write an equation: x = 0.05/1 x 1/12 = 1/240.
Now we can set up an equation for the remaining work done by Jill. Let t be the time taken by Jill to finish the remaining work in hours.
2 = (1/12)t + (1/240)t
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2 = (13/240)t
t = 2 x (240/13)
t is approximately equal to 37. So, the answer is not one of the available choices.
Response 5:
Let's suppose the total work is 1 (a single job). Jack takes 12 hours to finish the job. On that day, he finishes two-thirds of the job, which means he finishes (2/3)*1 = 2/3 units of work. So, the remaining work would be done on 1/3 units of the job. Jill's rate of working is 5% of what Jack can do. That means Jill can do (5/100)*1 = 1/20 units of work in 1 hour. Let's represent the time Jill takes to finish the remaining work as T. 

To solve the problem, we can use the following formula: Work done = Rate of working * Time spent working.

According to the problem, Jack finishes 2/3 units of work, so the remaining work that Jill has to do is 1/3 units of work. The work of 1/3 units of work is done at a combined rate of Jill and Jack, so:

(2/3) = (1/T) * (1/12) + (1/20) * (1/3)

Simplifying this equation will give us T = 22.

Therefore, Jill takes 22 hours to finish the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's begin by finding out how long it would take Jack to clean the entire yacht on his own. Since he can clean the yacht in 12 hours, we can say that his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. 

Now, if Jack does two-thirds of the work, then the remaining one-third of the work is left for Jill to do. Let's call the time it takes Jill to clean the remaining one-third of the yacht "t". 

Since Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, we can say that her rate of cleaning is 0.05*(1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour. 

Using the formula: rate x time = work, we can set up the following equation for the remaining one-third of the yacht: 

(1/240)*t = (1/3) 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

t = (1/3) * 240 

t = 80 

Therefore, it would take Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let's call the time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work "x". 

First, we need to figure out how much of the work Jack can do in one hour: 
Jack's rate = 1 yacht / 12 hours = 1/12 yacht per hour 

If Jack completed two-thirds of the work, then only one-third of the work is left for Jill to complete: 
Jill's portion of the work = 1/3 yacht 

We also know that Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate: 
Jill's rate = 0.05 * Jack's rate = 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 yacht per hour 

Now we can use the formula: 
rate * time = work 

For Jill, we have: 
(1/240) * x = 1/3 

Solving for x, we get: 
x = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 

So it takes Jill 80 hours to complete the remaining work. 

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's say the entire work will take 12x hours when Jack does it by himself. 
So if Jack does two-thirds of the work, the remaining work will take 4x hours. 
Now Jill does the remaining one-third of the work, which means she will take (1/3)*4x = (4/3)x hours to complete it. 

Let's calculate how long it would take Jack and Jill together to complete the remaining work. 
We know that Jack can finish the work in 12x hours, so in 1 hour he can do 1/12x of the work. 
Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, so in 1 hour she can do 5/100 * 1/12x = 1/240x of the work. 
Together, they can do 1/12x + 1/240x = 25/240x of the work in 1 hour. 

Using the formula, Time = Work/Rate, we can calculate how long it would take Jack and Jill together to complete the remaining work: 
Time = Work/Rate = (4/3)x / (25/240x) = 192/25 hours 

Therefore, Jill would take 192/25 hours to complete the remaining work. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's say the work is to clean one yacht.
Jack takes 12 hours to clean one yacht. So, to finish 2/3 of the work, he needs (2/3) * 12 = 8 hours.
The remaining 1/3 of the work will have to be done by Jill.
Let's say Jill takes x hours to complete the remaining 1/3 work. 

One important thing to note here is that the rate of cleaning of Jill is just 5% of what Jack can do. We can use this information to form an equation.

Jack's rate of cleaning = 1/12 (as he can clean one yacht in 12 hours)
Jill's rate of cleaning = 5% of Jack's rate of cleaning = (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240

Using the rates, we can form an equation as follows:
(2/3)/12 + (1/3)/x = 1

Simplifying this equation, we get:
x = 20

Therefore, Jill will take 20 hours to complete the remaining 1/3 of the work.

Question: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 3
  C: 2
  D: 1
  E: 0
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A") 

There are different ways to approach the problem, but one possible method is to use algebra. Let's call the number of copper coins "x" and the number of brass coins "y". Then we can write two equations based on the information given:

- 20x is the total amount earned from the copper coins.
- 25y is the total amount earned from the brass coins.

We also know that the total amount earned is $3.40, so we can write another equation:

- 20x + 25y = 340 (in cents)

Now we can try to solve for x by substitution or elimination. For example, if we multiply the first equation by 5, we get:

- 100x + 125y = 0

Then we can subtract this equation from the third equation to eliminate y:

- 20x + 25y - (100x + 125y) = 340 - 0
- -80x = -340
- x = 4.25

Uh-oh, x is not an integer, which doesn't make sense for the number of coins. This means that we made a mistake somewhere, probably in assuming that all the coins were brought up in one dive. In fact, we don't know anything about the number of dives or the ratio of copper to brass coins per dive. Therefore, the most likely answer is "None of the Above".
Response 1:
Let's assume the number of copper coins as "x", and the number of brass coins as "y". From the question, we can form two equations:

Equation 1: 20x + 25y = 340 (as she got $3.40 in total)
Equation 2: Value of x should be minimum

To solve the above equations, we need to minimize the value of x while keeping the value of y as an integer. It is given that the value of y can be any integer (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).

If we start by assuming x=0 (i.e., she didn't bring any copper coin), then the equation becomes:

20(0) + 25y = 340
y = 13.6

However, the value of y must be an integer, which is not the case here. So we need to increase the value of x to get an integer value of y.

If we assume x=1, then the equation becomes:

20(1) + 25y = 340
25y = 320
y = 12.8

Again, y is not an integer. We need to increase x further. 

If we assume x=2, then the equation becomes:

20(2) + 25y = 340
25y = 300
y = 12

Now, y is an integer. Thus, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 2.

Response 7:
We can solve this problem using algebra. Let's denote the number of copper coins as "c" and brass coins as "b". From the problem, we know that:

- The amount earned from copper coins is 20c cents
- The amount earned from brass coins is 25b cents
- The total amount earned is $3.40 or 340 cents

We can write these as equations:

20c + 25b = 340   (equation 1)

We also know that the diver can only bring back whole coins, so c and b must be integers. We want to find the minimum number of copper coins, which means we want to minimize c. We can use trial and error to find a solution that satisfies all the conditions. 

If we start with c = 0, then equation 1 becomes:

25b = 340

This does not give an integer solution for b, so we need to try c = 1:

20 + 25b = 340

25b = 320

b = 12.8

This also does not give an integer solution for b, so we need to try c = 2:

40 + 25b = 340

25b = 300

b = 12

This gives an integer solution for b, so the minimum number of copper coins is 2.

Question: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.
Choices:
  A: 368
  B: 377
  C: 288
  D: 997
  E: 112
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let the number be $100a+10b+c$. We know that $a + b + c = 17$ and $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109$.
Upon factoring $100a+10b+c-495$ as $100a + 10b + c - 500 + 5$, we notice that this expression is equal to $100c+10b+a$, and so
\[100c+10b+a = 100a+10b+c-495\]
\[99a - 99c = 990\]
\[a-c=10.\]
Now we know $a+c = 17$ and $a-c=10$. Solving this system gives $a =\frac{27}{2}$ and $c = \frac{7}{2}$.
This is impossible since $a$ and $c$ are integers. Therefore, none of the answer choices is correct.
Response 3:
Let us assume the hundreds, tens and units digit be x, y, and z respectively. Therefore, the original number is 100x + 10y + z. We have two equations:  x + y + z = 17 and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109. 

Subtracting 495 from the original number, we have 100x + 10y + z - 495 = 100z + 10y + x. Simplifying, we get 99x - 99z = 495, which gives us x - z = 5.

We can now solve the two equations x + y + z = 17 and x - z = 5 to get x = 6, y = 3, and z = 8. Thus, the original number is 638.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
We can begin by writing out all the three digit numbers whose digits sum to 17. We can then use the given information to eliminate the numbers that don't satisfy all the conditions of the problem until we are left with the answer.

Let x, y, and z be the hundreds, tens, and units digits respectively. We know that:

x + y + z = 17        (Equation 1)
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109 (Equation 2)

From Equation 1, we can see that x cannot be 1 since y and z would have to sum to 16, which is impossible since they are digits. The smallest value x can take is 2. From Equation 2, we can see that the digits of the number must be less than or equal to 3 since 4^2 = 16, which means that if any digit is 4 or greater, the sum of the squares of the digits would be greater than 109.

So let's try all the possible values of x:

If x = 2, then y + z = 15 from Equation 1. The only possible pairs of digits that sum to 15 and have a sum of squares equal to 109 are (8,7) and (9,6). We can eliminate (8,7) since 2^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 = 117. So the only possible value for the number is 287.

If x = 3, then y + z = 14 from Equation 1. The only possible pairs of digits that sum to 14 and have a sum of squares equal to 109 are (9,5) and (8,6). We can eliminate (9,5) since 3^2 + 9^2 + 5^2 = 115. So we are left with (8,6), which means that the number is 386.

Therefore, the answer is 386.

Answer("C")
Response 5:
First, we know that the sum of the digits is 17. This means that the digits of the number could be 8, 9, and 0 or 7, 9, and 1. However, the sum of the squares of the digits is 109, which only occurs if the digits are 7, 9, and 1. 

Let the number be 719. If we subtract 495 from it, we get 224. Reversing the digits of 224 gives us 422, which has the same digits as 719. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
We can approach this question using algebra. Let the hundreds, tens and units digits of the number be represented by $x$, $y$ and $z$, respectively. Therefore, we have:
$x + y + z = 17$ (equation 1)
$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109$ (equation 2)
The number can be expressed as $100x + 10y + z$. When we subtract 495 from the number, we get:
$100x + 10y + z - 495 = 100z + 10y + x$
Simplifying this expression, we get:
$99x - 99z = 495$
Dividing both sides by 99, we get:
$x - z = 5$ (equation 3)

From equations 1 and 3, we can find that $2y + 5 = 17$, which means $y = 6$. Substituting this value in equations 1 and 2, we get:
$x + 6 + z = 17$
$x^2 + 36 + z^2 = 109$

Simplifying these equations, we get:
$x + z = 11$ (equation 4)
$x^2 + z^2 = 73$ (equation 5)

We can now solve equations 4 and 5 simultaneously. From equation 4, we have $z = 11 - x$, and substituting this in equation 5, we get:
$x^2 + (11 - x)^2 = 73$
Simplifying this equation yields:
$2x^2 - 22x + 40 = 0$
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
$x^2 - 11x + 20 = 0$
Solving this quadratic equation gives $x = 1$ or $x = 10$. We can discard $x = 10$, since the number is a three digit number. Therefore, we have $x = 1$ and $z = 10$. The number is:
$100(1) + 10(6) + 10 = 160 + 10 = 170$

Lastly, we verify that the number obtained by subtracting 495 from 170 and reversing the digits is indeed the same as the original number. We have:
$170 - 495 = -325$
Reversing the digits, we get:
$-325 \rightarrow -523$
Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A") 

The sum of the digits is 17, so we know that the number is $100a+10b+c$, where $a+b+c=17$. We are also told that $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. 

If we subtract 495 from the number, then we get $(100a+10b+c)-495=100c+10b+a$, which is the number with the digits in reverse order. Simplifying this equation, we get $99a-99c=495$, or $a-c=5$. 

There are not too many possibilities for $a$ and $c$ that satisfy $a-c=5$ and $a+b+c=17$. Trying a few cases, we find that $(a,b,c)=(9,5,3)$ works. 

Therefore, the original number is $100a+10b+c=100(9)+10(5)+3=\boxed{368}$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
We begin by expressing the three-digit number as 100a + 10b + c. From the problem, we know that a + b + c = 17 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109. 
We also know that if we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number with the same digits written in reverse order:
100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a.
Simplifying this expression gives 99a - 99c = 495, or a - c = 5. 

We can now use the equation a + b + c = 17 and the fact that a - c = 5 to solve for a, b, and c. 
Substituting c = a - 5 into a + b + c = 17 gives a + b + (a - 5) = 17, or 2a + b = 22. 
We can also substitute c = a - 5 into a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 to get a^2 + b^2 + (a - 5)^2 = 109. 
Expanding the square gives 2a^2 - 10a + b^2 = 134. 

We can now use the equations 2a + b = 22 and 2a^2 - 10a + b^2 = 134 to solve for a, b, and c. 
Rearranging 2a + b = 22 gives b = 22 - 2a, which we can substitute into 2a^2 - 10a + b^2 = 134 to get:
2a^2 - 10a + (22 - 2a)^2 = 134.
Expanding and simplifying gives a^2 - 4a - 9 = 0, which factors as (a - 1)(a - 3) = 0. 
Therefore, a = 1 or a = 3. 

If a = 1, then b = 20 - 2a = 18 and c = a - 5 = -4, which is not a digit. Therefore, a = 3, b = 16, and c = -2. 
We made an error in our working, so we can conclude that none of the choices are correct.

  B: 300
  C: 280
  D: 320
  E: 315
Response 0:
Solution:
Let's assume the cost price of the article is x.
Profit Percent = 20%
Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
360 = x + (20% of x)
360 = x + 0.2x
1.2x = 360
x = 300

Solution: 

Let the cost price of the article be x.

Since the trader sold the article at a profit of 20%, the selling price is 120% of the cost price.

Selling Price = 120% of Cost Price
360 = 120/100 * x
360 = 6/5 * x
x = 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Solution: 

Let the cost price of the article be "x".

It is given that the trader sold the article at a profit of 20%. 

Profit = 20% of cost price = 20% of x = (20/100)*x = 0.2x

Selling price = Cost price + Profit

360 = x + 0.2x

360 = 1.2x

x = 360/1.2

x = 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

Question: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 30
  C: 45
  D: 60
  E: 75
Response 0:
Let's assume that the hotel buys "x" newspapers on Monday.
From the given information, we can set up the following equation:
2(4) x + 5(1) x = 210
Simplifying the equation, we get:
8 x + 5 x = 210
13 x = 210
x = 16.15 (rounded off to the nearest whole number)
Therefore, the hotel buys approximately 16 newspapers on Monday.

Response 6:
Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday.
Then, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday.
It buys (7-1) = 6x newspapers the other 6 days of the week combined.
So, the total cost is:
4(2x) + 1(x+6x) = 210
8x + 7x = 210
15x = 210
x = 14
Therefore, the hotel buys 14 newspapers on Monday.
 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's start the problem as follows:
Let's say the number of newspapers bought during the rest of the days of the week is 'x'.
Then the number of newspapers bought on Sunday is '2x' as they bought twice as many as the rest of the days combined.
Given that the hotel orders newspapers worth $210 for a week, we can write the following equation to calculate the value of 'x':
4(2x)+1(x*6) = 210
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
9x = 194
x = 21.55
So, the hotel buys about 21 newspapers on Monday.
As we cannot select a fractional number, we can select the nearest answer in this case, which is:

Topic: Math
Question: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
Choices:
  A: 144km
  B: 72 km
  C: 126km
  D: 84 km
  E: 48km
Response 0:
Let's assume the distance between X and Y is "d".
After meeting for the first time, let's assume that they both travelled "x" km. Therefore, Allen still has "d-x" km to travel and Bob has "d+x" km to travel.
Let's calculate the time it takes for them to meet for the first time:
time = distance / speed
time taken by Allen = x/54
time taken by Bob = x/78
As they both started at the same time, the time taken by Allen = time taken by Bob
x/54 = x/78
Solving for "x", we get x = (54*78) / (78+54) = 28.8 km

After meeting for the second time (when Allen starts from Y and Bob starts from X):
Let's assume that they both travelled "y" km before meeting for the second time.
Therefore, Allen travelled a total of (x + (d-x) + y) = (d+y) km
Bob travelled a total of (x + (d+x) + y) = (2d + y) km
We are given that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen when they meet for the second time.
2d + y = (d+y) + 48
d = 48 km

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 48 km.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let us consider the distance between X and Y as 'd'
When Allen and Bob meet for the first time, let us say they meet at point Z. Let the distance between Z and Y be 'x' km.
At the time of their first meeting, let 't' hours have elapsed. So, we can say:
Allen has traveled a distance of 54t km
Bob has traveled a distance of 78t km
Total distance traveled by both of them = d
As they started simultaneously, the total time taken by both of them to meet for the first time can be given by:
t = (d + x) / (54 + 78)
Now, from the problem statement, we know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time. So, by the time they meet for the second time, Bob would have traveled a distance of:
78t + 48 km
And, Allen would have traveled a distance of:
54t - 48 km
Now, let's find the distance between Z and X:
Distance between Z and X = d - x
Total distance traveled by both of them from their first meeting point until their second meeting point = (78t + 48) + (54t - 48) = 132t km
The time taken by both of them to meet for the second time = (d - x) / (54 + 78)
We know that the distance covered by Bob by the time they meet for the second time is 48 km more than that of Allen. So, we can say:
78t + 48 = 54t - 48 + 48
24t = d - x
Substituting the value of 't' in the above equation, we get:
24[(d + x) / (54 + 78)] = d - x
Simplifying this, we get:
d = 126 km

Answer: Answer("C") - 126km
Response 2:
Let the distance between X and Y be D. Let's assume they meet for the second time at point Z. From X to Y they travel a distance of D, so both Allen and Bob have traveled a distance of D when they meet for the first time at point Y. Let's assume this point as Z'.

When Allen and Bob meet at point Z, the distance traveled by Allen from Y to Z is equal to the distance traveled by Bob from X to Z. Let's assume the distance traveled by Allen from Y to Z be d. Therefore, the distance traveled by Bob from X to Z is (D - d).

Time taken by Allen to travel distance d at 54kmph is given as t1 = d/54.
Time taken by Bob to travel distance (D - d) at 78kmph is given as t2 = (D - d)/78.

As per the question, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen at the time of their second meeting at point Z. So, we can write the following equation:

78 * t2 = 54 * (t1 + t2) + 48
78 * ((D - d)/78) = 54 * (d/54 + (D - d)/78) + 48
D - d = 24

Now, we can write another equation using the distance formula:

d + (D - d) + (D - d) = D
D = 144

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 144 km.

Hence, the answer is A.
Response 3:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken for them to meet the first time be t hours. The distance that Bob traveled more than Allen is equal to the distance between them when they meet for the second time. 

We can begin by using the formula distance = speed x time to get two different expressions for the distance between X and Y:

Distance traveled by Allen = 54t + 54t = 108t
Distance traveled by Bob = 78t + 78t = 156t

We know that these distances differ by 48 km, so:

156t - 108t = 48
48t = 48
t = 1

So they met for the first time after 1 hour. At this time, Allen had traveled 54 km and Bob had traveled 78 km.

When they meet for the second time, they will have covered the entire distance between X and Y. The distance traveled by Allen will be equal to half of the total distance:

Distance traveled by Allen = (1/2)d

The distance traveled by Bob will be equal to the total distance minus the distance that Allen has traveled:

Distance traveled by Bob = d - (1/2)d = (1/2)d

We also know that Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen at this point:

(1/2)d - (1/2)d = 48

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is:

d = 48 km x 2 = 96 km

Answer: Answer("None of the Above") - The answer is not one of the choices given.
Response 4:
Let the distance between X and Y be d km. 

Let's consider the time taken for them to meet for the first time. Let t be this time in hours. 

In time t, Allen travels a distance of 54t km and Bob travels a distance of 78t km. 

Since they meet each other, the sum of the distances they have traveled is equal to d: 

54t + 78t = d 

132t = d 

t = d/132 

Now let's consider the time taken for them to meet for the second time. Let T be this time in hours. 

In time T, Allen would have traveled a distance of 54T km from Y towards X, and Bob would have traveled a distance of 78T km from X towards Y. 

When they meet for the second time, the distance covered by Bob is 48 km more than the distance covered by Allen. 

So, 

78T = 54T + 48 

24T = 48 

T = 2 

Therefore, they meet for the second time after 2 hours. 

We know that Allen travels from Y to X and back to Y, so he covers a total distance of 2*54 = 108 km in 2 hours. 

Bob travels from X to Y and back to X, so he covers a total distance of 2*78 = 156 km in 2 hours. 

Since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, the distance between X and Y is 

108 + 48 = 156 - 48 = 108*2 = 216 km 

Answer: Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let the distance from X to Y be "d". 
Let "t" be the time it takes for Allen and Bob to meet for the first time.
Let "T" be the time it takes for Allen and Bob to meet for the second time (when Bob covers 48 km more than Allen).

During the first meeting, the total distance they cover is "d", since they are both moving towards each other. Therefore, we can write the equation: 

54t + 78t = d 

Simplifying, we get: 

t = d / 132 

During the second meeting, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds, since they are moving in opposite directions. Allen covers half the distance, so we can write the equation: 

54T = (d/2) 

Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, so: 

78T = (d/2) + 48 

Substitute T = (d / 108) (from the first equation) in the above two equations, solve for d and you get:

Action: Answer("A") 144km
Response 7:
Let's call the distance between X and Y as "d".
Let's also assume that they meet for the second time after time "t".
In the first leg of the journey, Allen travels a distance of d/2 km towards Y.
In the same time, Bob covers (3/4)d km towards X.
So they meet for the first time at a distance (d/2) + (3/4)d = 5d/4 from X.
In the second leg of the journey, Allen travels from Y to (d/2) km back towards X.
This means Allen covers a total distance of (2d/2) = d km.
Bob, on the other hand, covers (3/4)d km to reach X and then (3/4)d km back towards Y.
So Bob covers a total distance of (3/4)d + (3/4)d = (3/2)d km.
Given that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time, we can set up the following equation:
(3/2)d - 48 = d
Solving for "d", we get d = 144 km.
Therefore, the answer is (A) 144 km.
Response 8:
First, let's find the ratio of the speeds of Allen and Bob. The ratio of their speeds is 54:78, which simplifies to 3:4. This means that for every 3 km Allen travels, Bob travels 4 km. 

Let's say the distance between X and Y is d km. When they first meet, let's say they meet at a distance of x km from X. This means that Bob has traveled (d - x) km. 

For them to meet for the second time, Allen would have traveled a total of (2d - x) km. Bob would have traveled a total of [(d - x) + (d + 48)] km, since he covers an additional 48 km more than Allen. 

Since they are traveling towards each other, the sum of the distances they each travel is equal to the total distance between X and Y: 

(2d - x) + [(d - x) + (d + 48)] = d 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

4d - 2x + 48 = d 

3d = 2x - 48 

When they first meet, their combined distance is d - x: 

d - x = 3/7 * d 

Substituting 3/7 * d for d - x in the equation above: 

3d = 2x - 48 

3/7 * d = 2x/7 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: 

d/7 = 2x/21 + 16 

We can substitute 3/7 * d for d/7: 

3/7 * d = 2x/21 + 16 

Multiplying both sides by 21: 

6/7 * d = 2x + 336 

Substituting 3/7 * d for d - x in the equation d - x = 3/7 * d: 

x = 4/7 * d 

Substituting 4/7 * d for x in the equation above: 

6/7 * d = 2(4/7 * d) + 336 

6/7 * d = 8/7 * d + 336 

Subtracting 8/7 * d from both sides: 

-2/7 * d = 336 

Dividing both sides by -2/7: 

d = 1008 

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 1008 km.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
Response 0:
Solution:
Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep in the forward journey is "x" km
Then, the speed of the jeep in the forward journey = Distance travelled/Time taken = x/6
During the return journey, the speed of the jeep increased by 12km/hr. Hence, the speed of the jeep in the return journey = (x/4) + 12
We know that Distance = Speed x Time
Therefore, distance covered in forward journey = x = (x/4 + 12) * 4
x = x + 48
Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep in the forward journey is 48km.
Hence, the answer is Answer("None of the Above") since none of the choices match the calculated distance.
Response 1:
Solution:
Let the distance travelled by the jeep be "d" km and speed be "x" km/hr.
Given, time taken during forward journey = 6 hours
Therefore, d = 6x         ---(1)
Given, speed during return journey = x+12 km/hr
Time taken during return journey = 4 hours
Therefore, d = 4(x+12)    ---(2)
Equating (1) and (2), we get:
6x = 4(x+12)
Solving the above equation, we get:
x = 18 km/hr
Substituting x = 18 in equation (1), we get:
d = 6x = 6*18 = 108 km

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
We can solve this problem using the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

Let's assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is S km/hr, and the distance it travels is D km. Then, we have:

D = S x 6   ...(1)

During the return journey, the speed of the jeep is increased by 12km/hr, so its speed becomes (S + 12) km/hr. The distance it travels is the same, i.e. D km. Therefore, we have:

D = (S + 12) x 4   ...(2)

From equations (1) and (2), we can solve for D as follows:

S x 6 = (S + 12) x 4

6S = 4S + 48

2S = 48

S = 24

Substituting S = 24 in equation (1), we get:

D = 24 x 6 = 144 km

Therefore, the jeep travelled a distance of 144 km.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 3:
We can begin the problem by using the formula:
distance = speed × time

Let's let 'd' be the distance of the journey (in km), and 's' be the speed of the jeep on the forward journey (in km/hr).

From the problem, we know that:

distance = speed × time

Using this formula for both the forward and return journeys, we can create two equations:

Forward journey: d = s × 6
Return journey: d = (s + 12) × 4

Now we can solve for 'd' by setting the two equations equal to each other:

s × 6 = (s + 12) × 4

Simplifying and solving for 's', we get:

s = 36 km/hr

Now we can substitute 's' into one of the equations for distance to find the distance of the journey:

d = s × 6
d = 36 × 6
d = 216 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 216 km.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Solution: 

Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep as 'd' and the speed of the jeep on the forward journey as 's'

During the forward journey,
Distance = Speed x Time
d = s x 6

During the return journey, 
Speed = s + 12km/hr (as it increased its speed by 12km/hr)
d = (s+12) x 4

We need to find the value of 'd' from the above two equations.

Solving both the equations, we get:

d = 3/2 x (s+12) x 4

d = 6s

Equating both equations we get, 

3/2 x (s+12) x 4 = 6s

On solving the above equation, we get 

s = 24 km/hr 

Substituting the value of s in equation (1), we get 

d = 6s = 6 x 24 = 144 km

Answer: Answer("B") 144km
Response 5:
Solution: 

Let the distance travelled by the jeep be x.

During the forward journey, 

speed = distance / time = x / 6

During the return journey, 

speed = distance / time = x / 4

Given that the return speed is 12 km/hr more than the forward speed.

Therefore, x/4 = (x/6) + 12

Solving the above equation, we get x = 144.

Answer: Answer("B") 
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Solution:
Let us assume that the jeep travels at a speed of x km/hr forward.
Then, the jeep travels the same distance at a speed of (x+12) km/hr in the return journey.
Let's use the formula, distance = speed × time
According to the problem, we have:
Distance covered in forward journey = Distance covered in return journey
x × 6 = (x+12) × 4
6x = 4(x+12)
6x = 4x + 48
2x = 48
x = 24
Hence, the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is 24 km/hr
So, the distance travelled by the jeep = speed × time = 24 × 6 = 144 km

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Solution:

Let's call the one-way distance as "d".

Let's also call the speed during the forward journey as "s".

According to the problem, we have the following information:

Forward journey:
time = 6 hours
speed = s
distance = d

Return journey:
time = 4 hours
speed = s + 12 km/hr
distance = d

We know that:
distance = speed x time

Using this formula, we can write two equations:
d = s x 6  (equation 1)
d = (s + 12) x 4  (equation 2)

We can solve for "s" by simplifying equation 2 and substituting it into equation 1:

4s + 48 = 6s
2s = 48
s = 24

Now that we know "s", we can use equation 1 to find "d":
d = s x 6
d = 24 x 6
d = 144 km

Topic: Math
Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 28
  C: 30
  D: 53
  E: 59
Response 0:
Let x be the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies with 64 initial lilies.
After 60 days, the number of lilies on the lake is 2^30 since the number of lilies doubles every 2 days.
We can write an equation using the given information and solve for x:
2^x = 2^30/64
2^x = 2^25
x = 25
Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 25 + 2 = 27 days.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's start with the initial number of water lilies on the lake, which is 64. We can find out how many doublings are needed to reach the fully covered state by dividing the final number of water lilies (2^x where x is the number of doublings) by the initial number of water lilies (64).

2^x / 64 = final number of doublings needed

Also, we know that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies when there is one water lily. Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, after t days, the number of water lilies on the lake is 2^(t/2). Therefore, when the lake is fully covered with water lilies, we have:

2^(60/2) = 2^30 = final number of water lilies

Now we can find the number of doublings needed to reach this final number of water lilies:

2^x / 64 = 2^30
2^x = 2^30 * 64
2^x = 2^35
x = 35

So it takes 35 doublings, or 70 days (since each doubling takes 2 days), for the lake to be fully covered with lilies when there are initially 64 water lilies on it.

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's assume that the lake will be fully covered with water lilies after "x" days, then we can set up the equation below based on the given information:
    
    2^(60/2) = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 (total number of water lilies after 60 days)
    
    1 * 2^x = 64
    
    2^x = 2^6
    
    x = 6

Action: Answer("6")
Response 4:
Let the initial number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies be x. Then we know that:

2^(60/x) = 2^x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

60/x = x

x^2 = 60

x ≈ 7.75

So if initially there were 64 water lilies, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in approximately 7.75 * 2 = 15.5 days.

Rounding to the nearest integer, we get 16.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's call the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies "x". 

The number of lilies doubles every two days, so after x days there will be 2^(x/2) lilies on the lake. 

We know that when x=60, there is exactly one lily on the lake to start with, so we can set up the equation:

1 * 2^(x/2-30) = 64

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2^(x/2-30) = 64

2^(x/2) = 2^36

x/2 = 36

x = 72

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
We can use the formula $N = N_0\times 2^{t/h}$, where $N$ is the final number of water lilies, $N_0$ is the initial number of water lilies, $t$ is the time elapsed, $h$ is the time it takes for the population to double. We can solve for $t$ by setting $N$ to the final number of water lilies, $2^{30}$, and $N_0$ to 64. Then we have:

$2^{30} = 64\times 2^{t/2}$

$2^{30} = 2^6\times 2^{t/2}$

$2^{30} = 2^{t/2 + 6}$

$t/2 + 6 = 30$

$t/2 = 24$

$t = 48$

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 48 days.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Let's first calculate the number of doublings required for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies:
1. Starting with 1 lily, it takes 2 days to have 2 lilies.
2. With 2 lilies, it takes another 2 days to have 4 lilies.
3. With 4 lilies, it takes another 2 days to have 8 lilies.
4. With 8 lilies, it takes another 2 days to have 16 lilies.
5. With 16 lilies, it takes another 2 days to have 32 lilies.
6. With 32 lilies, it takes another 2 days to have 64 lilies.
7. With 64 lilies, it takes another 2 days to have 128 lilies, which is enough to fully cover the lake.

So, it takes 6 doublings for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, which means it takes 2 x 6 = 12 days for the lake to be fully covered starting from 1 lily.

Now, let's calculate the number of days required to fully cover the lake starting from 64 lilies.
1. It takes 2 days for the lilies to double to 128.
2. From 128, it takes another 2 x 5 = 10 days to double 5 times and have 128 x 2^5 = 4096 lilies.

So, starting from 64 lilies, it takes 2 + 10 = 12 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.

Topic: Math
Question: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?
Choices:
  A: 40.8
  B: 41.6
  C: 42.2
  D: 43.5
  E: 44.8
Response 0:
Let the weight of the new heavy-duty truck be x. 

Then, the sum of the weights of all 10 vehicles before the new truck was added is 12.2 x 10 = 122 tons. 

After the new truck was added, the sum of the weights of all 11 vehicles became (12.2 x 10 + x) = 134.2 + x tons. 

The new average weight of the 11 vehicles is given to be 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons. 

So, we have the equation: 

(122 + x + 2.6)/11 = 14.8 

Solving for x, 

122 + x + 2.6 = 11 x 14.8 

x = 41.6 

Therefore, the weight of the new heavy-duty truck is 41.6 tons.

Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let's represent the weight of the heavy duty truck by X. 

We can start by using the formula for the arithmetic mean:
Average = (Sum of all weights) / (Number of vehicles)

We know that the group initially had 10 vehicles with an average weight of 12.2 tons. Thus, we can write:

12.2 = (Sum of weights of 10 vehicles) / 10

which simplifies to:

Sum of weights of 10 vehicles = 122 tons

After the new truck is added, the group now has 11 vehicles and an increased average weight of 14.8 tons. We can set up another equation using the same formula for the arithmetic mean:

14.8 = (Sum of weights of 11 vehicles) / 11

which simplifies to:

Sum of weights of 11 vehicles = 162.8 tons

We know that the sum of weights of the initial 10 vehicles was 122 tons, so the weight of the new truck X can be found by:

Sum of weights of 11 vehicles = Sum of weights of 10 vehicles + Weight of new truck

162.8 = 122 + X

Solving for X, we get:

X = 40.8

Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 40.8 tons.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let x be the weight in tons of the new heavy duty truck.
The total weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the new truck is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.
After adding the truck, the new total weight becomes 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons (since the average increased by 2.6 tons).
Therefore, the weight of the new heavy duty truck x = 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let 'x' be the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck. 
To find the answer, we can use the formula for the arithmetic mean:
(sum of weights) / (number of vehicles) = average weight
(10 * 12.2) + x = 11 * (12.2 + 2.6)
122 + x = 11*14.8
x = 44.8

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let's start by assuming Joe's current age is J, his sister's age is S and his father's age is F. 

We know that J + S + F = 100 (given)

We are also given that when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice her current age. This means that:
J + F = 2(S)  or  J = 2S - F

We are also given that when Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice older than when his sister was as old as his father. This can be expressed as:
F + J = 2(S + F - S)
J + F = 2F - 2S
J = F - 2S

Now we can substitute the third equation into the second equation to get:
2S - F = F - 2S
4S = 2F
F = 2S

Substituting the value of F into the first equation, we get:
J + S + F = 100
J + S + 2S = 100
J + 3S = 100
J = 100 - 3S

Substituting the value of J and F into the third equation, we get:
J = 2S - F
100 - 3S = 2S - 2S
100 - 3S = 0
S = 100/3

Finally, substituting the value of S into the equation for F we get:
F = 2S = 200/3

Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 200/3.

Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above
Response 0:

Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let's call the distance between A and B as "d". Let's also call the time it took for Kevin to drive from A to B as "t". 

We know that the distance from B to where Kevin was 3 hours before the end of his trip is also "70 miles". 

From the given information, we can set up the following equation: 

d/70 + (d/90) + 3 = t 

We have two unknowns here - "d" and "t". But we can use another piece of information to eliminate "t". 

We know that the time it took for Kevin to drive from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph is the same as the time it took for him to return to A at a constant speed of 90 mph (since the distance is the same). 

So, we can write another equation: 

d/70 = d/90 + 3 

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for "d". 

Multiplying the second equation by 630 (the least common multiple of 70 and 90) gives: 

9d = 7d + 1890 

2d = 1890 

d = 945 

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 945 miles. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Solution:

Let the distance between A and B be x. 

Let's find the time Kevin spent driving from A to B and back to A.

Time spent from A to B = Distance / Speed = x / 70
Time spent from B to A = Distance / Speed = x / 90 

Total time spent = x/70 + x/90 

We know that Kevin was 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before the end of his trip. 

This means that he spent x-70 miles of his trip before turning back, and x-70 miles after turning back. 

The time taken to travel the first x-70 miles was (x-70)/70. 
The time taken to travel the last x-70 miles was (x-70)/90. 

Adding these two times to the time spent on the return trip gives us the total travel time: 

Total time = (x-70)/70 + x/90 + (x-70)/90

We also know that this total travel time is 3 hours less than the total time it would take to travel x miles at 90 mph: 

Total time = x/90 - 3

Equating the two expressions for total time, we get:

(x-70)/70 + x/90 + (x-70)/90 = x/90 - 3

Simplifying this equation gives us: 

x = 360 

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let d be the distance between A and B.
Let t be the time it takes Kevin to travel from A to B at 70 mph.
Thus, he will travel from B to A at 90 mph for t-3 hours.
From the given information, we can create the following equation:
70t + 90(t-3) = d
Simplifying the equation gives:
160t - 270 = d

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Let's assume that each nephew receives x amount. Then each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x. Therefore, the total number of parts = 5 (for sons) + 4 (for daughters) + 2 (for nephews) = 11. 

Now, the total amount is Rs 8600. Therefore, x+4x+5x = 10x = 8600. 

Hence, each nephew gets x = 860. 

Each daughter gets 4x = 4*860 = 3440. 

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("C").
Response 1:
Let's start by finding how much each nephew receives. Let the amount each nephew get be "x". 

Then, each daughter will get 4x, and each son will get 5x. 

The total number of people receiving the money is 5+4+2=11.

So, the sum of money given will be 5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 27x.

We know that this sum is equal to Rs 8600. Therefore, 

27x = 8600 

x = 320 

So, each daughter will get 4x = 4(320) = Rs 1280. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, share of each daughter = 4x, and share of each son = 5x.
Total number of shares = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
Therefore, 11x = 8600
=> x = 800

Therefore, each daughter received 4x which is 4*800 = Rs. 3200.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the amount received by each nephew. Let's assume that each nephew receives x amount of money.

Total number of children and nephews = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11

Therefore, we can set up an equation based on the given information:

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2x = 8600

Simplifying the equation, we get:

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200

Therefore, each nephew receives Rs. 200.

Now, we can find how much each daughter receives:

Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, which means each daughter will receive 4x = 4*200 = Rs. 800

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let each nephew receive Rs x. Then, each daughter will receive Rs 4x and each son will receive Rs 5x.
Total number of children = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11
Total amount = Rs 8600
So, we have: 

5x + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
17x = 8600
x = 500

Hence, each daughter will receive Rs 4x = Rs 2000.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Let the share of each nephew be x. Then, each daughter will get 4x and each son will get 5x.
Total number of children = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11
Now, 5x + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
Simplifying, we get x = 400
Therefore, each daughter will get 4x = 4*400 = Rs 1600.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let the amount received by each nephew be x

Amount received by each son = 5*x
Amount received by 5 sons = 5*5*x = 25x

Amount received by each daughter = 4*x
Amount received by 4 daughters = 4*4*x = 16x

Amount received by 2 nephews = 2*x = 2x

Total amount received by all = 25x + 16x + 2x = 43x

So, 43x = 8600
x = 200

Amount received by each daughter = 4*x = 4*200 = 800

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
First, we need to calculate the share of one nephew. 

Let the share of each nephew be x. 

Then, the share of each daughter is 4x and the share of each son is 5x. 

The total number of people who are sharing the money is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. 

So, we have:

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600

43x = 8600

x = 200

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = Rs 800. 

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let the share of each nephew be x. 
Share of each son = 5x
Share of each daughter = 4(share of each nephew) = 4x

Total number of individuals = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11
Total amount = Rs 8600

Sum of shares of 5 sons = 5 * 5x = 25x
Sum of shares of 4 daughters = 4 * 4x = 16x
Sum of shares of 2 nephews = 2 * x = 2x

25x + 16x + 2x = 43x  (This is equal to total amount = Rs 8600)
43x = 8600
x = 200

Therefore, share of each daughter = 4x = 4 * 200 = 800

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Let's assume each nephew gets Rs. x.
So, each daughter gets Rs. 4x (as each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew)
And, each son gets Rs. 5x (as each son receives five as much as each nephew)

The total number of recipients is 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11.
Total amount = Rs. 8600

Now, we can create an equation:

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
Simplifying the equation, we get:
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs. 4x = 4(200) = Rs. 800

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 2520
  C: 1728
  D: 1656
  E: None
Response 0:
Let's denote the number as x.
The student found 7/18 of x instead of 7/8 of x. 
We can create an equation to solve for x: 

(7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770 

Simplifying: 

(35/72)x = 770 

Multiplying both sides by 72/35: 

x = 1540*72/35 = 31744

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
We can use the following formula to solve the problem:

Actual value = Incorrect value + Difference

Let the number be x. The student found the value of 7/18 of the number, instead of 7/8 of the number. So:

Incorrect value = (7/18)x

The difference between the incorrect value and the actual value is 770. So:

Difference = Actual value - Incorrect value
770 = (7/8)x - (7/18)x

Solving for x, we get:

770 = (77/72)x
x = 770 * 72 / 77
x = 720

Therefore, the number is 720.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
We can solve this problem through the following steps:
Let the actual number be x. Then we know that the student calculated (7/18)x instead of (7/8)x. So the difference between the two should be 770. 
Therefore, (7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770. 
Solving for x, we get x = 2520.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
We can begin by recognizing that the student found 7/18 of the number. So let's assume that the actual number is "x".
Then, we know that 7/18 of the number is (7/18)x.
However, the student wanted to find 7/8 of the number, which is (7/8)x.
We are told that the student's answer differed from the actual answer by 770. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

(21/72)x = 770

Multiplying both sides by 72/21, we find:

x = 2520

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")  

Explanation: 
The amount charged for each additional quarter-mile is $0.10. Therefore, the total distance can be calculated as:
$8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 (this is the amount available for the additional quarter-miles).
$5.00 / $0.10 per quarter-mile = 50 additional quarter-miles.
Total distance = 0.25 (first quarter-mile) + 0.25 x 50 (additional quarter-miles) = 0.25 + 12.50 = 12.75 miles
However, we must subtract the initial quarter-mile from the total distance since we only paid for the additional quarter-miles.
Therefore, the maximum distance that can be traveled is 12.75 - 0.25 = 11.75 miles.

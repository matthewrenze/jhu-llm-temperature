Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Let W, S and E represent the set of employees who take winter vacation, summer vacation, and either a winter, summer, or both vacations respectively. Then,
|W| = 0.75 E

|W ∩ S|= 0.40 E
|W ∪ S|= E - 0.20 E = 0.80 E
|E| = |W ∪ S| + |(W ∪ S)’| = |W ∪ S| + |E \ (W ∪ S)|

Then,
|E \ (W ∪ S)| = |E| - |W ∪ S| = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20
|W ∪ S|= |W| + |S| - |W ∩ S|

Then,

0.80 E = 0.75 E + |S| - 0.40 E

Then,
|S| = 0.45 E

Therefore, Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is:
|S but not W| = |S| - |W ∩ S|= 0.45 E - 0.40 E = 0.05 E = (5/100) E.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let the total number of employees in the company be 100.
If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 25 people take a summer and not this winter vacation. (75 - 40 - 20 = 15% take only winter vacation)
If 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, 40 people take both types of vacation.
If 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, 20 people take neither type of vacation.
So there are 100 - 25 - 40 - 20 = 15 people left who take only summer vacation.
Therefore, the percentage who take summer vacation but not winter vacation Q is (15/100) * 100 = 15%.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let's use a Venn diagram to solve the problem. 
Let the percentage of employees taking only a winter vacation be A, the percentage of employees taking only a summer vacation be B, and the percentage of employees taking both vacations be C.
Then we have, 
A + B + C = 75%        ...(1),
C = 40%                        ...(2),
100% - (A + B + C) = 20%  ...(3).
Solving the equations (1), (2), and (3), we get
A = 15%, B = 20%, and C = 40%.
Thus, the percentage of employees taking a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is B - C = 20% - 40% = -20%, which is not possible.
Therefore, the answer is None of the Above, as it is not possible for more employees to take only a summer vacation than are taking any kind of vacation.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
First of all, we know that P(Winter vacation) = 75% since 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, and we know P(Neither vacation) = 20%. 
Using these, we can find that P(At least one vacation) = 100% - P(Neither vacation) = 80%.

Let X be the number of people who take a winter vacation. Then X/4 people take only a winter vacation. 
And let Y be the number of people who take a summer vacation, then 2Y/5 people take both vacations and Y - 2Y/5 or 3Y/5 people take only a summer vacation.
Thus, 80% = X/4 + 2Y/5 + 20% implies 5X+8Y=400.

We want to find the percentage of people who took a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, which is 3Y/5. 
So we put Y in terms of X using 5X+8Y=400, which means Y=(400-5X)/8. Substituting this in 3Y/5, we get 3Y/5 = (3/5)*(400-5X)/8.
Now we just need to minimize X subject to the equation 5X+8Y=400. The minimum occurs when X=16 and Y=35.

Therefore, the percent of the employees that takes a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is (3(35)/5) = 21%.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. According to the information given:

- 75 of them take a winter vacation, which means that 100-75=25 do not take a winter vacation.
- 40 employees take both winter and summer vacation. This means that 35 employees(=75-40) take only winter vacation (not summer).
- 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacation. This means that there are 100-20=80 employees who take at least one of the two types of vacations.
- Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. Let's call this X.

To find X, we need to first find out how many employees take a summer vacation. We can do this by subtracting the number of employees who take no vacation from the total number of employees:
- Total number of employees = 100
- Employees who take no vacation = 20
- Employees who take at least one vacation = 80
- Employees who take a summer vacation = (80 - number of employees who take both vacations) = (80-40) = 40

Now we need to find out how many employees take both winter and summer vacations and subtract that from the number of employees who take a summer vacation only:
- Summer vacation only = X
- Both vacations (which we know is 40) = winter vacation + summer vacation - neither vacation = 35 + 40 - 20 = 55
- Therefore, X = 40 - 55 = -15

Since X cannot be negative, this means that there must have been a mistake in our assumptions or calculations. Let's review our calculations to find the mistake: 

- We correctly found that 40 people take summer vacations
- We also see that 35 people take only winter vacations
- We know that there are 20 people that don't take any vacations
- So, that leaves $100-(40+35+20)=5$ people who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation

Therefore, $Q=5$, which corresponds to choice A. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let N be the total number of employees at the company. Then, we have:

- 75% of employees take a winter vacation, which means 25% of employees do not take a winter vacation.
- Of the 75% that take a winter vacation, 40% also take a summer vacation. This means that 0.75*0.40 = 0.30 (or 30%) of employees take both a winter and summer vacation.
- 20% of employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. Therefore, 80% of employees take at least one vacation (winter or summer).
- Let Q% be the percentage of employees that take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. This means that Q% of employees take a summer vacation, but only 60% (75% - 30%) of these employees also take a winter vacation.

Putting all this together, we can write an equation to solve for Q:

80% = 0.25 + 0.30 + 0.60Q

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Q = 0.10 = 10%

Therefore, the answer is (A) 5%.

Topic: Math
Question: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 10
  C: 12
  D: 15
  E: 19
Response 0:
Let's say there are 'L' helpers required who can make a large cake, and 'S' helpers required who can make a small cake.
Now, from the given data,
1 helper can make 2 large cakes in an hour
Therefore, L helpers can make 2L large cakes in an hour
Similarly, 1 helper can make 35 small cakes in an hour
Therefore S helpers can make 35S small cakes in an hour

The kitchen is available for 3 hours, therefore total number of large cakes made by the helpers = (2L) * 3
total number of small cakes made by the helpers = (35S) * 3

From the question,
2L = 20 (since 20 large cakes are needed)
35S = 700 (since 700 small cakes are needed)

Solving these equations, we get:
L = 10 and S = 20

So, the total number of helpers required = L + S = 10 + 20 = 30

Therefore, Answer("None of the Above") since none of the answer choices match the correct answer of 30.
Response 1:
Let `x` be the required number of helpers.
Each helper can produce 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes in an hour.
Hence, x helpers can make 2x large cakes or 35x small cakes in an hour.
We need 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes.
Number of hours that can be utilized = 3 hours = 3 x 60 = 180 min
Overall time available = 3 + 20/60 = 3.33 hours or 200 min (approx.)

To get the number of helpers needed to accomplish both tasks, we can first find how many large cakes are produced per minute by one helper, then how many small cakes per minute, and add these rates together to get the combined rate for one helper. We can then multiply this rate by the number of helpers working together and set it equal to the required number of cakes. Finally, we can solve for the number of helpers.

The combined rate for one helper is:

2 large cakes/hour x 1 hour / 60 minutes = 1/30 large cake/minute
35 small cakes/hour x 1 hour / 60 minutes = 7/60 small cake/minute
Total rate = 1/30 large cake/minute + 7/60 small cake/minute
Total rate = 1/30 + 7/60 = 3/20 cake/minute

We require 20 large cakes. So, the large cake requirement in terms of minutes is 20 x 60 = 1200 minutes.
Also, we require 700 small cakes. So, the small cake requirement in terms of minutes is 700 x 1 = 700 minutes.

Thus, the total time in minutes required for both is 1900 min.

Number of helpers required = Total minutes requirement/[(rate of making large cakes per minute x n) + (rate of making small cakes per minute x n)]
Where, n is the number of helpers.

x = 1900 / [(1/30 + 7/60)x]
x = 1900 / (11/120)x
x = 20

Hence, we need 20 helpers to complete the task.

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let's assume the number of helpers required to make only large cakes is `L` and the number of helpers required to make small cakes is `S`. Then we can form the following equations based on the information given in the problem:

Equation 1: 2 * L + 35 * S <= 3 * 60  (since there are 3 hours available and given in minutes(180+60)=240)
Equation 2: 20 <= L * 2  (since 1 helper can make 2 large cakes per hour)
Equation 3: 700 <= 35 * S  (since 1 helper can make 35 small cakes per hour)

Let's solve the second equation for L: 

L * 2 >= 20  --> L >= 10

Now, let's substitute the value of L in Equation 1:

2*10 + 35*S <= 240  -->  35S <= 220 --> S <= 6.28

Thus, we need at least 7 helpers to make 6 small cakes in 3 hours. But the problem states that we need 700 small cakes, which means we need more helpers. Let's try with 8 helpers:

2*10 + 8 * 35 <= 240  -->  290 <= 240 [False]

Thus, we need at least 9 helpers: 

2*10 + 9 * 35 <= 240  -->  305 <= 240 [False]

Thus, we need at least 10 helpers:

2*10 + 10*35 <=240 -->  340<=240 [False]

Thus, we need at least 11 helpers:

2*10 + 11*35 <= 240   -->  375 <= 240 [False]

Thus, we need at least 12 helpers:

2*10 + 12*35 <= 240   -->  410 <= 240 [False]

Thus, we need at least 13 helpers:

2*10 + 13*35 <= 240   -->  425 <= 240 [False]

Thus, we need at least 14 helpers:

2*10 + 14*35 <= 240   -->  460 <= 240 [False]

Thus, we need at least 15 helpers:

2*10 + 15*35 <= 240   -->  495 <= 240 [False]

Thus, we need at least 16 helpers:

2*10 + 16*35 <= 240   -->  530 <= 240 [False]

Thus, we need at least 17 helpers:

2*10 + 17*35 <= 240  --> 565 <= 240 [False]

Thus, we need at least 18 helpers:

2*10 + 18*35 <= 240  --> 600 <= 240 [False]

Thus, we need at least 19 helpers:

2*10 + 19*35 <= 240  --> 635 <= 240 [False]

Since 18 helpers are not enough, we need 19 helpers to prepare the 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours. Therefore, the answer is E: 19.
Response 3:
First, let's convert the required quantity of small cakes into large cakes for convenience. 

700 small cakes = 700/35 = 20 large cakes

Now, we need to determine the amount of time required to make 20 large cakes and the number of helpers needed to do the job within that time limit. 

1 helper makes 2 large cakes in 1 hour, so 1 helper makes 20 large cakes in (20/2) x 1 = 10 hours

Alternatively, 1 helper makes 35 small cakes in 1 hour, so 1 helper makes 20 large cakes in (20 x 35)/2 = 350 minutes = 5 hours 50 minutes.

To make 20 large cakes in 3 hours, we need 3 x the amount of helpers that would be needed to make them in 10 hours, which is 3 x 1 = 3. 

To make 20 large cakes in 20/2 = 10 hours, we need 10/3 = 3.33 helpers. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we have to round up to get 4 helpers.

Therefore, we need 4 helpers to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
First, we can find how many cakes can be produced using all helpers during the 3 hours available. 

2 large cakes/hr * x helpers = 2x large cakes/hr 
35 small cakes/hr * x helpers = 35x small cakes/hr 

Therefore, total number of large cakes produced in 3 hours = 2x * 3 = 6x
Total number of small cakes produced in 3 hours = 35x * 3 = 105x 

We need 20 large cakes, which leaves 700 - 20*35 = 350 small cakes still needed.
Total cakes needed in 3 hours = 20 + 350 = 370 small cakes. 

Now we can find the number of helpers required to produce 370 small cakes in 3 hours:
35x * 3 = 370 
x = 3.34 

Since we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we would round up to the nearest whole number of helpers that would be able to produce the necessary 370 small cakes in 3 hours.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
First, we need to determine how many cakes each helper can make in one hour. 
Two large cakes and 35 small cakes are equivalent to 4/70 large cakes and 35/70 small cakes respectively. Thus, in one hour, each assistant can make:
2(4/70) + 35(35/70) = 4/35 + 35/2 = (8 + 1225)/70 = 233/35 small cakes or
2(1) + 35(0) = 2 large cakes.

Let H be the number of helpers that are needed.
We know that:
3H <= 3 hours
And that:
2(20H) + 35(700) <= 233H

We can simplify the second inequality to:

40H + 24,500 <= 233H
Subtracting 40H from both sides, we get:
24,500 <= 193H
Dividing both sides by 193, we get:
H <= 24,500/193
H <= 127.21

Since the number of helpers must be a positive integer, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Thus, we need H = 128 helpers.

Answer: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
To calculate the number of helpers required, we need to find how many hours of work are required to make the desired number of cakes.
Let the number of helpers required to make 2 large cakes in an hour be x.
Similarly, let the number of helpers required to make 35 small cakes in an hour be y.

So, x helpers can make 2 large cakes in an hour. Therefore, it would take 20/x hours for x helpers to make 20 large cakes.
Also, y helpers can make 35 small cakes in an hour. Therefore, it would take 700/y hours for y helpers to make 700 small cakes.

We know that the kitchen is available for 3 hours, so the total number of large cakes and small cakes that can be made in this time is given by
2xl + 35xy = cakes made by x helpers in 3 hours
35yl + 2xy = cakes made by y helpers in 3 hours

We need to solve these two equations to find the values of x and y.
Multiplying the first equation by 17.5 and the second by 40/7 and then adding these two equations, we get:

1050/x + 1000/y = 1700

Multiplying this equation by xy, we get:

1050y + 1000x = 1700xy

We need to find a pair of integers (x,y) that satisfies this equation and also satisfies the conditions that 20/x + 700/y <= 3.

Trying different values of x, we find that x=5 and y=14 are the only integers that satisfy this equation and the given conditions. Therefore, 5 helpers are required to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let's assume that 'L' represents the preparation of one large cake and 'S' represents the preparation of one small cake. 
The kitchen is available for 3 hours, so the maximum number of each type of cake that can be prepared is:
- Large cakes: 2 large cakes/hour * 3 hours = 6 large cakes
- Small cakes: 35 small cakes/hour * 3 hours = 105 small cakes

We need to prepare 20 large cakes, which requires 20L cakes, and 700 small cakes, which requires 700S cakes. 
Let's find the number of helpers we need by setting up a system of equations:
2L cakes/hour * h helpers = 20L cakes
35S cakes/hour * h helpers = 700S cakes

Simplifying each equation, we get:
h = 10L            ...(1)
h = 20S/7         ...(2)

Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
10L = 20S/7
S = 3.5L

Substituting S = 3.5L into either equation, we get the value of h (the number of helpers):
h = 20S/7 * (1/35)   [using equation (2) and converting S to large cakes]
h = 4

So we need 4 helpers. 

Answer: Answer("None of the above") [The answer is not listed among the options provided. The correct answer is 4 helpers.]
Response 8:
To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's assign "x" as the number of helpers required. 

Total number of hours available = 3

Total number of large cakes needed = 20 

Total number of small cakes needed = 700

The number of large cakes each helper can make per hour = 2

The number of small cakes each helper can make per hour = 35

Using this information, we can create two equations:

2x(hours)*number of helpers + 35x(hours)*number of helpers = 20 large cakes + 700 small cakes

Simplifying this equation, we get:

74x = 20 + 700 

74x = 720 

x = 9.73

Since we can't have a decimal value for the number of helpers, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need 10 helpers. 

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 9:
First, let's find out how many cakes can be made in 3 hours:
- One helper can make 2 large cakes/hr or 35 small cakes/hr.
- So, in 3 hours:
  - One helper can make 2 large cakes/hr x 3 hrs = 6 large cakes
  - One helper can make 35 small cakes/hr x 3 hrs = 105 small cakes
- Total cakes by one helper in 3 hours = 6 + 105 = 111 cakes

Next, let's find out how many cakes are still needed:
- 20 large cakes + 700 small cakes = 720 cakes needed

Now, let's find out how many helpers are required:
- If one helper makes 111 cakes in 3 hours, then number of helpers required for 720 cakes:
  - Number of helpers required = 720 cakes / (111 cakes/3 hrs) = 20/37 helpers
  - Rounding up to the nearest integer, we get 12 helpers.

Response 4:
First, we need to convert the speed of the train from miles per hour to miles per second:

Then, we need to add the length of the tunnel (1 mile) to the length of the train, which we do not know. Let's call the length of the train "x". 

The total distance the train needs to travel to pass completely through the tunnel is 1 + x miles. 

We know that the train enters the tunnel at time t=0 and exits the tunnel at time t=3 seconds. 

So, we can set up the following equation to solve for x: 

1 + x = (1/30) * 3 

1 + x = 1/10 

x = -9/10 

This answer does not make sense, since the length of the train cannot be negative. Therefore, the answer is "none of the above".

Action: Answer("B") 
Response 6:
Step 1: We know that there are 45 books in total.
Step 2: We also know that there are 30 hardcover books.
Step 3: We know that there are 20 fiction books.
Step 4: To find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we can start by assuming that all 20 fiction books are hardcover.
Step 5: However, we know that there are only 30 hardcover books in total, so we need to adjust our assumption.
Step 6: If we assume that 20 fiction books are hardcover, then we can only have a maximum of 20 - (30-20) = 10 hardcover non-fiction books.
Step 7: Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 10.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
There cannot be more books that are hardcover and fiction than the total number of books on the shelf, which is 45. Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is the minimum of the number of hardcover and fiction books, which is 20.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let H be the set of hardcover books and F be the set of fiction books. We want to find the maximum value of |H ∩ F|. 

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we have: 
|H ∩ F| = |H| + |F| - |H U F| 

We know that |H| = 30 and |F| = 20. To find |H U F|, we add the number of hardcover books and the number of fiction books and subtract the total number of books to avoid double counting: 

|H U F| = |H| + |F| - |H ∩ F| = 30 + 20 - 45 = 5. 

Substituting into our original formula, we have: 

|H ∩ F| = 30 + 20 - 5 = 45. 

However, this answer is impossible since it is larger than both |H| and |F|. So the correct answer is the maximum value that is feasible, which is:

Question: An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.
Choices:
  A: 21
  B: 22
  C: 20
  D: 23
  E: 24
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
We can set up a proportion to solve for the height of the tree:

height of pole / length of pole's shadow = height of tree / length of tree's shadow

Substituting the given values, we get:

14 / 10 = height of tree / 15

Simplifying and solving for the height of the tree, we get:

height of tree = 14/10 * 15 = 21

Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Here's how you can solve the problem:
Let the height of the tree be 'h' meters.
So, we can make a ratio of the height to the shadow of the electric pole and the tree as follows:
14 metres / 10 metres = h metres / 15 metres
This can be simplified as:
h = (14 x 15) / 10
h = 21

Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
To solve the problem, we can set up a proportion. The height of the electric pole is to its shadow as the height of the tree is to its shadow. That is:

    14 / 10 = x / 15

where x is the height of the tree.

Solving for x:

    x = 14 * 15 / 10
    x = 21

Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the ratios of corresponding sides of similar triangles are equal.  

Let x be the height of the tree. Then we can set up the following proportion: 

(hieght of pole) / (length of pole's shadow) = (height of tree) / (length of tree's shadow)

Substituting the given values:

14 / 10 = x / 15

Cross-multiplying, we get:

10x = 14 * 15

Simplifying, we get:

x = 21.

Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let x be the height of the tree in meters. We can set up the following proportion:
    
    (14 meters)/(10 meters) = x/(15 meters)

Simplifying this, we get:

    14/10 = x/15

Cross-multiplying, we get:

    10x = 14 * 15

Solving for x, we get:

    x = 21
    
Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

Question: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
Choices:
  A: 1,879
  B: 1,875
  C: 1,876
  D: 1,872
  E: 1,800
Response 0:
Solution:
Let's suppose Marked Price (MP) = x
So, Discount = 20%,  Selling price (SP) = 0.8x (Since after giving 20% discount, Karan will sell machine for 0.8x Rs)
We also know that Karan wants to make a 20% profit.
So, x - 1200 = 1.2 * 1200
Solving the above equation, we get x = Rs 2,040/-
So, Marked Price (MP) of the Sewing Machine should be 2040
But he wants to sell the machine at a discounted price, we need to subtract the discount
So, Selling Price (SP) = 0.8 * 2040 = Rs 1632/-
Hence, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs 2040/- in order to give a 20% discount and still make a 20% profit.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
Choices:
  A: 4,000
  B: 4,200
  C: 4,500
  D: 4,800
  E: 5,000
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let's start by finding the total percentage of staplers rejected. We know that 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, therefore 90 percent of the staplers were non-defective. From this non-defective group, we know that 2 percent were falsely rejected. So, the total percentage of rejected staplers is:

(2/100) x (90/100) = (2/100) x (9/10) = 0.018 or 1.8%

We also know that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected:

0.018x = 72

x = 72/0.018 = 4000

Therefore, the total number of staplers produced on Monday was:

0.1(4000) + 0.9(4000) = 400 + 3600 = 4000

So, the answer is Action: Answer("A").
Response 2:
Let's say the number of staplers produced on Monday is "x".
The number of defective staplers = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of non-defective staplers = 90% of x = 0.9x
Out of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake.
This means 0.02 * 0.9x = 72
Solving for "x",
x = 4000

Therefore, Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let the total number of staplers produced be "x". 
The number of defective staplers produced = 0.1x. 
Therefore, the number of non-defective staplers produced = x - 0.1x = 0.9x. 

Now, of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. This translates to 0.02 * 0.9x = 0.018x staplers being rejected. 

We know that the number of rejected staplers is 72. So we can set up an equation: 

0.018x = 72 

Solving for x: 

x = 4000 

Therefore, the total number of staplers produced that day was 4000. 

Answer: Answer("A") 4000
Response 5:
First, we need to find how many staplers were rejected in total. We know that 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up an equation: 0.02(non-defective staplers) = 72. Solving for non-defective staplers, we get: non-defective staplers = 3,600. 

Now we can find the total number of staplers produced. We know that 10 percent of Monday’s staplers were defective, so 90 percent were non-defective. That means that the total number of staplers produced is: total staplers = (non-defective staplers) / 0.9 = 4,000.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the factory produced x staplers. 
10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. Therefore the number of non-defective staplers produced = 0.9x.
Also, 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Therefore the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 0.02*0.9x = 0.018x
Given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, we can set up the following equation:
0.018x = 72
Solving for x, we get x = 4000
Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day is 4000.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let's first calculate how many non-defective staplers the factory produced on Monday:

* Let's say the factory produced x staplers on Monday.
* 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, which means that 90 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were non-defective. Therefore, the number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday is 0.9x.
* 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If we let y be the number of non-defective staplers that were not rejected, then we can set up the following equation: 0.98y = y - 72. Solving for y, we get y = 3750.
* Therefore, the total number of staplers produced on Monday is x = (3750 / 0.9) ≈ 4166.67.

Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
Since A and B are independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
Substituting the given values:
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.4P(B) = 0.36
P(B) = 0.9

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let P(B) = x
Since events A and B are independent, P(A intersection B) = P(A)P(B) = 0.6x
Using the formula for the union of two events: P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A intersection B)
We can plug in the given probabilities to obtain: 0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x
Solving for x, we have: 
0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x
0.36 = 0.4x
x = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let P(B) = probability that event B occurs.

P(at least one of A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
Given that the events are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)
Thus, 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 x P(B)
Solving the above equation gives P(B) = 0.8

Therefore, Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
We know that the probability of A occurring is 0.6, therefore, the probability of A not occurring is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. We also know that the probability of at least one of the events A or B occurring is 0.96. The probability that none of the events A or B occur is 1 - 0.96 = 0.04. Since A and B are independent, the probability of both events A and B not occurring is (0.4)(1 - P(B)) = 0.4 - 0.4P(B). We can now use this information to set up an equation:
  
  	P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
	0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
	0.36 = 0.4P(B)
	P(B) = 0.36/0.4
	P(B)  = 0.9

Action: Answer("E") 
Response 4:
Let's start by using the formula P(A or B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A and B), where P(A and B) is the probability that both A and B occur. Since A and B are independent, we know that P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B).

We are given that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96, so we can plug those values into the formula to get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6(1 + 0.4P(B))
1.6P(B) = 0.36
P(B) = 0.36/1.6
P(B) = 0.225

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.225, which is closest to choice A: 0.5. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B.   
Using the complement rule, P(at least one of A or B occurs) = 1 - P(neither A nor B occurs) = 1 - P(Ac∩Bc)=0.96.  
Since A and B are independent, we have P(Ac∩Bc) = P(Ac)P(Bc) = 0.4P(Bc).  
Therefore, 0.4P(Bc) = 0.04, P(Bc) = 0.1, and P(B) = 1 - P(Bc) = 0.9.  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let p = probability of event B. 

From the problem statement, 
P(A) = 0.6
P(A union B) = 0.96

Since A and B are independent, 

P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A intersection B)
0.96 = 0.6 + p - 0.6p
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4p
0.36 = 0.4p
p = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring. Since A and B are independent, the probability of both A and B occurring is P(A) * P(B).
The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is given by 1 - P(none of A or B) = 1 - P(A') * P(B') where A' and B' indicate the complements of A and B respectively (i.e., the events that A and B do not occur).
Since A and B are independent, P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.4 and P(B') = 1 - P(B). Therefore,
1 - P(A') * P(B') = 0.96
1 - 0.4 * (1 - P(B)) = 0.96
0.6 + 0.4 * P(B) = 0.96
0.4 * P(B) = 0.36
P(B) = 0.9
Thus, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let P(A) = 0.6, P(B) = p, then:

P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

Since A and B are independent:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)

Hence:

0.96 = P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) × P(B) = 0.6 + p - 0.6p

Solving for p:

0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4p

0.4p = 0.36

p = 0.9

Response 2:
Action: Answer("42.86%") 
Solution: 

Let's assume that the initial price of the product is 100. Then after the 30% reduction, the new price would be 70.

Now, let's assume that we want to increase the new price (70) to the initial price (100). By what percentage should we increase it?

To find the percentage increase, we can use the following formula:

Percentage increase = [(new value - old value) / old value] * 100%

Substituting the values, we get:

Percentage increase = [(100 - 70) / 70] * 100%
                   = 30 / 70 * 100%
                   = 42.86%

Let the highest score be H and the lowest score be L.
Given, (H+L)/2 = x  => H+L=2x  ---- (1)
Also, average score for the entire class is y => total score of all the student = y*z  ---- (2)

Let the sum of scores of highest and lowest scorers be s => s= H+L
Now, average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers
    => score of (z-2) students / (z-2)
    => (total score - s) / (z-2)
    => (yz - s) / (z-2)  [Using equation (2)]
    => (yz - H - L) / (z-2) [Substituting s=H+L]

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B") # The length of the space shuttle is 75 meters. 

Solution:
Let L be the length of the shuttle, and v be its maximum speed. We have the following equations: 

L = v × (40-5)  [since the shuttle travels at a constant speed after the 5-second mark until it reaches 700 m high]
700 = vt/2 [since the shuttle reaches a maximum height at half the time it took to travel that distance]

Solving for v in the second equation gives v = (2 × 700)/35 = 40 m/s
Substituting this into the first equation gives L = 40 × 35 = 1400 m. However, we need to subtract the distance the shuttle travels during the first 5 seconds, so L = 40 × 30 = 1200 m. Finally, we need to divide by the speed of the shuttle to get the length, so L = 1200/16 = 75 m.

Question: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
Choices:
  A: 58
  B: 62
  C: 66
  D: 70
  E: 74
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Solution:
Let the length of the rectangular yard be l and the width be w.
It is given that the area of the yard is 240 square meters. So, we have lw = 240.   ----(1)
We also know that three sides of the yard will be fenced and one side will be unfenced, which means that the total length of the three sides to be fenced is l + 2w - 10.  ----(2)
We need to find out the meters of fencing required i.e the value of (l + 2w - 10).
We can solve this problem by first expressing one variable in terms of the other in equation (1) and substituting that in equation (2) to get the final answer.

l = 240/w
Now, substituting this value of l in equation (2), we get - 

(l + 2w - 10) = (240/w) + 2w - 10

We take the derivative of this function and set it to zero to find its minimum value which is the answer to the problem.

d/dw [ (240/w) + 2w - 10 ] = (-240/w^2) + 2
Equating to zero, we get 

(-240/w^2) + 2 = 0
2 = 240/w^2
w^2 = 120
w = 2(sqrt(30))

Now, we can substitute this value of w back into the formula we derived above -

(l + 2w - 10) = (240/w) + 2w - 10
(l + 2(2(sqrt(30))) - 10) = (240/(2(sqrt(30)))) + 2(2(sqrt(30))) -10
(l + 4(sqrt(30)) -10) = 60 + 8(sqrt(30)) - 10
l + 4(sqrt(30)) - 10 = 50 + 8(sqrt(30)) 
l = 40
So, now we know l = 40 and w = 2(sqrt(30)), and we can finally compute the total meters of fencing required.

Total meters of fencing = l + 2w + l = 40 + 2(2(sqrt(30))) + 40 = 80 + 4(sqrt(30)) 

Therefore, the answer is  Action: Answer("D") i.e 70.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Solution: 
Let's consider the length of the unfenced side as x meters.
So, the area of the rectangular yard is length * width.
We know, area = 240 square meters
And the width covered by the fencing would be (length + width + length) or 2*length + width. Here we are not fencing one side of 10 meters, so we need to subtract 10 from the total fencing length.  

We now have two equations:
  - length * width = 240 (eq 1)
  - 2*length + width - 10 = Fencing Length (eq 2)

By cross multiplication from eq 1, we get width in terms of length as width = 240/length
We can substitute this width in eq 2 and simplify that to obtain length in terms of fencing length:
(2*length) + 240/length - 10 = Fencing Length
2*length^2 + 240 - 10*length = Fencing Length*length
2*length^2 - 10*length - Fencing Length*length + 240 = 0
2*length^2 - (10+Fencing Length)*length + 240 = 0
 
We can now solve this quadratic equation to find the value of length and then use that to find the fencing Length required.
  The factors of 2*240 (i.e 480) which add up to -(10+Fencing Length) are -30 and -16.
  So, (length-16)(2*length+30) = 0
This gives us two solutions, out of which only length = 8 is a valid solution (length cannot be negative).
  Thus, width = 240 / 8 = 30 and length = 8 meters.
  Fencing length required = 2*8 + 30 - 10 = 36 meters.

Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
Choices:
  A: 80
  B: 120
  C: 240
  D: 320
  E: 360
Response 0:
Let's solve it by using algebra.
Let the number of yellow golf balls be x. 
The number of white golf balls must also be x because it was sold out.
The store had 600 golf balls in stock, so:
total inventory = x + x = 2x
80% of the inventory was sold, so 0.8(2x)=1.6x golf balls were sold
The remaining inventory after selling all the white golf balls was 0.2(2x) = 0.4x golf balls. 
We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, so 0.4x white golf balls were sold which means 0 white golf balls remained. 
So 0.4x = 0.  ⇒ x = 360
Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E") 360.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let's first find out how many golf balls were sold during the day. 
The store sold 80% of its inventory, which means it sold 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls. 

Since the store sold the same number of white and yellow golf balls, and sold all of its white golf balls, we know that the number of white golf balls sold was the same as the initial number of white golf balls in stock, which is equal to the number of yellow golf balls in stock. 

Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 

480 = 2x 

where x is the initial number of yellow golf balls in stock. 

Simplifying the equation: 

x = 240 

So the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C") 240
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let the number of yellow golf balls that the store had to begin with be y. 

Since the store sold all its white golf balls and sold an equal number of yellow golf balls, we know that the number of white golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day is equal to half of y (i.e. y/2).

We also know that the store sold 80% of its golf balls. This means that it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and all the white golf balls were sold, we can conclude that the store began the day with y + y/2 = 2.5y golf balls.

We can set up an equation to solve for y:

480 = 0.8 * 2.5y
480 = 2y
y = 240

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C") 240.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let the total inventory at the beginning of the day = X  
Let the number of white golf balls in inventory at the beginning of the day = W  
Thus, the number of yellow golf balls in inventory at the beginning of the day = X - W  

We know from the question:  
W = 0.5 * (0.8 * X) = 0.4X  

Additionally, we know:  
W = 600 - (X - W) = 600 - (X - 0.4X) = 0.6X - 600  

Equating the two expressions for W, we get:  
0.4X = 0.6X - 600  
0.2X = 600  
X = 3000  

Thus, the number of yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day = X - W = 3000 - 0.4X = 3000 - 0.4 * 3000 = 1800  

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E") 1800
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let y be the number of yellow golf balls and w be the number of white golf balls the store had before selling them.
We know that y+w = 600 (total number of golf balls).
Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, we have w = 0.
After selling 80% of its inventory, the store had 20% of its inventory remaining, which is 0.2*600 = 120 golf balls.
Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, we have y = 0.5*(600-120) = 240.
Thus, the answer is Action: Answer("C").
Response 9:
Let's assume that there were x yellow golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day, so there were 600 - x white golf balls.
Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, then the store sold (600 - x)/2 white golf balls and also (600 - x)/2 yellow golf balls. 
If the store sold 80% of its inventory, then it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls in total.
Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, then (600 - x)/2 = 0, which means x = 600/2 = 300 yellow golf balls were sold. 
So, the store had 600 - 300 = 300 yellow golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day.

Question: The bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh id four-thirds the train fare between the same places for one person. The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Find the train fare between the two places for one person?
Choices:
  A: 126
  B: 77
  C: 88
  D: 66
  E: 54
Response 0:
Let the train fare for one person be x. 

Then bus fare for two persons = (4/3) * x

Total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus = 3 * {(4/3) * x} = 4x

Total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train = 8x

Given, 4x + 8x = 1512

Simplifying, we get x (train fare for one person) = 84

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("None of the above") [Here, none of the given options (A, B, C, D, E) is the correct answer.]
Response 1:
Let x be the train fare between the two places for one person.

Given, the bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh is (4/3)x for one person.

So, bus fare for travelling to-and-fro between Agra and Aligarh for 6 persons = 6*(4/3)x = 8x

And, train fare for travelling to-and-fro between Agra and Aligarh for 8 persons = 8x

Total fare paid = bus fare + train fare = 8x + 8x = 16x

As it is given that the total fare paid by the 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512.

Therefore, 16x = 1512

Thus, the train fare between the two places for one person (x) = 1512/16 = 94.

Hence, the answer is A: 126.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 3:
Solution:
Let bus fare for 2 persons be x
Let train fare for 1 person be y
According to the problem,
2x/3 = y
Now, total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512.
So, 6x + 8y = 1512 -------(1)
Substitute value of y from (2) to (1), we get
6x + 8(2x/3) = 1512
6x + 16x/3 = 1512
6x + (16/3)x = 1512
(30/3)x = 1512
10x = 1512
x = 151.2
Now, y = 2x/3 = 2*151.2/3 = 100.8
Therefore, the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs.100.8.

Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Solution:
Let the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person = Rs.x
Therefore, the bus fare for two persons between the same places = (4/3)x
Total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between Agra and Aligarh = 6 * 2 * (4/3)x + 8 * x = Rs.1512
Simplifying the above equation, we get 16x = 1512 * 3 / 7
Therefore, x = 84 * 3 / 28 = Rs. 9.
Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person = Rs.9

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let x be the train fare between the two places for one person.
Then, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)x.
The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 3*(4/3)x = 4x.
The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8x.
We know that the sum of these two fares is Rs. 1512.
So, 4x + 8x = 1512
Simplifying the equation, we get 12x = 1512
Solving for x, we get x=126.
Therefore, the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs. 126.
 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's find the equations based on the given information:
Let the bus fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person be x.
Given that, the bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh is (4/3)*y, where y is the train fare between the same places for one person. Hence, y=(3/4)*x.

The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. So, we have the equation 6x+8(y)=1512.

We have y=(3/4)*x. Substituting this value in the above equation and simplifying, we get x=126.

Therefore the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs.126.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let's assume that the train fare between the two places for one person is 'x'.  
So, the bus fare for two persons is 4x/3.  
The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512.  
Therefore, (6*(4x/3)) + (8x) = 1512  
Simplifying the above equation, we get: 24x + 24x = 1512*3  
i.e. 48x = 4536  
i.e. x = 94.5  

Hence, the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs.94.5

Thus, the amount of food remaining is 16/81 of the original amount. We can find the percentage of the original amount remaining by dividing the remaining amount by the original amount and multiplying by 100%:

(16/81) * 100% ≈ 19.75%

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's say that the original amount of dog food was 9 units (this is just an arbitrary number for calculation purposes). 

At 9:00 am, 1 hour after Jim filled the bowl, the dog had eaten 1/3 of the original 9 units, leaving 6 units in the bowl. 

At 10:00 am, the dog ate 1/3 of the 6 units that were left at 9:00 am, leaving 4 units in the bowl. 

At 11:00 am, the dog ate 1/3 of the 4 units that were left at 10:00 am, leaving 8/3 units in the bowl. 

Finally, at 12:00 pm, the dog ate 1/3 of the 8/3 units that were left at 11:00 am, leaving 16/9 units in the bowl. 

So, right before the dog began to eat at noon, there were 16/9 units of dog food out of the original 9 units. 

We can convert this fraction to a percentage: 

16/9 * 100% / 9 = 177.8% / 9 = 19.76%

So approximately 19.76% of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon.

At 11am, there is (2/9)*(1/3) = 2/27 remaining.
At 12pm, there is (2/27)*(1/3) = 2/81 remaining.
Therefore, there is (2/81) / (X) = 2/81 percentage of original food in the bowl.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
Choices:
  A: $8
  B: $10
  C: $13.6
  D: $22.9
  E: $40
Response 0:
Let 'x' be the old price of each article.
Then, 0.85x is the new price of each article after 15% discount.
Also, Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300.
Hence, we can write the following equation: 5x = (5 / 0.85) * 300
Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 68
Therefore, the new price of each article is:
0.85x = 0.85 * 68 = $57.8
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Solution:
Let x be the original selling price of each article.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new selling price of each article is:
x - 0.15x = 0.85x
Let y be the new selling price of each article.
We can set up an equation based on the given information:
5y = $300 + 5x
5(0.85x) = $300 + 5x
4.25x = $300
x = $70
So the original selling price of each article was $70.
The new selling price of each article is:
y = 0.85x = 0.85($70) = $59.50
Therefore, the Answer is: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
We can use the following steps to solve the problem:
Let the original selling price of each article be "x"
Reducing the price by 15% means the new selling price is "0.85x"
If Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, it means each article costs $300/(5+1) = $50
We can set up the following equation based on the information given: 0.85x = $50
Solving for "x", we get x = $58.82
Therefore, the new selling price of each article (which decreased by 15%) is:
0.85($58.82) = $49.996 or approximately $50.
Rounding it off to the nearest whole number, we get $50.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula:
new price = old price x (100% - percent off)/100%
We know that Anna was able to buy 5 more items for the same amount of $300, so her budget for each item is now $300/(original number of items + 5). 
Let's assume the original price of each item is p. 
We know that the percent decrease is 15%, so the new price of each item can be calculated as: 
(100-15)% of p is the amount Anna pays now for each item which is 85% of p.
Then we can set up an equation:
$300/(p+5) = 5/(0.85p)
Solving the equation, we get p = $40.
So, the new price of each item is: 85% of $40 = $34
Therefore, the correct answer is 
Action: Answer("None of the above") (It should be $34).
Response 4:
We can begin by setting up a system of equations. Let x be the original price of each article in dollars. 

Then, after decreasing the price by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x. 

If Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, we know that she originally planned to spend $300 - 5x on these articles. However, with the reduced price, she now spends $300 on the same number of articles: 

5(0.85x) = $300 

Solving for x, we find: 

x = $70 

So the original price of each article was $70, and the new price is 15% less: 

0.85($70) = $59.50 

Answer: Answer("None of the Above") 
(None of the above is the most likely answer, as the correct answer is not listed among the choices.)
Response 5:
Solution: 

Let's start by assuming the original price of each article is x. 

At 15% discount, the new price of each article is 

x - 15% of x = x - 0.15x = 0.85x 

This means, Anna can now buy 5 articles for $300, so 

5 * 0.85x = $300 

Simplifying, we get: 

x = 70 

So, the original selling price of each article was $70. 

After the price decreased by 15%, the new selling price of each article is: 

0.85 * 70 = $59.5 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("None of the Above") -> $59.5 is not one of the available choices. 

The closest answer is choice C: $13.6, however, that is not the correct answer.
Response 6:
Solution:
If the price of each article decreased by 15%, then the new price of each article is equal to 85% of the old price. Let x be the original selling price of each article.
So, we can write: 

5x = $300 + (5*0.85)x   
5x = $300 + 4.25x      
5x - 4.25x = $300      
0.75x = $300  
x= $400/3

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:
0.85x = 0.85($400/3) = $68/5 = $13.6

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Solution: 

Let the original selling price of each article be x.

After decreasing the price by 15%, the new selling price of each article is:

x - 0.15x = 0.85x

Anna has $300 to spend on articles.

If she can buy 5 more articles than before at the new price, then:

5(0.85x) = 300

Multiplying both sides by (1/5) gives:

0.85x = 60

x = 60/0.85

x = 70.59 approximately.

Therefore, the new selling price of each article (after decreasing the price by 15%) is:

0.85x = 0.85(70.59) = $60.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Solution: 

Let the original price of each article be x.

After 15% decrease, the new price of each article becomes (x - 0.15x) = 0.85x

Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%.

Then, 5(0.85x) = $300

Solving for x, we get x = $70

Therefore, the new selling price of each article (after the price decrease) is 0.85x = 0.85($70) = $59.5

Answer: Answer("none of the above") 

It seems that none of the given choices is equal to $59.5. The closest option that we can select in this case is Option C: $13.6.
Response 9:
Solution:
Let the original selling price of each article be x.

After a discount of 15%, the new selling price of each article will be:
x - 0.15x = 0.85x

Let the new selling price of each article be y.

As Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, we can set up the following equation:

5y = 300 + 5x

Substituting y = 0.85x, we get:

5(0.85x) = 300 + 5x

Simplifying and solving for x, we get:

x = 40

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is:

y = 0.85x = 0.85(40) = $34

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope?
Choices:
  A: 7.5
  B: 8.9
  C: 9.9
  D: 11.5
  E: 11.7
Response 0:
Let's call the length of the longer piece of rope as "x". Then, the length of the other piece of rope can be written as "x-3". We know that the total length of the rope is 20 meters, so we can write an equation: 

x + (x-3) = 20 

Simplifying this equation: 

2x - 3 = 20 

Adding 3 to both sides: 

2x = 23 

Dividing both sides by 2: 

x = 11.5 

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's denote the length of the longer piece of road with x meters. Then, we know that the shorter piece of road will be $(x-3)$ meters. Furthermore, we know that the sum of the shorter piece and the longer piece will be 20 meters. Therefore we can set up the equation:

$$x + (x-3) = 20$$

Simplifying we get:

$$2x - 3 = 20$$

$$2x = 23$$

$$x = \frac{23}{2} = 11.5$$

So, the longer piece of rope will have a length of 11.5 meters. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let's call the length of the longer piece of rope "x". Then we know the length of the shorter piece of rope is "x - 3". Since the two pieces of rope together add up to 20 meters, we can write an equation: 

x + (x - 3) = 20

Combining like terms, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides, we get:

2x = 23

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. Then, the length of the shorter piece of rope would be x - 3. Since the total length of the rope is 20, we have:

x + x - 3 = 20

Simplifying the equation:

2x = 23

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let the length of one piece of rope be x. Therefore, the length of the other piece of rope is 20-x. Finally, we know that one rope length is 3 meters shorter than the other rope length. Therefore:

20 - x = x - 3

Solving for x, we get x = (20 + 3) / 2
                                 = 11.5

So the length of one rope is 11.5 and the other rope length is 20 - 11.5 = 8.5

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let the length of the longer piece be x meters. According to the problem, the shorter piece is 3 meters shorter, so it has a length of x - 3 meters. The sum of the two lengths is 20 meters. So, we can write an equation:
x + (x - 3) = 20
Simplifying:
2x - 3 = 20
2x = 23
x = 11.5

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let x be the length of the shorter piece of rope. We have two unknowns, the length of the longer piece of the rope and the length of the shorter piece. We can model the problem with the equation x + (x + 3) = 20, which represents the fact that the total length of the rope is equal to the length of the shorter piece plus 3 meters plus the length of the longer piece. Solving for x, we get x = 8.5. Therefore, the longer piece of the rope has a length of x + 3 = 11.5 meters. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let the length of the longer piece of rope be `x`. Then the length of the shorter piece of rope is `x - 3`.

The total length of the rope is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces: `x + x - 3 = 20`

Simplifying the equation we get `2x - 3 = 20`

Adding 3 to both sides, we get `2x = 23`

Dividing by 2, we get `x = 11.5`

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is  `x = 11.5`.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's call the length of the shorter piece of the rope "x". We know that the length of the longer piece is 3 meters longer than the shorter piece, so we can call it "x + 3".
We are also told that the two pieces add up to 20 meters:
x + (x + 3) = 20
2x + 3 = 20
2x = 17
x = 8.5
So the length of the longer piece is x + 3 = 8.5 + 3 = 11.5
Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("D") 11.5
Response 9:
Let's represent the length of the longer piece of rope with the variable x. According to the problem, the length of the shorter piece of rope is 3 meters less than x, so we can represent it as x - 3. We know that the two pieces of rope add up to the total length of 20 meters, so:
x + (x - 3) = 20
Simplifying the expression on the left side:
2x - 3 = 20
Adding 3 to both sides:
2x = 23
Dividing by 2:
x = 11.5

Question: In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?
Choices:
  A: 96
  B: 48
  C: 32
  D: 25
  E: 18
Response 0:
Let's start by figuring out how many times each song was selected. Since there are 10 songs and each song was selected twice by each student, then each song was selected a total of 5 x 2 = 10 times. 

Let N be the number of students surveyed. If each student selected 2 songs, then there were a total of 2N song selections. Since each song was selected 10 times, then the total number of song selections is also 10 x 10 = 100.

Therefore, we can set up an equation:
2N = 100

Solving for N, we get:
N = 50

So, 50 students were surveyed.

Response 4:
This is a bit of a tricky question, but we can use some reasoning to arrive at the correct answer. Since each student chooses 2 songs, we know that a total of 2 * x songs were chosen, where x is the number of students surveyed. We are also told that each song was chosen 5 times -- since there are 10 songs, this means that there were a total of 10 * 5 = 50 choices made. 
 
Since each choice corresponds to 1 student, we can set up the equation as follows:
 
2x = 50
 
Solving for x, we get:
 
x = 25
 
So the answer is:
 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
To solve this problem, we can use the following formula: 

number of students = (total number of song selections) / (number of songs each student selected)

Each student selected 2 songs from a list of 10, so there were a total of 2 x 5 = 10 song selections per student.

We also know that each song was selected 5 times, which means there were a total of 5 x 10 = 50 song selections.

Plugging these numbers into the formula above, we get:

number of students = 50 / 10 = 5

Therefore, Answer("B") 48 students were surveyed.
Response 6:
We can start by assuming that there were 'n' number of students surveyed. Each student selects 2 songs giving a total of 2n song selections. If each song was selected 5 times, then the total number of song selections = 5 x 10 = 50. Hence, 2n = 50, which gives n = 25. Therefore, the answer is:

Question: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 1120
  C: 792
  D: 1320
  E: 1200
Response 0:
First, we need to write equations using the perimeter of each fold.

Let l and b be the length and breadth of the sheet, respectively.

When we fold the sheet along the length, the perimeter is 48 cm; since the sheet is folded into two equal halves, each part's perimeter is 48/2 = 24cm.

Therefore,
2l + b = 24      -----(Equation 1)

When we fold the sheet along the breadth, the perimeter is 66cm; since the sheet is again folded into two equal halves, each part's perimeter is 66/2 = 33cm.

Therefore,
2b + l = 33      -----(Equation 2)

Solving Equation 1 and Equation 2 simultaneously, we get l = 15cm and b = 6cm.

Therefore, the area of the sheet is l × b = 15 × 6 = 90 cm².

Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Solution: 
Let's assume that the length of the sheet is 'l' and the breadth is 'b'. 
When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part will be equal to (48/2)=24 cm. So the dimensions of the two parts will be (l/2) and b, respectively. Hence, we can write:
2(l/2 + b) = 24
=> l + 2b = 24    .......(Equation 1)

Similarly, when folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part will be equal to (66/2)=33 cm. So the dimensions of the two parts will be (b/2) and l, respectively. Hence, we can write:
2(b/2 + l) = 33
=> b + 2l = 33    .......(Equation 2)

Solving Equations 1 and 2, we get:
l = 9 cm and b = 6 cm

Therefore, the area of the sheet will be:
Area = l x b
=> 9 x 6
=> 54 cm^2

Answer: Answer("None of the Above") (The answer is 54 which is not listed in any of the choices)
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Method: 
Let the length and breadth of the rectangle be L and B respectively. When folded along length, each of the two parts make up a rectangle of length L and breadth B/2. The equation can thus be formed as 2L + 2B/2 = 48 i.e., L + B/2 = 24 and 2L/2 + 2B = 66 i.e., L/2 + B = 33. Solving these two equations, we get L=12 and B=30.

Now the area of the rectangle is L*B = 12*30 = 360 sq. units.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
First, let's denote the length and width of the rectangular sheet as "l" and "w", respectively. 

Then, when folded along the length, each half will have a length of l/2 and a width of w, and the perimeter of each half will be: 

2(l/2 + w) = l + 2w 

We're told that this is equal to 48 cm, so: 

l + 2w = 48 

Similarly, when folded along the width, each half will have a length of l and a width of w/2, and the perimeter of each half will be: 

2(l + w/2) = 2l + w 

We're told that this is equal to 66 cm, so: 

2l + w = 66 

Now we have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve for l and w. 

Multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting the second equation, we get: 

2l + 4w - (2l + w) = 96 - 66 

3w = 30 

w = 10 

Substituting this value of w into either of the original equations, we can solve for l: 

l + 2w = 48 

l + 20 = 48 

l = 28 

Finally, we can calculate the area of the sheet as: 

Area = length x width = l x w = 28 x 10 = 280 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("E") 
Response 8:
Solution: 
Let the length of the rectangular sheet be 'l' and the breadth be 'b'. 
When the sheet is folded along the length, the perimeter of each part becomes 48/2 = 24.
So, 2 * l + b = 24. (eq.1)
When the sheet is folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part becomes 66/2 = 33.
So, l + 2 * b = 33. (eq.2)
Solving eq.1 and eq.2, we get: 
l=9 and b=12
The area of the rectangular sheet is l * b which is equal to 9 * 12 = 108. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Let x and y be the length and breadth of the rectangle respectively.
The perimeter of one part folded = 48cm. If folded along the length, x + y/2 = 24. If folded along the breadth, y + x/2 = 24
The perimeter of the other part folded = 66cm. If folded along the length, x + y/2 = 33. If folded along the breadth, y + x/2 = 33

We can solve the two equations and get x = 18 and y = 24.

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is xy = 18 * 24 = 432 square cm.

Question: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.
Choices:
  A: 2 miles
  B: 2.25 miles
  C: 3.25 miles
  D: 3.85 miles
  E: 2.85 miles
Response 0:
We can use the formula `distance = speed x time` to solve the problem.

If Bill's speed is 15 mph in no wind conditions and his speed is reduced by 4 mph, then his speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Converting 21 minutes to hours, we get: 21 minutes ÷ 60 minutes per hour = 0.35 hours.

So, using the formula: `distance = speed x time`, we get:

`distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles`

Therefore, the answer is Choice (D): 3.85 miles.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
First converting 21 minutes to its equivalent in hours: 
21 minutes x (1 hour / 60 minutes) = 0.35 hours.

On a normal day, Bill can travel 15 miles per hour (mph), but on a windy day his speed is reduced by 4 mph for a total speed of 15 - 4 = 11 mph. 

We can then calculate how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 0.35 hours by using the formula `distance = rate x time`:

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

Round to the nearest hundredth: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
First, we need to calculate Bill's speed on a windy day. His speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed on a windy day would be: 

15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph 

We can use the formula `distance = rate x time` to find how far Bill can travel in 21 minutes (which is 0.35 hours).

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

So the answer is:

Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
We can start by using the formula distance = rate x time. On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced to 15-4 = 11 mph. We need to convert 21 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 21/60 = 0.35 hours. Therefore, the distance Bill can travel is:

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

Round to the nearest hundredth, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
First, convert 21 minutes to hours: 21 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.35 hours.

On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph.

To find the distance he can travel, use the formula: distance = rate x time.

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
To solve the problem, first we convert 21 minutes to hours which is 21/60 = 0.35 hours. Then, we calculate Bill's speed on a windy day which is 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph. Finally, we use the formula distance = speed x time to calculate how far he can travel which is distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Since Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph, his speed on a windy day is 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph

21 minutes is 21/60 = 0.35 hours

Distance = Rate × Time

Distance = 11 mph × 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles (rounded to the nearest hundredth)

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
On a normal day Bill speed = 15 mph, and on a windy day his speed is reduced by 4 mph making his effective wind speed 15-4=<<15-4=11>>11 mph.  

To find how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes (0.35 hour), we can multiply his speed by time; distance = speed x time.  

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hour = <<11*0.35=3.85>>3.85 miles.  

Therefore, Bill can travel approximately 3.85 miles on a windy day in 21 min.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In a bag of red and green sweets, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, how many red sweets are there?
Choices:
  A: 90
  B: 80
  C: 95
  D: 100
  E: 85
Response 0:
Let R be the number of red sweets in the bag.
We know that the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, which means that the total number of parts is 3+4 = 7.
Since the ratio of green sweets to red sweets is 4:3, we can set up the following proportion:
4/3 = 120/R (green sweets : red sweets)
Cross-multiplying, we get:
4R = 360
R = 90
Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Solution: 

The ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. Therefore, for every 4 parts of green sweets, there are 3 parts of red sweets. 

If there are 120 green sweets in the bag, we can set up the following proportion: 

4/3 = 120/x 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = (3*120)/4 

x = 90 

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's solve the problem using ratios. 

We know that the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. This means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. 

We also know that there are 120 green sweets. We can use this information to find out how many "sets" of 3 red sweets and 4 green sweets there are: 

4 green sweets = 1 set 
120 green sweets = 120/4 = 30 sets 

So there are 30 sets of 3 red sweets. 
30 sets x 3 red sweets per set = 90 red sweets 

Therefore, the answer is A: 90. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
We can start the problem by using the ratio to find the number of red sweets. 

Let x be the number of red sweets in the bag. 

Then the ratio of red sweets to green sweets can be expressed as:

3/4 = x/120

To solve for x, cross-multiply:
4x = 3 * 120
x = 90

Therefore there are 90 red sweets in the bag.
 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's call the number of red sweets "x". We know that the ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4, which means there are 3 parts of red sweets to every 4 parts of green sweets. We can set up the following proportion: 

3/4 = x/120 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

4x = 3 * 120 

4x = 360 

x = 90 

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
First, find the ratio in terms of one of the numbers. Let's choose to represent the number of green sweets as 4x (since the ratio of red to green is 3:4):
- Green sweets = 4x = 120
- x = 30
Now we can find the number of red sweets (since the ratio of red to green is 3:4):
- Red sweets = 3x = 90
Therefore, the answer is **Answer("A") 90**.
Response 9:
Let's first find out the ratio of red sweets to the total number of sweets in the bag. We can write this as:

red sweets : green sweets = 3 : 4

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both sides by the greatest common factor (GCF) of 3 and 4, which is 1:

red sweets : green sweets = 3/1 : 4/1 = 3 : 4

This means that out of every 7 sweets in the bag, 3 are red and 4 are green.

We're given that there are 120 green sweets in the bag. Since we know that there are 4 green sweets for every 7 sweets in the bag, we can set up a proportion:

4/7 = 120/x

where x is the total number of sweets in the bag.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

4x = 7 * 120
4x = 840
x = 210

So there are a total of 210 sweets in the bag. To find out how many of those are red, we can use the ratio of red to total sweets:

red sweets : total sweets = 3 : 7

Setting up a proportion again, we get:

3/7 = red/x

where x is the total number of sweets in the bag (which we already found to be 210).

Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:

3x = 7 * 120
3x = 840
x = 280

So there are 280 total sweets in the bag, and out of those, 3/7 are red:

red : total = 3/7
red : 280 = 3/7

Cross-multiplying and simplifying:

red = 120

Therefore, there are 120 red sweets in the bag.

Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's assume that originally, "x" number of people were planning to attend the picnic. The total amount to be spent was Rs. 96. So, each person would have contributed Rs. (96/x).
But since 4 people did not turn up, the new number of people attending the picnic was (x-4). They now had to pay an extra Rs. 4 each, making their individual contribution (96/(x-4) + 4). We can now equate these two contributions to get the value of "x".
So, (96/x) = (96/(x-4) + 4)
Solving this equation, we get x = 12.
Therefore, the number of people attending the picnic was 12 before 4 of them did not turn up.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let the number of friends who would have attended if all four showed up be 'x'. Then the cost per friend originally would have been '96/x'. When only (x-4) friends showed up, they each had to contribute an extra Rs. 4, making the new cost per friend '96/(x-4) + 4'. Since the cost per friend increased, we can set up an equation like this:

96/x = 96/(x-4) + 4

We can solve for 'x' by simplifying and solving the resulting quadratic equation:

96/x = 96/(x-4) + 4
96(x-4) = 96x + 4x(x-4)   (multiplied both sides by x(x-4))
96x - 384 = 96x + 4x² - 16x   (expanded the right side)
4x² - 16x - 384 = 0   (subtracted 96x from both sides and simplified)
x² - 4x - 96 = 0   (divided both sides by 4)

We can now use the quadratic formula to solve for 'x':

x = (-(-4) ± sqrt((-4)² - 4(1)(-96))) / (2(1))
x = (4 ± sqrt(16 + 384)) / 2
x = (4 ± 20) / 2

We reject the negative root since the number of friends cannot be negative, so we conclude:

x = 12

Therefore, the number of those who attended the picnic was (x-4) = 8.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
Response 0:
Let x be the number of students in the school.
Then the least possible number of students in the school would be attained when the percentage of Math students is maximized and the percentage of Physics students is minimized.
Given that 28% of the students exactly took Math, we can say 0.28x students took Math.
Given that 20% of the students exactly took Physics, we can say 0.20x students took Physics.
Therefore, the minimum number of students in the school
= the sum of Math and Physics students
= 0.28x+0.20x = 0.48x
0.48x > 501 (given in the question)
Therefore, x = 1043.75, i.e. a minimum of about 1044 students are needed.
The closest option to this value is option D: 700. However, the correct answer is 
Action: Answer("E") i.e. none of these.
Response 1:
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we assume that all students who take math are taking physics as well. Therefore, the minimum number of students in the school can be calculated using the following equation:

number of students who took math = 28% x total number of students
number of students who took physics = 20% x total number of students
total number of students = number of students who took math / 0.28

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

total number of students = (0.28 / 0.20) x number of students who took math
total number of students = 1.4 x number of students who took math

Assuming that all students who take math are also taking physics, the minimum possible number of students who took math is 28% of the total number of students in the school (i.e., there are no students who took physics only). Therefore:

number of students who took math = 28% x total number of students
number of students who took math = 0.28 x total number of students

Now we can substitute this equation into the previous one to get:

total number of students = 1.4 x 0.28 x total number of students
total number of students = 0.392 x total number of students
total number of students = 2.551 x number of students who took math

Since the number of students must be an integer, the minimum possible number of students who took math is 1. To get the minimum number of students in the school, we plug in 1 for number of students who took math:

total number of students = 2.551 x 1
total number of students = 2.551

Therefore, the minimum possible number of students in the school is 3 (since we can't have a fraction of a student). 

So, the answer is E: none of these.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
To determine the minimum number of students we make use of the largest percentages which are 28%. That means there are 28% of students that took math, and the other 72% did not take it. However, we know that there are more than 501 students in the school. So, the minimum number of students would be the smallest integer value that corresponds to 72% of it, that is greater than 501.

We can set an equation as follows:
```
72/100 * n = no of students that did not take math >= 501
```

where `n` is the minimum number of students.

Then, we can simplify the equation and solve for `n`:
```
72/100 * n >= 501
n >= 501 * 100 / 72
n >= 695.8
```
Since `n` represents a whole number, we round up to 696.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
To get the minimum number of students, we need to consider a scenario where the percentage of students taking physics and math don't overlap.
Let's assume that 20% take only physics and 28% take only math.
Then, the minimum number of students can be found using the formula: `Total no of students = (No of students taking only physics / Percentage of students taking only physics) x 100`
Using the formula for both physics and math, we get:
`Total no of students = (20 / 20) x 100 = 100`
`Total no of students = (28 / 28) x 100 = 100`
Therefore, the minimum possible number of students in the school is 200.
Answer: Answer("E") none of these.
Response 5:
Let x be the number of students in the school.
The minimum number of students in the school can be calculated as follows:
- The number of students who took Physics is 20% of x
- The number of students who took Math is 28% of x
- The total number of students who took either Physics or Math is greater than 501.
So we can write: 0.2x + 0.28x > 501
Simplifying, we get: 0.48x > 501
Dividing both sides by 0.48, we get: x > 1043.75
Since x has to be an integer, the minimum possible value of x is 1044.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
To find the least possible number of students, we assume that 20% of the total students took physics and 28% of the total students took math. We can't assume any other percentage for a minimum value. 

We can write:
20% of x + 28% of x ≤ 100%
(20/100)x + (28/100)x ≤ 1
(48/100)x ≤ 1
x ≥ 100*(100/48)

x ≥ 208.33

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 209, which is not one of the given choices. Thus, Answer("E").

Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")  
Solution: Let the cost price of the watch be x, then the profit earned on selling it at marked price will be `5x/100`. The selling price of the watch after a 5% discount will be `.95x`. The profit earned on selling it at this price will be `0.95x - x/20 = 19x/20`. When the discount is increased to 7%, then the selling price will become `.93x` and the profit earned will be `0.93x - x/20 - 15`.   
As per the question, `19x/20 - (0.93x - x/20 - 15) = 15`   
On solving, `x = 500`. Therefore, the marked price of the watch is `105% of 500 = Rs. 750`. Thus, the correct answer is D.

Response 8:
Firstly, we can use the formula for average speed which is:
 
 average speed = (total distance traveled) / (total time taken)

Let's assume that the man traveled "x" km at 5 km/h and "y" km at 4 km/h. 
According to the given information, we can create two equations as follows:

Equation 1: x/5 = 6
x = 30 km

Equation 2: y/4 = 12
y = 48 km

Now, we can substitute the values of x and y in the formula for average speed:

average speed = (x + y) / (6 + 12)
average speed = (30 + 48) / 18

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
Let x be the selling price per component in dollars. The profit P in dollars for each component sold is: 

P = x - 110 

So, for 1 month, the profit per component will be: 

30 * (x - 110) 

The revenue from selling 420 units of the component each month will be: 

420x 

Then, the profit for the whole year will be: 

12(420x - 30 * 110 * 420) = 12(420x - 1386000) 

We want this to be at least 626400, so: 

12(420x - 1386000) >= 626400 

Simplifying, we get: 

420x >= 234000 

So, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least 626400 is: 

x >= 234000/420 = 556.19 

Rounding up to the nearest dollar gives us: 

556.19 --> 557 

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component is $557. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
First we need to find the annual production cost which is: 420 * 12 * $110 = $554,400

Then we can find the minimum revenue required to reach a profit of $626,400
Profit = Revenue - Production Cost  =>  $626,400 = Revenue - $554,400  =>  $1,180,800 = Revenue 

Since the company produces 420 units per month, it produces a total of 5,040 units per year (420 units/month x 12 months). 

To meet the target revenue of $1,180,800, the minimum selling price per component should be: 
$1,180,800 ÷ 5,040 components = $234

Action: Answer("None of the above (the answer is $234)")
Response 3:
Let us calculate the annual revenue as follows: 

Annual production cost = 110 x 420 x 12  
                          = 554,400  
  
Let the selling price per component be x dollars.  

The monthly revenue from selling 420 components at x dollars is 420x dollars.  
Thus, the annual revenue from selling 420 components at x dollars is 420x x 12 dollars.  
Therefore, the annual profit after paying the production cost and selling 420 components at x dollars is:  

420x x 12 - 554,400  

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee an annual profit of at least $626,400, we have to solve the following inequality for x: 

420x x 12 - 554,400  >=  626,400  

5040x - 110,400  >=  52,200  
5040x  >=  162,600  
x  >=  162,600/5040  
x  >=  32.26  

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit is at least $626,400 is $33 or more.  

Action: Answer("None of the above")  - since none of the given options is equal to or greater than $33.
Response 4:
Let "p" be the selling price per component.
The profit per month for each component sold is p - 110.
So the profit per month for 420 components is 420 * (p - 110).
The profit per year would be 12 * 420 * (p - 110), which simplifies to 5040p - 554400.
We want this profit to be at least $626,400, so we can set up this inequality:
5040p - 554400 >= 626400
Simplifying this inequality, we get:
5040p >= 1180800
Dividing both sides by 5040, we get:
p >= 234.4
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit is at least $626,400 is $234.4. 

Action: Answer("None of the above") [Correct answer is $234.4 but closest option is not available]
Response 5:
Let P be the minimum selling price per component.
In one month, the total revenue (profit) for the company is (420)(P) and the total production cost is (420)($110) = $46,200. Therefore, the monthly profit is (420)(P) - $46,200, and the yearly profit is (12)[(420)(P) - $46,200] = 5,040P - $554,400.
We want this yearly profit to be at least $626,400.
So, we have the inequality:
5,040P - $554,400 ≥ $626,400
5,040P ≥ $1,180,800
P ≥ $234
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component should be $234.
Action: Answer("None of the above") [The answer should be $234 which is not listed in the choices given]
Response 6:
Let's start by finding the yearly production cost for 420 units/month.
420 units/month * $110/unit = $46,200/month
$46,200/month * 12 months/year = $554,400/year (Production cost)

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to use the following formula:
Profit = Revenue - Production Cost
$626,400 = Revenue - $554,400
Revenue = $1,180,800/year

Now we can determine the minimum selling price per component:
$1,180,800/year ÷ 5,040 units/year (420/month * 12 months) = $234.92 ≈ $235

The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $235.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Let SP be the minimum selling price per component.
 
From the given information, we can calculate the yearly production cost as:
 
420 components per month * $110 per component * 12 months = $554,400
 
To make a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the yearly revenue from selling the components has to be:
 
$554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800
 
The revenue per component is SP * 420 components per month. The yearly revenue from selling the components can also be expressed as:
 
SP * 420 components per month * 12 months = $1,180,800
 
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
 
SP = $1,180,800 / (420 * 12) = $233.33
 
The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is: 
 
Action: Answer("A") 226
Response 8:
Let's calculate the annual production cost first:
420 units/month * 12 months/year * $110/unit = $554,400/year

Adding the minimum required yearly profit of $626,400 to the annual production cost, we get:
$554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800/year

Dividing this by the total number of units produced every year, we get the minimum selling price per component:
$1,180,800/year ÷ 420 units/month ÷ 12 months/year = $230/unit

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Let the minimum selling price per component be $x. 
The yearly revenue from sales is (12 months) x (420 units/month) x ($x/unit) = $5,040x.
The yearly production cost is (12 months) x (420 units/month) x ($110/unit) = $554,400.
The yearly profit is revenue minus production cost which is:
$5,040x - $554,400 >= $626,400
Simplifying the inequality, we get:
$5,040x >= $1,180,800
x >= $234.343434...
The smallest choice from the given options that is greater than $234.343434... is $240.

x = m/100 * 4y = 4my/100
Now, let's find the value of m in terms of x:
m% of x = m/100 * x
Substitute the value of x:
= m/100 * 4my/100
= 4m(y/100)^2
= 4(y/10)^2 * m
= 4(1/100 * y)^2 * m

x = 4ym/100  
x = 0.04ym  

Now we can find what percentage of x m is in terms of y:  

m = (x/y) * 100  
m = (0.04ym / y) * 100  
m = 0.04m * 100  
m = 4

Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's start with the information given in the question:
x = m% * 4y
We need to find what percentage m is of x. 
We can use the formula for percentage:
percentage = (part/whole) * 100%
We want to find the part which is m and the whole which is x. 
part = m and whole = x = m% * 4y.
Substituting the value of x, we get:
part = m and whole = m% * 4y
percentage = (part/whole) * 100%
percentage = m / (m% * 4y) * 100%

Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation:
percentage = (m / (m% * 4y)) * 100%
percentage = (m / (m / 100 * 4y)) * 100%
percentage = (m / (m/25y)) * 100%
percentage = (m * 25y / m) * 100%
percentage = 2500y / m

Therefore, Answer: Answer("D")
Response 9:
First, we can write x as m/100 * 4y. Then, to find the percentage that m represents of x, we divide m/100 * 4y by x and multiply by 100:

Explanation: 
Let's start by calculating the commission that the sales person receives from one sale:
10% of $250 = $25
Now we can find out how many sales the sales person needs to make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000:
$1000 ÷ $25 per sale = 40 sales

Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Solution:

Let's assume that the salesperson makes 'x' sales of $250 each. 

The commission on each sale = 10% of $250 = $25
Total commission earned on 'x' sales = $25x

We need to find out the value of 'x' for which the salesperson earns a salary of at least $1000.

His salary consists of the base salary + commission earned on sales.
Given, the required salary is at least $1000
So, Base salary + Commission earned on sales >= $1000  

Substituting the values, we get:
$250x + $25x >= $1000
Simplifying this, we get:
$275x >= $1000
x >= 1000/275
x >= 36.36

So, the salesperson should make at least 37 sales to earn a salary of at least $1000 (since he can't make a fraction of a sale and need to make the next higher integer sale). 

Answer: Answer("None of the above") - The closest option is 40, but the correct answer is 37.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We can begin solving the problem by setting up an equation where x is the number of sales the salesperson needs to make to reach a salary of at least $1000. 

The commission on each sale is 10% of $250, which is $25. So, the salesperson earns $25x from x sales. 

To reach a salary of at least $1000, we set up the following inequality:

$25x \geq 1000$

Divide both sides by 25:

$x \geq 40$

Therefore, the salesperson must make at least 40 sales to earn a salary of at least $1000.

Response 8:
First, notice that M and N are three-digit numbers with $c > 0$.  Since $M > N$, $a > b$, or else $M \leq N$.  Let $a = b + x$ for some integer $x\geq 1$.  Then, \[M - N = 99x > 0\]which implies that $x \geq 1$.

Notice that $c \leq 3$, since $396c > 990$.  Thus, the possibilities for $(a,b,c)$ are $(9,1,1), (8,2,1), (8,1,2), (7,3,1), (7,2,2), (7,1,3), (6,4,1),$ $(6,3,2), (6,2,3), (6,1,4), (5,4,2), (5,3,3), (5,2,4),$ $(5,1,5), (4,3,4),$ $(4,2,5),$ and $(4,1,8)$. Among these $18$ possibilities, only $(a,b,c) = (9,1,1)$, $(8,2,1)$, $(7,3,1)$, $(6,4,1)$, and $(5,4,2)$ satisfy $a > b$.

Let $(a,b,c) = (9,1,1)$.  Then, $M = 819$ and $N = 918$.  Plugging into $M - N + 396c = 990$ yields $c = 2$.  Among three digit integers of the form $9xy$ with $x \geq 2$ and $y \leq 1$, we have $901, 902$, $911, 912, 913,$ and $921$.  The only integer greater than $300$ here is $901$.

Similarly, if $(a,b,c) = (8,2,1)$, then $N = 928$ and $M = 820$.  Thus, $c = 2$, and $M$ exceeds $300$ if and only if $821, 831, 841,$ or $851$.

If $(a,b,c) = (7,3,1)$, then $N = 738$ and $M = 730$.  Thus, $c = 8$, and $M$ exceeds $300$ if and only if $781$ or $791$.

If $(a,b,c) = (6,4,1)$, then $N = 648$ and $M = 640$.  So, $c = 8$.  There are no integers of the form $6xy$ greater than $300$ here.

If $(a,b,c) = (5,4,2)$, then $N = 254$ and $M = 452$.  Thus, $c = 3$, and there are no integers of the form $5xy$ greater than $300$.

In total, we get that there are $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 20}$ possible values of $M$ that are greater than $300$.

Question: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 240
  C: 30
  D: 60
  E: 120
Response 0:
We can use the formula: time = distance / speed  
Converting 12 miles per hour to minutes, we have 12 miles per 60 minutes or 0.2 miles per minute.  
Therefore, time = 48 miles / 0.2 miles per minute = 240 minutes.  

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
To solve this problem we can use the formula: 

time = distance / speed 

where distance is given in miles and speed is given in miles per hour (mph).

Given the distance is 48 miles and the speed is 12 mph, we have:

time = 48 miles / 12 mph = 4 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we can multiply the result by 60:

time in minutes = 4 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("B") 240.
Response 3:
First we can calculate the time in hours that it takes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles by dividing the distance by the speed:

48 miles ÷ 12 miles per hour = 4 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we can multiply by 60:

4 hours × 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes

Therefore, the answer is (B) 240.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

First, we need to convert the cyclist's speed from miles per hour to miles per minute. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so to convert miles per hour to miles per minute we divide by 60. 

12 miles per hour ÷ 60 = 0.2 miles per minute

Now we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

time = 48 / 0.2

time = 240 minutes

Therefore, it will take 240 minutes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
First we need to convert the cycling speed to miles per minute. To do that we'll divide by 60.

12 miles/hour = (12/60) miles/minute = 0.2 miles/minute

Now we can use the formula distance = speed × time to calculate the time needed to travel 48 miles.

48 miles = 0.2 miles/minute × time

time = 48 miles / (0.2 miles/minute) = 240 minutes

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
To solve the problem, we can use the formula:
time = distance/speed

Substituting the given values, we get:
time = 48/12

Simplifying, we get:
time = 4 hours

But the question asks for the time in minutes, so we need to convert hours to minutes:
time = 4 x 60 minutes

Therefore:
time = 240 minutes

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 7:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

where distance is in miles and speed is in miles per hour.

Action: Answer("E") 

To solve the problem, we plug in the given values:

time = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour = 4 hours

We need to convert the result to minutes, since the choices are given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so:

time = 4 hours × 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes.

Therefore, the answer is E: 120.
Response 8:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula:
time = distance ÷ speed

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
distance = 48 miles
speed = 12 miles per hour

Substitute the values in the formula above:
time = distance ÷ speed
time = 48 ÷ 12
time = 4 hours

Since we want the answer in minutes, we can convert 4 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:
time = 4 x 60
time = 240 minutes

Therefore, the answer is E: 120.
Response 9:
The cyclist's speed: 

`12 miles per hour = 12/60 = 0.2 miles per minute`

To travel 48 miles: 

`t = d / s = 48 / 0.2 = 240 minutes`

Response 5:
We can solve this problem through the following steps:
Let’s say C joined the business after x months. Therefore, B joined the business (12-2-x)=10-x months before the end of the financial year.
Now, let’s calculate the ratio of the shares of A, B and C after calculating C’s share.
(A+B+C) : (A+B+C) = 375000 : (375000-150000) => 1:1/2
C’s share is 1/2 of the total. Therefore, the remaining profit is also 1/2 of the total.
Therefore, A and B’s share can be calculated as follows:
Ratio of shares of A and B = Ratio of the remaining profit = 1:1
Total sum of A and B’s share = 375000-150000 = 225000
Therefore, A and B’s combined share = 225000 / 2 = 112500
A’s share after C joined = A/(A+B+C) * (375000-150000) = 112500
(This is because A’s share cannot change after C joined)
Therefore, B’s share after C joined = 112500 - 40000 (initial investment of A) = 72500
(Because B invested Rs.60,000. Therefore, B’s profit = Total profit - A’s profit - C’s profit = (375000-150000-112500) = 112500. Therefore, B’s share = (72500/ 112500) * 112500 = 72500)
Now, let’s calculate the share of C for the period after he joined.
C’s profit = C/(A+B+C) * (375000-150000) = 150,000.
Therefore, C joined after 4 months (10-x + 2 + x).
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let’s start by finding out the ratio of the amount invested by the partners. A’s initial investment of Rs.40,000 is for 12 months, so he has invested a total of Rs.40,000 x 12 = Rs.480,000. B has invested Rs.60,000 for only 10 months (since he joined after A had already worked for 2 months), so his total investment is Rs.60,000 x 10 = Rs.600,000. Let’s assume that C joined the business after ‘m’ months, and was there for the remaining 12 - m months.
Now, let’s add up the total investment:
A + B = Rs. 480,000 + Rs. 600,000 = 1,080,000
A + B + C = Rs. 1,080,000 + Rs.120,000 = Rs.1,200,000
Let the ratio of the partnership be a:b:c
a/b = 480,000/600,000 = 4/5
c/b = 150000 / (375000 - 150000) [The remaining profits must be split between A, B and C in the ratio a:b:c]
c/b = 3/7
We also know that a + b + c = 1,200,000
Using these equations, we can solve for ‘m’:
a/b = 4/5
c/b = 3/7
Adding the two equations:
a/b + c/b = 4/5 + 3/7
=> (7a + 5c) / 7b = 59/35
=> 35(7a + 5c) = 59(7b)
=> 245a + 175c = 413b
a + b + c = 1,200,000
Substituting a = (4/5)b, c = (3/7)b
(4/5)b + b + (3/7)b = 1,200,000
(59/35)b = 1,200,000
b = 711,268.29
c/b = 3/7
c = (3/7)b = 304,439.41
Total time for which C was in business = 12 months
Let ‘n’ be the number of months after B joined that C joined the business
We know that B has invested for 2 months more than A and C has invested for 12 - m months
So, we can write:
480000(12) + 600000(12 - n) + 120000(12 - m) = 375000n + 150000(12)
Simplifying:
2880000 + 7200000 - 600000n + 1440000 - 120000m = 375000n + 1800000
=> 315000n = 4260000 + 120000m - 10080000
=> 21n = 2400 - 8m
From the given options, only ‘B’ satisfies this equation:
2400 - 8m = 4 x 600
=> 8m = 2400 - 2400 = 0
=> m = 0
Thus, C joined the business immediately after B joined. Answer: Answer("B")

Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 62
  C: 82
  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Let N be the first integer in the sequence, then the sum of the next k consecutive integers can be expressed as k(N+1/2). We are given N=-50 and k(N+1/2)=51. Substituting N=-50, we have k(-49/2)=51, which simplifies to k=-204/49. This is not one of the choices, which implies that there's an error in the problem. Thus, we cannot find k using the given information. Hence, Answer("None of the Above").
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let n be the first integer, then the sum of k consecutive integers is given by k*(n + (n+k-1))/2. Thus, we have k*(-50 + (-50 +k-1))/2 = 51. 
Simplifying this we get k*(k-99) = -204. We see that -204 is negative, hence the product k*(k-99) can be negative only if one of the factors is negative and the other is positive. Without loss of generality, let’s assume that k-99 is negative and k+12 is positive, which gives us k = 13. Thus, the answer is Action: Answer("E").
Response 3:
First, we need to determine the sum of k consecutive integers that starts with -50. 

The sum of k consecutive integers where the first integer is a and the last integer is b can be found using the formula:
sum = (k / 2) * (a + b)

We know that the first integer is -50. Let's assume that the last integer is x. We don't know the value of k yet, but we do know that the sum is 51.

51 = (k / 2) * (-50 + x)

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 2 and dividing both sides by 51.

2(51) / 51 = k / 2
2 = k / 2
k = 4

Therefore, the sum of 4 consecutive integers starting from -50 is 51. These integers are: -50, -49, -48, -47.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Here's how we can solve: Let's assume that the k terms are starting from `n` to `n+k-1`. Then the sum of these k terms are k * (2n+k-1)/2. We are given that the sum of these k terms is 51, so we can form the following equation:

`k*(2n+k-1) = 102`

As `n` is given to be `-50`, we can rewrite the above equation further:

`k*(k-1) = 204`

Let's try to factorize `204` into our equation:

`204 = 3*4*17`

So we can have the following possible different values of `k`:

`k*(k-1) = 3*4*17`
- k = 13 or -14

We need to choose `k` to be a positive integer as we are counting the number of consecutive integers. Also we know that the least of the terms is given as `-50`. Therefore, we can rule out `-14` and choose the other answer which gives us `k = 13`.

Hence the answer is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let's use the formula for the sum of consecutive integers: S = n/2(2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, d is the common difference and S is the sum of the terms. 

We know that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51, so we have:

S = 51
a = -50
d = 1 (since the integers are consecutive)

Substituting these values into the formula we get:

51 = k/2(-99 + (k-1)*1)

Simplifying and solving for k:

102 = -99k + k^2 - k
0 = k^2 - 100k + 102

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

k = (100 ± sqrt(100^2 - 4(1)(102)))/2
k = (100 ± sqrt(9604))/2
k = (100 ± 98)/2

We reject the negative value since we're looking for the number of terms and it can't be negative. Therefore:

k = (100 + 98)/2
k = 98/2
k = 49

So the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
First, we need to find the value of the consecutive integers. Let's assume that the number of consecutive integers is n. Then, the sum of the first n consecutive integers is n/2 * [2*(-50)+(n-1)]. We know that this sum is equal to 51. 

n/2 * [2*(-50)+(n-1)] = 51 

Simplifying the equation: 

n^2 - 99n + 102 = 0 

Solving for n using the quadratic formula: 

n = [99 ± sqrt(99^2 - 4*1*102)] / 2 

n = [99 ± sqrt(9801 - 408)] / 2 

n = [99 ± sqrt(9393)] / 2 

n ≈ 3.06 or n ≈ 95.94 

We know that n has to be a positive integer, so the correct value is 

Action: Answer("D") 
Response 9:
Here's how we can solve the problem:

Let's assume that there are 'k' integers, which start at -50 and end at some number 'n'. Then, we can write an equation based on the given information:

-50 + (-49) + (-48) + ..... + n = 51

Now, let's simplify this equation by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = (number of terms) * (average of terms)

The average of the first and last terms in this series is (n - 50)/2. Since there are 'k' terms in this series, we can write:

51 = k * (n - 50)/2

Multiplying both sides by 2 and solving for k, we get:

k = 102/(n - 50)

Since 'k' must be a positive integer, 'n' must be greater than -50, and the denominator (n - 50) must be a factor of 102. The factors of 102 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 17, 34, 51, and 102.

The only factor that is greater than -50 is 17. Therefore, we get:

n - 50 = 17

n = 67

So, there are 18 integers (-50 to 67), and k = 18.

Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let the side of the square cloth be "x". When 4 feet is trimmed on one side, a rectangle with dimension of (x-4) by x is created. When this rectangle is cut in half diagonally, two triangles with base and height (x-4) are created. 
Area of a triangle = (1/2) x base x height 
70 = (1/2) x (x-4) x (x-4)
140 = (x-4)^2
Taking square root on both sides, we have:
x - 4 =sqrt(140)
x = sqrt(140) + 4
Perimeter of the original square cloth is 4x = 4 x (sqrt(140) + 4) = 4sqrt(140) +16

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let's call the side length of the original square piece of cloth "x". 

When we trim 4 feet off one edge, we are left with a rectangle that has one side length of "x-4". The other side length remains "x". 

Using the formula for the area of a triangle (Area = 1/2 * base * height), we know that the two triangles have an area of 70 square feet each. 

We can set up an equation based on this information: 

1/2 * (x-4) * h = 70 

where "h" represents the height of each triangle. 

Solving for "h", we get: 

h = 140 / (x-4) 

Now, let's use the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the side lengths of the original square piece of cloth to the side lengths of the triangles: 

(x-4)^2 + h^2 = x^2 

Substituting the expression for "h" that we found earlier: 

(x-4)^2 + (140/(x-4))^2 = x^2 

Expanding and simplifying: 

x^4 - 8x^3 + 32x^2 - 11200 = 0 

This equation can be factored as: 

(x-50)(x^3 - 8x^2 + 232x + 224) = 0 

The only real solution for "x" (since we can't have negative side lengths) is "x=50". 

Therefore, the original square piece of cloth had a side length of 50 feet. 

The perimeter of this square is 4 times the side length, or 200 feet. 

When we trim 4 feet off one edge, we are left with a rectangle that has side lengths of 46 feet and 50 feet. 

Using the Pythagorean Theorem again, we can find that the length of each diagonal is 78. 

Finally, we cut this rectangle diagonally in half to create two triangles, each with a base of 46 feet and a height of 140/46 feet. 

The perimeter of both triangles combined is: 

2 * (46 + 2*sqrt((140/46)^2 + 46^2)) 

Simplifying this expression gives approximately 125.7 feet. 

Therefore, the closest answer choice is Answer("D"): 62.
Response 3:
Let the original side of the square be x. Then, after trimming, the side of the rectangular piece is (x-4). The area of the rectangular piece is x(x-4). The two triangles are congruent, so each has area (1/2)(x-4)(x/2). We are given that this area is 70, so we have:

(1/2)(x-4)(x/2) = 70 

Simplifying, we get:

(x-4)(x/2) = 140
x^2 - 4x - 560 = 0
(x-28)(x+20) = 0

Since x is a length, it must be positive, so we take x = 28 as our answer. Therefore, the original piece of cloth was a square of side 28 feet and perimeter 4 * 28 = 112 feet, so the answer is:

Action: Answer("A") 
Response 4:
To solve the problem we need to set up the area of the square piece of cloth equal to $(s)^2$, where s is the length of the side of the square. The area of each of the triangles is given by $\frac{1}{2}(s-4)x = 70$, where x is the length of the other side of the rectangle. Solving for x, we get $x = \frac{140}{s-4}$. 

The diagonal of the rectangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem: $d^2 = x^2 + (s-4)^2$. Substituting $x$ in the equation, we get $d^2 = \frac{19600}{(s-4)^2} + (s-4)^2$.

Since the rectangle is cut into two equal triangles, the legs of each of the two triangles are equal to $x$ and the hypotenuse of each of the two triangle is equal to $d$. Therefore, we have that $2x + 2d = s$. Substituting $x$ and $d$ we get:

$2\left(\frac{140}{s-4}\right) + 2\left(\sqrt{\frac{19600}{(s-4)^2} + (s-4)^2}\right) = s$

Multiplying both sides by $\frac{(s-4)^2}{280}$, we get:

$\frac{19600}{s-4} + (s-4)^3 = \frac{(s-4)^2}{140} \cdot s$

Simplifying the equation, we obtain:

$s^3 - 10s^2 + 136s - 736 = 0$

Factoring the polynomial gives, $(s-8)(s^2-2s+92) = 0$, and $s=8$ or $s=1\pm \sqrt{91}$. We discard the larger root since it does not make sense in the context of the problem (the side of the square piece of cloth cannot be negative). Thus, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth was $4s = 4(8) = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 60}$.
Response 5:
We can solve the problem by finding the length of the side of the square cloth and adding up all its sides. Let a be the length of the side of the square cloth. Then, after the rectangular piece is formed, one side of the resulting rectangle is equal to a - 4, and the other side is equal to a. Also, since the rectangle is formed by trimming a square, we have:
a - (a - 4) = 4
Solving for a gives a = 8, so the length of the side of the square cloth is 8 feet. The perimeter of the original square cloth is then 4a = 32 feet. Alternatively, we could find the lengths of the sides of the rectangular piece using the Pythagorean theorem, and then add up all the sides. We would get the same answer. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let's suppose the side of the square cloth before trimming is represented by x feet. 

After being trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, we get a rectangular piece with dimensions of (x-4) by x. 

If we cut this rectangular piece diagonally, we get two right triangles with legs x-4 and x. 

Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we can solve for x using the area formula:
(area of a triangle) = 1/2 * base * height
70 = 1/2 * (x-4) * x   or   70 = 1/2 * x * (x-4)
Multiplying both sides by 2 and expanding, we get:
0 = x^2 - 4x - 140
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
x = (4 ± sqrt(16 + 560)) / 2
x = 10 or x = -14 (we reject the negative solution)

Therefore, the side of the original square cloth is 10 feet. And the perimeter of the original square is 4*x = 40 feet. 

But we trimmed 4 feet from one edge, so the trimmed rectangle has dimensions of 6 by 10, and the perimeter of that rectangle is 2*(6+10) = 32. 

Therefore, the total amount trimmed from the perimeter is 40-32 = 8 feet. 

Finally, we cut this rectangle into two right triangles, so each has hypotenuse sqrt(6^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(136). 

Thus, the total perimeter of the original square cloth is 40 + 2*sqrt(136), which is approximately 60.42 feet. 

Since none of the choices match exactly, the closest answer is (C) 60.
Response 7:
Let the side of the square piece of cloth be x.
The new rectangular piece has dimensions x and x-4.
The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height. Here, both triangles have the same area of 70 sq.ft.
So, (1/2) * b * h = 70
From the rectangle diagram, we can see that b = 2(x-4) and h = x.
Putting the value of b and h in the above equation, we get:
(1/2) * 2(x-4) * x = 70
Simplifying, we get x^2 - 4x - 70 = 0
Solving this quadratic equation, we get x = 10 or x = -7 (neglecting the negative value).
Therefore, the original square piece of cloth had a side of 10 feet.
Hence, the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth = 4 * 10 = 40 feet.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let's first find out the dimensions of the rectangular piece. 

Let x be the side of the original square piece of cloth. After trimming 4 feet, one side of the rectangle becomes (x-4) and the other side remains x. 

The area of each triangle is given as 70 sq feet. Therefore, the total area of the rectangular piece is 2*(70) = 140 sq feet. 

We know that the area (A) of a rectangle is given by A = length * width. So, 

length * width = 140

(x-4) * x = 140

x^2 - 4x = 140

x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0

Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get 

x = 14 or x = -10 (disregarding the negative value)

So, the original piece of cloth was a square with a side length of 14 feet. 

The perimeter of a square with a side length of 14 feet is 4 * 14 = 56 feet.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:
  A: 46
  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
Let the width of the parking space be w in feet.
Since there are two widths and one length of the parking space painted we have the equation: 
2w + L = 37, where L is the length of the parking space
L = 37 - 2w (Equation 1)

Also, the length and width of the parking space must add up to the length of the unpainted side of 9 feet. Thus, we have:
L + w = 9 (Equation 2)

Substituting Equation 1 in Equation 2, we have: 
(37 - 2w) + w = 9

Solving for w, we get:
w = 14

Substituting w = 14 in Equation 1, we get: 
L = 37 - 2(14) = 9

The area of the parking space : w * L = 14 * 9 = 126

Hence the answer is Action: Answer("C") which is 126.
Response 1:
Let's assume that the length of the parking space is "L" and the width of the parking space is "W". Then we can form two equations from the given information:

Length of unpainted side: 2W + L = 37 - 3L
Length of unpainted side: L = 9

We can substitute the value of "L" in the first equation and solve for "W":

2W + 9 = 37 - 3(9)
2W + 9 = 10
2W = 1
W = 0.5

So the area of the parking space is:

Area = L * W = 9 * 0.5 = 4.5

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let the length and width of the rectangular parking space be "L" and "W" respectively.
Given that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, we have L = 9 + 2W.
Also, the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, we have 2L + W = 37.
Substituting the value of L in the second equation, we get:
2(9+2W) + W = 37
18 + 5W = 37
5W = 19
W = 3.8 feet (rounded to one decimal place)
L = 9 + 2W = 9 + 2(3.8) = 16.6 feet (rounded to one decimal place)
Therefore, the area of the parking space is A = L x W = 16.6 x 3.8 = 63.08 square feet (rounded to two decimal places)
Answer: Answer("E") - The correct answer is not one of the provided choices.
Response 3:
We can solve this using the formula for the area of a rectangle. Let's call the length of the rectangle "L" and the width "W". We know that one side (the unpainted side) has a length of 9 feet. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we have:

2L + W = 37

We can rearrange this equation to solve for W:

W = 37 - 2L

Now we can substitute this expression for W into the formula for the area of a rectangle:

A = LW

A = L(37 - 2L)

A = 37L - 2L^2

To find the maximum area of the rectangle, we can take the derivative of the area function and set it equal to zero:

A' = 37 - 4L = 0

L = 9.25

This is the length of the rectangle that gives the maximum area. Now we can plug this value of L back into the area formula to find the maximum area:

A = 37(9.25) - 2(9.25)^2
A = 342.25 - 170.5
A = 171.75

Therefore, the area of the parking space is approximately 171.75 square feet.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let's call the length of the painted sides x and y, where x is the length and y is the width.
From the question, we know that x + 2y = 37 (the sum of the lengths of the painted sides).
We also know that y = 9 (the length of the unpainted side).
We can substitute y = 9 in the equation for the sum of painted sides:
x + 2y = 37
x + 2(9) = 37
x + 18 = 37
x = 19
So the length of the rectangle is x = 19 feet, and the width is y = 9 feet.
Therefore, the area of the rectangle is A = xy = 19*9 = 171 square feet.
Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("E") (None of the above, as the correct answer is 171 which is not one of the given choices).
Response 5:
We are given that one of the sides is unpainted and is 9 feet and that the sum of the lengths of the other two sides is 37 feet. We want to find the area of the rectangle.  

Let's call the length of the rectangle L and the width of the rectangle W. Since the unpainted side has length 9, either L = 9 or W = 9. Let's assume W = 9. Then we have L + 2W = 37. Substituting W = 9, we have L + 18 = 37  => L = 37 - 18 = 19. Thus we have L = 19 and W = 9.  

Finally, the area of the rectangle is given by A = L x W = 19 x 9 = 171 square feet. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let L, W be the length and the width of the rectangle parking space, respectively.

We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so W=9.

The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so 2L + W = 37.

Substituting W=9, we get 2L + 9 = 37, so 2L = 28, and L=14.

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is LW = 14*9 = 126 square feet.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
First, we can determine that the sum of the lengths of the two painted sides is 37 - 9 = 28 feet. We can then set up the equation 2x + y = 28, where x is the width of the parking space and y is the length. Solving for y, we get y = 28 - 2x. We also know that the unpainted side (which is a length) has a length of 9 feet, so y = 9. Substituting this value for y, we have 9 = 28 - 2x, or 2x = 19, or x = 9.5. Therefore, the area of the parking space is 9.5 x 9 = 85.5 square feet, which is closest to choice A: 46. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Solution: Let the length and width of the parking space be l and w respectively. The painted sides are l, w and l+w-9. The length of the unpainted side is w, so w = 9. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is l + w + l + w + 9 = 2l + 2w + 9 = 2(l+w) + 9. Therefore, 2(l+w) + 9 = 37, or 2(l+w) = 28. Hence, l+w = 14. The area of the parking space is l * w = 9(l+w-9) = 9(14-9) = 9x5 = 45. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is: 
perimeter = 2(length + width)

Let L be the length of the rectangle, and W be the width. We know that the unpainted side has a length of 9 feet, so W = 9.

We are given that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we can write the equation: 

2L + W = 37

Substituting W = 9, we have: 

2L + 9 = 37 

Solving for L, we get L = 14. 

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is A = L x W = 14 x 9 = 126 square feet.

Let's assume that the length of the yard is L feet.
We know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = length * width.
Given that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide, we can write:
A = 100 * L = 100L
We also know that the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. Thus:
A = 3,000
Equating the two expressions for A, we get:
100L = 3,000
Dividing both sides by 100, we get:
L = 30

We are given A = 3000 sq. feet and w=100 feet. Let's substitute these values in the formula and solve for l.

A = l*w
3000 = l*100
l = 3000/100

We can start the problem by using the formula for the area of a rectangle:
Area = length x width

We are given that:
- One side of the yard is 100 feet wide
- The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet

We can use these two pieces of information to write an equation to solve for the length of the yard:
3,000 = length x 100

To solve for the length, we can divide both sides of the equation by 100:
length = 3,000 ÷ 100

Simplifying the expression, we get:
length = 30

Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

Question: Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is?
Choices:
  A: 21
  B: 33
  C: 35
  D: 42
  E: 58
Response 0:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x.
According to the problem, (3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12 / 23.
Solving the equation for x, we get x = 46.
Therefore, the smaller number is 3x - 9 = 3(46) - 9 = 129.
Hence, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9. It is given that (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Cross multiplying, we get 69x - 207 = 60x - 108, which gives x = 27. Therefore, the smaller number is 3x - 9 = 78. 

Action: Answer("None of the above") (The correct answer is not in the choices given, the actual answer is 78)
Response 2:
Let's assume the two numbers are 3x and 5x. According to the question, if 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are 12y and 23y, where y = (3x-9)/(5x-9).
We can simplify the above equation and get y=28/31. Now we can find the value of x by setting 3x/(5x)=28/31. Solving for x, we get x=124/15. Therefore, the smaller number is 3x=124/5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let the original numbers be 3x and 5x. Then we are told that (3x-9) is to (5x-9) as 12 is to 23. That is:

(3x-9) / (5x-9) = 12/23

Cross-multiplying gives:

23(3x-9) = 12(5x-9)

Expanding and simplifying both sides gives:

69x - 207 = 60x - 108

9x = 99

x=11

So the smaller original number is 3x = 33.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let's assume the two numbers be 3x and 5x (as they are in the ratio 3:5).
Accordingly, (3x-9) and (5x-9) will be the new numbers after subtracting 9 from each.
It is also given that their new ratio is 12:23.
Then, we get the following equation - 
(3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23
By solving this equation, we get x=23.
Hence, the smaller number is 3x = 3*23 = 69

Therefore, the answer is A: 21.
Response 5:
Let the numbers initially be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, we get (3x-9) and (5x-9). As per the second ratio, we got (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23 

Solving for x, we can get x = 69
So the smaller number initially is 3x = 207

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. When 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio is (3x-9):(5x-9) which is equal to 12:23. 
Thus, (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. 
Solving the above equation, we get x = 69.
Hence, the smaller number is 3x = 3*69 = 207.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, the numbers become 3x-9 and 5x-9. We are given that the ratio of (3x-9) to (5x-9) is 12 to 23. Therefore, we can write an equation:
(3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23
Cross-multiplying, we get:
23(3x-9) = 12(5x-9)
Simplifying, we get:
29x = 207
So, x = 9. 

Therefore, the smaller number (3x) is 27. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's suppose the two numbers in the ratio 3:5 are 3x and 5x. By applying the given information, we can set up the following equation:

\begin{equation*}
\frac{3x-9}{5x-9} = \frac{12}{23}

We can solve this question using Vieta's formulas: If a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 has roots r1 and r2, then r1 + r2 = -b/a and r1*r2 = c/a.
We know that one of the roots is 1.5 and the other root is r2, so we have:
r1 + r2 = 1.5 + r2 = -m/1
r2 = (-1.5 - m)
r1 * r2 = 22/1
1.5 * (-1.5 - m) = 22

Response 4:
To solve the quadratic equation, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots is equal to the negative coefficient of x, divided by the coefficient of x^2. 

Let's call the other root of the equation r. Then, we know that:

1.5 + r = -m/1
r = -m/1 - 1.5

We also know that the product of the roots is equal to the constant term of the equation (which is 22), divided by the coefficient of x^2 (which is 1):

1.5r = 22/1
r = 44/3

Now we can substitute this expression for r into the equation we derived earlier:

- m/1 - 1.5 = 44/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:

-3m/1 - 4.5 = 44/1

Now we can simplify and solve for m:

-3m/1 = 44/1 + 4.5

-3m/1 = 48.5

m = -48.5/3

The sum of the roots can also be found using the fact that (p+q)=-b/a. Therefore, 1.5+14.6667=-m/1 or m=-16.1667.

Let the total population of deer in the forest be x. Then we can set up the equation (300/x) = (20/500), since only 20 out of the 500 deer were tagged from the previous year. Solving for x, we get x = 7500.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
First, we can use the information that 20 of the 500 deer caught in 2002 had been tagged in 2001 to estimate the percent of deer in the forest that had been tagged in 2001: 20/500 = 4%. This is our estimate for the proportion of the forest population that was tagged in 2001.

To estimate the total population of the forest, we can start by using the tagged deer from 2001 to estimate the population of deer that were in the forest in 2001. If x is the total population of the forest in 2001, and we know that 300 deer were tagged, then we can set up the proportion 300/x = 0.04, and solve for x:
300/x = 0.04
x = 300/0.04
x = 7500

So our estimate for the total deer population in the forest is 7500. Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("E").

Response 2:
The better approach to solve the above problem is, Let the remainder obtained be x. Then, 2272 - x and 875 - x are both divisible by N. Hence, N is a factor of (2272 - x) and (875 - x).
2272 - 875 = 1397.
Let's write all the possible pairs of factors of 1397 in the form of (2272 - x) and (875 - x).
(1397, 1), (199, 7), (49, 29).
Now, let's see for which pairs of factors of 1397, sum of digits is a 3 digit number as N is a 3 digit number.
=> for (1397, 1), the sum of digits in N is 1+3+9+7 = 20
=> for (199, 7), the sum of digits in N is 1+9+9+7 = 26.
=> for (49, 29), the sum of digits in N is 4+9+2+9 = 24.
Thus the sum of the digits of N is 20 (Option A). 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
First, we need to find the HCF of (2272 - 875) = 1397 and the 3-digit number N.
1397 = (3 × 11 × 43)
Divisors of 1397: 1, 1397.
Thus, the HCF between them can only be 1.


Now, when both 2272 and 875 are divided by N, the remainder is the same.
So, we can say that (2272 - 875) has a remainder 0 when divided by N.


Now, 1397 has no factors between 99 and 1000 other than 1.
Thus, we assume N = 1397.


Now, dividing 2272 and 875 by 1397, we get the same remainder of 2272 and 875.


So, the sum of digits of N = (1 + 3 + 9 + 7) = 20.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
First, we need to find the HCF of (2272 - 875) = 1397 and any 3-digit number.  
1397 is an odd number and not divisible by 2. 1397 is also not divisible by any prime less than 40. Let's try dividing 1397 by 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149 (all primes less than sqrt(1397)):
- 1397 / 101 = 13 remainder 84
- 1397 / 103 = 13 remainder 48
- 1397 / 107 = 13 remainder 28
- 1397 / 109 = 12 remainder 85
- 1397 / 113 = 12 remainder 41
- 1397 / 127 = 11 remainder 30
- 1397 / 131 = 10 remainder 107
- 1397 / 137 = 10 remainder 47
- 1397 / 139 = 10 remainder 27
- 1397 / 149 = 9 remainder 140

The only common divisor among them is 1397 - 107 = 1290.  
Checking 1290 with the given condition:  
2272 = 1290 * 1 + 982  
875 = 1290 * 0 + 875  

Both leave the same remainder, which is 982/1290 = 28/37.  

Now that we have the value of N, which is 1290, we need to calculate the sum of its digits.  
Sum of digits of 1290 = 1 + 2 + 9 + 0 = 12.

Response 8:
Firstly, finding the HCF of (2272, 875) = 17. Thus, the remainder is same when divided any factor of 17. The multiples of 17 which lie between 100 and 1000 are {102, 119, 136, ....986}. Sum of the digits of each number: 3 ≤ 2+7+2 ≤ 11; then obviously 2+7+2 = 11 in order to get the highest remainder with both the numbers.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 8
  C: 22
  D: 50
  E: 20
Response 0:
Let's denote the total work by W.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
From the problem statement, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, so we know that his cleaning rate is 1/12 of a yacht per hour. If Jack does two-thirds of the work, then the remaining portion of the work is (1-2/3) W = W/3. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, Jill's cleaning rate is 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 of a yacht per hour.

Let Jill take t hours to finish the remaining portion of the work. In that time, Jill cleans t * 1/240 of the yacht.

We know that combined, Jack and Jill complete the work, so:

[(2/3)W] + [(t/240)W] = W

Solve for t:

2W/3 + tW/240 = W 
2W/3 - W = -tW/240 
t = (-W/240) / (-1/20) = 50 

Therefore, it takes Jill 50 hours to finish the remaining work.
Response 1:
Let's assume that the whole work requires 12x hours.
Jack completes two-thirds of it, which means he finishes the remaining one-third of the work. So, the remaining portion of the work requires 4x hours to complete.
Now Jill's rate of work is 5% of what Jack can do, which means she can finish the work in 1/0.05 = 20 hours.
Therefore, Jill needs 20 - 4 = 16 more hours to finish the remaining work.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's find out the fraction of work left for Jill to do. Jack did 2/3 of the work and therefore 1/3 of the work is left.
Jack takes 12 hours to do the full work. To find the time taken by Jill, we need to know the fraction of work Jill can do in an hour.

We know that Jill's speed is 5% of Jack’s speed. So, Jack can do 100/5=20 times what Jill can do in one hour. This means Jill can do 1/20th of what Jack can do in one hour.

Time taken by Jill = Fraction of work left/Fraction of work done by her per hour
Time taken by Jill = (1/3) / (1/20)
Time taken by Jill = 6.66 hours

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is 7.
Action: Answer("None of the above") → Answer("B")
Response 3:
Let's assume that the total work that needs to be finished is denoted by "W", Then we have:
- Jack can finish the work in 12 hours, hence Jacks' rate = 1/12 of the work per hour.
- On that particular day, Jack finished 2/3 of the work, hence amount of work finished by Jack = (2/3)W
- The remaining work that needs to be done, hence remaining work = W - (2/3)W = (1/3)W
- Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, hence Jill's' rate = 5/100 x Jack's rate = 1/20 of the work per hour.

Now, Let's get the time Jill needs to finish the remaining work. We can start by using the following formula:

Total Time = Total Work / Rate

Jill needs to finish (1/3)W work.
Jill's rate= 1/20 of the work per hour
Therefore, Jill needs:
Total time = (1/3)W / (1/20) = 20/3 hours 

So the answer is: Answer("E") 20
Response 4:
Let the total work be LCM(12, t), where t is the time taken by Jill to clean the remaining one-third of the work. 

So, when Jack works alone, he can clean `(LCM(12, t))/12` fraction of the work in one hour and he completes 2/3 of the work. 

Therefore, the remaining fraction of the work is: 

`1 - (2/3) = 1/3`.

Using Jack's rate of work, the fraction of the work that he gets done in `t` hours is: 

`[(LCM(12, t))/12] × t`.

We know that Jill's rate of work is just 5% of what Jack can do. Hence, the fraction of the work that Jill can complete in one hour is:

`[(5/100) × (1/12)] = 1/240`.

Therefore, the fraction of the work she can complete in t hours is:

`(1/240) × t`. 

Since the work remaining is 1/3 of the total work, it follows that: 

`[(LCM(12, t))/12] × t + (1/240) × t = 1/3`

Simplifying and solving the above equation, we can get t as:

`t = 44`

Therefore, it would take Jill 44 hours to complete the remaining work.

Hence, Answer("C").
Response 5:
Let's first find Jack's cleaning rate. From the problem, we know that he can clean the whole yacht in 12 hours at a constant rate. Thus, his rate is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. 

Now, Jack completed 2/3 of the work, leaving 1/3 of the work to be done by Jill. Since we know Jack's cleaning rate, we can set up the equation: 

(1/12) * (2/3) = (1 - 2/3) * (1/3) * (1/20) * t

Solving for t, the time it takes for Jill to finish the remaining work: 

t = 8

Therefore, the answer is (B) 8
Response 6:
Let the time taken by Jill to complete the remaining work be x.   

Since Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, then the portion of the work done by Jack in the particular day is (1/12) x 8 = 2/3.   
Thus, the portion of the work remaining is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.   

Also, Jack's rate is (1 yacht)/(12 hours) = (1/12) yacht per hour.   
Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, which is (5/100) *  (1/12) = (1/240) yacht per hour.   

Since Jack completed 2/3 of the work in x = (2/3)*(8) = 16/3 hours, the portion of the work remaining, which Jill did, is:   
> (1/3) yacht = (1/12) * (16/3) +  (1/240) * x *  (1/3)  
> 1/3 = (4/9) + (x/7200)   
> (x/7200) = (1/3) - (4/9) = 1/9  
> x = 7200/9 ≈ 800

Therefore, Jill took approximately 800 hours to finish the remaining work.  

Action: Answer("None of the Above")  (None of the choices match the calculated result of approximately 800 hours, suggesting an error in the problem statement or answer choices.)
Response 7:
Let's first find how much time Jack took to clean 2/3 of the yacht:

Jack's rate = 1 yacht / 12 hours = 1/12 yachts per hour

2/3 of the yacht = (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 yachts

Time taken by Jack to clean 2/3 of the yacht = (2/3) / (1/12) = 8 hours

Now let's find how much more work is left:

Remaining work = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the yacht

We know that Jill's rate = Jack's rate * (5/100) = (1/12) * (5/100) = 1/240 yachts per hour

Let's assume the time taken by Jill to clean the remaining work = t hours

So, Jill finishes 1/3 of the yacht in t hours:

Jill's rate = 1/240 yachts per hour

1/3 of the yacht = (1/3) * 1 = 1 yachts

Time taken by Jill to clean 1/3 of the yacht = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours

Action: Answer("E") the answer is 80 hours.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let's say the work to be done by Jack alone is "W"
Therefore, the work Jack completes = 2/3 W
So, the remaining work = W - 2/3 W = 1/3 W
The rate of work of Jill is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, Jill can clean the yacht with a rate of 5/100*1/12W = 1/240W/hour
Let's say time taken by Jill to finish the remaining work is "t"
So, the work completed by Jill in the time "t" = 1/240W * t
As we know, the total work done by Jack and Jill is "W", we can write the equation as:
1/3W = 2/3W + 1/240W * t
On solving the above equation, we get t = 8

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###

Question: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 3
  C: 2
  D: 1
  E: 0
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")  

Explanation: Let's assume the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'. As per the given information, we can form the equations:
20c + 25b = 340 (in cents)
and b + c > 0 (because she brought at least one coin)

To solve for minimum number of copper coins, we need to assume the maximum number of brass coins first (because it gives more cents per coin). Let's assume b = 12, then we get:
20c + 25(12) = 340 => 20c = 70 => c = 3.5

This is not possible as number of coins should be a positive integer. Therefore, let's assume b = 11, then we get:
20c + 25(11) = 340 => 20c = 95 => c = 4.75

Again, not possible as the number of coins should be an integer. Therefore, let's assume b = 10, then we get:
20c + 25(10) = 340 => 20c = 90 => c = 4

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins brought by the diver is 4.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let's assume that the coin-diver brought 'c' number of copper coins and 'b' number of brass coins.
The total amount of money from copper coins = 20c cents
The total amount of money from brass coins = 25b cents
The total amount of money she got from both the copper and the brass coins after one dive = 340 cents i.e.
20c + 25b = 340
Also, we know that she gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. This means that the cost difference between copper and brass coins is 25 - 20 = 5 cents.
From the above equation we know that 20c + 25b = 340. This implies that the remainder (modulus) of 340 when divided by 20 is equal to the remainder of 5 * b when divided by 20. This is because the amount of money coming from copper coins can only be in multiples of 20. This means that the units digit of 5b should be either 0 or 5. 
The only choice that is valid is when b = 2 and c = 7 (Option B) because if b = 1, then c should be equal to (340 - 25b)/20 which is not an integer.
 
Action: Answer("B") - 3.
Response 5:
Let's assume that the coin diver brought 'x' number of copper coins, then the total money she received from copper coins is 20x cents. Likewise, let's assume that she brought 'y' number of brass coins, then the total money she received from brass coins is 25y cents.

As per the question, she received $3.40 in total, i.e. 340 cents. We can write this as an equation:

                            20x + 25y = 340  

To find the minimum number of copper coins, we need to check all the given options and see which one satisfies this equation. 

Let's start with option A: if she brought 4 copper coins, then the equation becomes: 

                            20(4) + 25y = 340 
                            80 + 25y = 340 
                            25y = 260 
                            y = 10.4   

So, option A does not satisfy the equation as the number of brass coins cannot be a decimal. We can similarly check for options B, C, D, and E. 

Checking for option B: 

                            20(3) + 25y = 340 
                            60 + 25y = 340 
                            25y = 280 
                            y = 11 

Option B satisfies the equation, which means the coin diver brought 3 copper coins. Therefore,

Question: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.
Choices:
  A: 368
  B: 377
  C: 288
  D: 997
  E: 112
Response 0:
Let the tens digit of the number be x, the ones digit be y, and the hundreds digit be z. Then the number can be expressed as 100z + 10x + y. From the problem statement, we have the following system of equations:

z + x + y = 17    (1)   (given)
z^2 + x^2 + y^2 = 109   (2)   (given)
100z + 10x + y - 495 = 100y + 10x + z   (3)   (given)

Simplifying equation (3), we get:

99z - 99y = 495
z - y = 5    (4)

Subtracting equation (4) from equation (1), we get:

2x = 12
x = 6

Substituting x = 6 into equation (1), we get:

z + y = 11    (5)

Squaring equation (5), we get:

z^2 + y^2 + 2zy = 121    (6)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (6), we get:

zy = 6       (7)

From equations (4) and (5), we have:

z = y + 5

Substituting z = y + 5 into equation (7), we get:

y(y + 5) = 6

Solving for y, we get:

y = 1 or y = -6

If y = 1, then z = 6 and the original number is 616. But this does not satisfy equation (2).

If y = -6, then z = -1 and the original number is -196. But this is not a three digit number.

Therefore, there is no solution to the problem.

Answer: None of the above (most likely answer)
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
To solve this question, we have to use some algebra.

Let's call the hundreds digit of the number "a", the tens digit "b", and the ones digit "c". We know the following:
a + b + c = 17   - equation 1
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109   - equation 2
100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a   - equation 3

From equation 3, we can simplify it to 99a - 99c = 495, which means a - c = 5   - equation 4

We can use equation 1 and equation 4 to solve for a and c in terms of b:
a = 6 + b
c = b - 1

Substituting these into equation 2 and simplifying, we get:
14b^2 - 60b + 41 = 0
Solving for b using the quadratic formula, we get:
b = 5/2 or b = 29/7

Since b has to be a whole number, we can ignore the 5/2 and use b = 29/7, which means a = 47/7 and c = 22/7. But since a, b, and c have to be integers, we can ignore this solution.

Therefore, the only possible value for b is 5, which means a = 11 and c = 4. Therefore, the original number is 114, and when we subtract 495 from it, we get 619, which is the same as 916 written in reverse.

Answer: Choice D, 997.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
We can start by trying to find all the possible three-digit numbers whose digits add up to 17. We observe that $17<2^2+2^2+2^2=12$, so all three digits must be less than or equal to three. We then guess and check all the possible sums of three digits that add up to 17. These are 8+8+1, 9+7+1, 9+6+2, 9+5+3, and 8+7+2. The squares of the first two sums are too small to be equal to 109, and for the other sums, any numbers whose digits consist of 3 distinct digits can't possibly satisfy the latter condition required by the problem. We are therefore left with 8, 7, and 2 as our digits. Using the constraint that if a three-digit number $abc$ lets us write $cba$ when 495 is subtracted from it, then $a-c=4$, we find that only 872 works. Therefore, the answer is 

$872+495=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 1367}$
Response 5:
Let's start by breaking down the question into smaller parts for easier understanding.
Let the three digit number be represented as (100a + 10b + c). 
From the given information, we know that:
a + b + c = 17         ---(equation 1)
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109  ---(equation 2)
Now, let's solve for the unknowns:
From equation 1, we know that c = 17 - a - b.
Substituting this value of c in equation 2, we get:
a^2 + b^2 + (17-a-b)^2 = 109
Simplifying the above expression, we get:
2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab - 34a - 34b + 208 = 0
Dividing throughout by 2, we get:
a^2 + b^2 + ab - 17a - 17b + 104 = 0  ---(equation 3)
Now, let's use the information given in the last part of the question:
If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.
Let (100p + 10q + r) be the reversed number.
So, we have:
100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100p + 10q + r
Substituting the value of c from equation 1,
100a + 10b + (17 - a - b) - 495 = 100p + 10q + (17 - p - q)   (as the digits are reversed)
98a - 90p + 8b - 10q = 475    ---(equation 4)
We can now solve for a and b using equations 3 and 4:
Using equation 3, we can rearrange the terms and get:
a^2 - 17a + b^2 - 17b + (ab + 104) = 0      ---(equation 5)
Now, using equation 4, we can express b in terms of a and substitute it in equation 5:
8a^2 - 312a + 3ab + 901 = 0
Solving for b gives:
b = (156 - 4a ± sqrt(1849 - 56a + 16a^2))/3   ---(equation 6)
Now, as a, b and c are digits, they should be integers between 0 and 9.
So, let's check the possible values of a using equation 6:
a = 3 => b = 7  and c = 7   (using equation 1)
a = 4 => no integer value of b satisfies the conditions
a = 5 => b = 1  and c = 11   (not possible as c should be a digit)
a = 6 => b = 4  and c = 7   (using equation 1)
So, the required number is 647.
Therefore, the answer is: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's let the hundreds digit be x, the tens digit be y, and the ones digit be z. Then we have:

x + y + z = 17 (equation 1)
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109 (equation 2)
100x + 10y + z - 495 = 100z + 10y + x (equation 3)

Simplifying equation 3, we get:

99x - 99z = 495
x - z = 5 (equation 4)

Now we can use equation 1 and equation 4 to solve for y:

x + y + z = 17
y = 17 - x - z
y = 12 - z (substituting x - 5 for z)

Substituting y = 12 - z into equation 2, we get:

x^2 + (12 - z)^2 + z^2 = 109
x^2 + 144 - 24z + 2z^2 = 109
x^2 + z^2 - 12z + 17 = 0 (equation 5)

We can use equation 4 and equation 5 to solve for x and z. Substituting x - 5 for z in equation 5, we get:

x^2 + (x - 5)^2 - 12(x - 5) + 17 = 0
2x^2 - 46x + 192 = 0
x^2 - 23x + 96 = 0
(x - 8)(x - 15) = 0

So x = 8 or x = 15. If x = 8, then z = 3 (from equation 4), and if x = 15, then z = 10. However, z must be a single digit, so we can only have x = 8 and z = 3. Substituting these values into equation 1, we get:

8 + y + 3 = 17
y = 6

So the number is 836. If we subtract 495 from this number, we get 341, which is the same as 143 written in reverse order. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")  (368)
Response 7:
We can start by guessing the middle digit could be 7 or 8 because we know that:
  * The sum of the digits is 17, so the last digit has to be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 8.
  * If the middle digit is 9, then the sum of the squares would be greater than 109.
  
Let's try first with the middle digit 7: 
  * If the last digit is 1, the first digit would be 9: 971 - 495 = 476, which is not the reverse of 971.
  * If the last digit is 5, the first digit would be 5: 571 - 495 = 76, which is not the reverse of 571.
  * If the last digit is 8, the first digit would be 2: 278 - 495 = -217, which is not a three-digit number with the same digits in reverse order.
  
Let's try now with the middle digit 8:
  * If the last digit is 0, the first digit would be 9: 908 - 495 = 413, which is not the reverse of 908.
  * If the last digit is 4, the first digit would be 6: 684 - 495 = 189, which is the reverse of 684.
  
Therefore, the answer is 684. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
We can start by guessing the middle digit of the three digit number as 7 or 8. If the middle digit is 8, then the hundreds digit and the unit digit should add up to 9, which is not possible. Hence the middle digit should be 7.  

From the question,   
Let's say the three digit number be 'abc'.  
a+b+c = 17  ... (1)  
a^2+b^2+c^2 = 109  ... (2)  

If we subtract 495 from the number abc, we shall get a number which is 'cba'  
abc - 495 = cba  
100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a  
99a - 99c = 495  
a - c = 5  ... (3)  

From equations (1) and (3), we get b = 6.  
From equation (3), we have a+c = 12.  

From equation (2),  
a^2+b^2+c^2 = 109  
a^2 + 36 + c^2 = 109  
a^2 + c^2 = 73  

The only values of a and c that satisfy this equation are (a, c) = (8, 4) or (4, 8).  
Thus, the three digit number is either 784 or 487.  

We can check which of these two numbers satisfies the given conditions:  
784 - 495 = 289, which is not the reverse of 784.  
487 - 495 = 992, which is the reverse of 487.  

So the answer is:  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let the number be xyz. 
Given sum of digits of a three digit number is 17, so x+y+z=17
Also, the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. Therefore x² + y² + z² = 109

But we know x+y+z=17, so 2(xy+yz+zx) = (x+y+z)²-x²-y²-z² = 2(17² - 109) = 140.
So, xy+yz+zx = 70.

Now, let the number be N, which would be equal to 100x+10y+z. 
We need to subtract 495 from the number and reverse it, which gives us the following equations:
        100x + 10y + z - 495 = 100z + 10y + x
               99x - 99z = 495 
                      x - z = 5

Now we have three equations:

x + y + z = 17
x² + y² + z² = 109
x - z = 5

From the first equation, we get z = 17 - x - y. Solving these three equations yields x=6, y=2 and z=9.

The number is xyz = 629.
After subtracting 495 from it and reversing it, we get the number 136.

Response 2:
To fit a sphere inside a cube, the diameter of the sphere should be equal to the edge of the cube. 

Volume of the cube = edge^3 

Volume of the sphere = (4/3)π r^3 

In this case, let's assume that the edge of the cube and the diameter of the sphere are both equal to "d"

So, Volume of the cube = d^3

Volume of the sphere = (4/3)π (d/2)^3 = (π/6) × d^3

Hence, Ratio of the volumes of the cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube = d^3 : (π/6) × d^3

Therefore, it simplifies to 6:π

Response 8:
First, let's assume the edge of the cube to be 'a' units. The volume of the cube is a^3 cubic units. 

And the diameter of the sphere, which fits inside the cube, is also 'a' units. 
For a sphere with diameter 'a' units, its radius is (a/2) units. And its volume is (4/3)πr^3.
     => (4/3)π(a/2)^3
     => (4/3)πa^3/8.

Now, the ratio of the volume of the cube to that of the sphere is:

    => (a^3)/[(4/3)πa^3/8]
    => 8a^3/4πa^3
    => 2: π
    
Therefore, the answer is: Answer("A").

Question: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
Choices:
  A: 50
  B: 70
  C: 75
  D: 100
  E: 125
Response 0:
First, we set up a chart to organize the information we have:

|              | Virus only | Worm only | Both | Total |
|--------------|------------|-----------|------|-------|
| Infected     |            |           |      |  250  |
| Not infected |            |           |      |       |

Let V be the number of files infected only by a virus and W be the number of files infected only by a worm. We can fill in some of the chart from the given information: 

|              | Virus only | Worm only | Both | Total |
|--------------|------------|-----------|------|-------|
| Infected     |     V      |     W     |  ?   |  250  |
| Not infected |    125-V   |           |      |       |

From the given information, we also know that:

- W = 2.5 (Both)
- V + W + Both = 250

We can use the second equation to solve for Both:

V + W + Both = 250
V + (2.5 * Both) + Both = 250
V + 3.5 * Both = 250
Both = (250 - V) / 3.5

Now we can fill in the remaining part of the chart:

|              | Virus only | Worm only | Both  | Total |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Infected     |     V     |    2.5B   |  B    |  250  |
| Not infected |    125-V  |     0     |  0.5B |       |

We also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means:

125 - V = 0.5B

We can use this equation and the expression for Both in terms of V to solve for V:

125 - V = 0.5B
125 - V = 0.5[(250 - V)/3.5]
125 - V = (125-0.2857V)
0.7143V = 0.5(250/3.5 - 125)
V = 35

Now we can solve for Both using the expression we derived earlier:

Both = (250 - V) / 3.5
Both = (250-35)/3.5
Both = 65

Finally, we can use the chart to find the number of files not infected by a worm:

Not infected = 125 - V - 0.5B
Not infected = 125 - 35 - 0.5(65)
Not infected = 70

Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Let C be the cost price of the article. Then, 20% profit means selling price (S) is 120% of the cost price. 

S = (120/100)C
360 = (120/100)C
C = (360 x 100) / 120
C = 300

Answer: B) 300.
Response 4:
Solution:
Let CP be the cost price of the article.
Profit % = 20%
Selling price = Rs. 360

We know that Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) + Profit (P)

=> SP = CP + P

=> CP = SP - P

where Profit P is calculated as P = (Profit % / 100) * CP

=> P = (20/100) * CP

=> P = (1/5) * CP

So, CP = SP - P

=> CP = 360 - 1/5 * CP

=> 6/5 * CP = 360

=> CP = 360 * 5/6

Therefore, CP = Rs. 300

Selling price = X + X(20/100) = 1.2X
According to the question, 1.2X = 360.
X = 360/1.2
X = 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

Question: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 30
  C: 45
  D: 60
  E: 75
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
We can start by setting up two equations:
Let x be the number of newspapers bought on Monday (or any other day besides Sunday) and y be the number of newspapers bought on Sunday. 
- Equation 1: y = 2x (since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday)
- Equation 2: 4y + 1(7x) = 210 (since the hotel pays $4 for each Sunday paper and $1 for each paper bought on Monday through Saturday, and the total cost per week is $210)

We can use Equation 1 to substitute y in terms of x in Equation 2:
4(2x) + 1(7x) = 210
Simplifying the left side:
8x + 7x = 210
15x = 210
x = 14

Therefore, the hotel buys 14 newspapers on Monday, which is choice A. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let x be the number of newspapers ordered on Monday, and y be the number ordered on Sunday.
The cost of x newspapers for Monday would be $1x
Since the number of newspapers ordered on Sunday is twice that of the other 6 days combined, then y = 2(1x + 1x + 1x + 1x + 1x + 1x)
Simplifying y, we get y = 12x
The total cost of papers is given as $210, so 4y + x = 210.
Substituting y = 12x in the above equation, we get 4 * 12x + x = 210.
Solving for x, we get x = 15.
Therefore, the hotel orders 15 papers on Monday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's work through this problem. Let the number of papers bought on each day from Monday to Saturday be x and let the number of papers bought on Sunday be 2x. 

The total cost of newspapers per week is:

6x * $1/paper (Monday to Saturday) + 2x * $4/paper (Sunday) = $210

Simplifying the expression, we have:

6x + 8x = $210
14x = $210
x = 15

So the hotel buys 15 papers on each day from Monday to Saturday, and 2x = 30 papers on Sunday. Therefore, the hotel buys a total of 6 * 15 + 30 = 120 papers per week. 

To find out how many papers the hotel buys on Monday, we need to subtract the papers bought on Sunday from the total papers bought on Monday to Saturday. So the hotel buys 120 - 30 = 90 papers from Monday to Saturday. 

Since the hotel buys the same number of papers on each of these days, the hotel buys 90/6 = 15 papers on Monday. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")  (15)
Response 4:
Let x be the number of newspapers ordered on each day of the week, except Sunday. Then the number of newspapers ordered on a Sunday is 2x. The total cost of 7 days' newspapers is (2x)(4) + 6(x)(1) = 8x + 6x = 14x dollars. Since the hotel pays $210 per week or 210/14=15 dollars per newspaper, we have 14x = 210/15 x 15=14x = 280, which yields x=20. Therefore, the hotel orders 20 newspapers on Mondays. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's try solving the problem step by step:
Let the number of newspapers ordered for the rest of the week be "x". 

The total cost of newspapers per week = (2*$4) + (x*($1)) 
                                    = 8 + x 

Also, we know the total cost per week for the newspapers to be $210. 

So, the equation becomes: 8 + x = 210 
                        x = 202 

Therefore, the number of newspapers the hotel orders on Monday is half the Sunday order. 
So, number of newspapers on Monday = (1/2)*2 = 1 multiply by 202/7 (rest of the week divided into 7 days) 
                                             = 29

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let's assume the hotel buys x newspapers on Sunday and y newspapers on Monday. 

From the given information, it can be translated into the equation as follows:
- 2x newspapers are bought on Sunday
- The cost of each Sunday edition is $4
- The cost of each Monday edition is $1
- The hotel pays $210 per week

2x(4) + y(1) * 6 = 210 (Multiply the Monday newspaper by six because it's purchased on six days other than Sunday in a week)
8x + 6y = 210 (Distribute the 2)
4x + 3y = 105 (Divide both sides by 2)

Also given that:
x = 2y (The hotel ordered twice as many papers on Sunday as the rest of the days of the week)

Now substitute the value of x in the above equation:
4(2y) + 3y = 105
11y = 105
y = 9.54

Rounding it to nearest integer gives y = 10. 

Therefore, the hotel buys 10 newspapers on Monday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's call the number of newspapers the hotel orders on Sunday, "S" and the number it orders on each of the other 6 days, "M". 

From the problem statement, we know the following:
- The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, so S = 2M.
- The hotel pays $4 per Sunday paper and $1 per paper on each of the other 6 days, so the total cost per week is 4S + 1(6M) = 210.

We can use the first equation to substitute 2M for S in the second equation and simplify:
4(2M) + 6M = 210
8M + 6M = 210
14M = 210
M = 15

So the hotel orders 15 newspapers on each of the other 6 days. 

Now we can use the first equation again to find the number of newspapers it orders on Sunday:
S = 2M = 2(15) = 30

Therefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
Choices:
  A: 144km
  B: 72 km
  C: 126km
  D: 84 km
  E: 48km
Response 0:
Let us consider that the distance from X to Y is D km. 
Let us also assume that they meet at a distance of x km away from Y on the first meeting.
Hence, they meet at (D - x) km away from X on the first meeting.
The time taken by Allen to first reach Y = x/54 as he traveled at 54kmph.
The time taken by Bob to first reach Y = x/78 as he traveled at 78 kmph.
Time taken by Allen to travel from Y to (D - x) = (D - x)/54
Time taken by Bob to travel from X to (D - x) = (D - x)/78.
Time taken by both Allen and Bob to travel to their respective locations and return back to the meeting point after passing would be the same.
Hence, (2x/54) + (2(D - x)/78) = (2D - 2x)/78 + (2x)/54
Simplifying the above equation, we can derive x = (9/26)*D
Now, we know that Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen in the same time.
Thus, (D - x) - x = 48 km => D - 2x = 48 km => D = 26x
Substituting the value of x in the above equation, we get D = 936/13 = 72 km approximately.
Thus, the answer is Action: Answer("B") 72 km.
Response 1:
Let's first consider the distance between X and Y as "d". 
We know that time taken by Allen and Bob to meet for the first time = d/(54+78) = d/132
Since they both meet for the second time when they both complete half of their journey, we can say that Allen covers d/2 distance and Bob covers (d/2+48) distance.
Now, we can set up a time equation:
time taken by Allen to cover d/2 distance + time taken by Bob to cover (d/2+48) distance = d/132
d/2*54 + (d/2 + 48)*78 = d/132
On solving the above equation, we get d = 126 km.
Therefore, the answer is "C: 126km".
Response 2:
Let us assume,
Distance between X and Y = D
Time at which they meet for the first time = t
Let T be the time taken for them to meet for the second time.
So, from the given information,
Allen will cover D/2 km in time t, thus covered distance = 54t
Bob will cover D/2 + 48 km in time t, thus covered distance = 78t
Opposite to each other speed = 54 + 78 
On meeting, their covered distance = distance between them
54t + 78t = D …..(1)
54t + 78t - 48 km = D ……(2) (Given ; By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen)
solving equation 1 and 2 for D, We get,
D = 126 km
Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 126km.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C") - 126km
Response 5:
Let's call the distance between X and Y as d. 
Let's assume that the distance travelled by Allen from X to Y is x. 

Now, we know that both start at the same time and they meet twice. 
The distance travelled by Allen in the first meeting is x km and the distance travelled by Bob in the first meeting is d-x km. 

The time taken by both will be the same. 

So, time taken by Allen: x/54 + (d-x)/54  = [x+(d-x)]/54 = d/54
Time taken by Bob: (d-x)/78 + x/78 = d/78

Given that "By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen.", we can write:

distance covered by Bob in the second meeting - distance covered by Allen in the second meeting = 48
[(d-x) + x ] - x = 48 km
d-x= 48 km

Substituting this value in the time equation, we get:

d/54 = 2d/78 - 48/78

Solving the above equation, we get d=126 km.

Therefore, Choice C: 126 km is the answer.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
First we need to calculate the ratio of their speeds. Let the distance between X and Y be d.

Let the time until both meet for the first time be t. Let the time between first and second meeting be x. 

Since they both started at the same time, we can say that: 

D1 = 54t    --- Distance covered by Allen before first meeting, when going from X to Y
D2 = 78t    --- Distance covered by Bob before first meeting, when going from Y to X

Both of them meet somewhere between X and Y. Therefore, we can say that Allen had covered a distance of x/2 kilometers towards Y. Similarly, Bob had covered a distance of x/2 kilometers towards X.

So the distance covered by Allen from Y to X till second meeting:
D3 = 54(x/2) = 27x        --- Distance covered by Allen after meeting Bob for the first time

Similarly, the distance covered by Bob from X to Y till second meeting:
D4 = 78(x/2) = 39x        --- Distance covered by Bob after meeting Allen for the first time

We also know that Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen by second meeting. From these two equations, we have:
39x - 27x = 48
12x = 48
x = 4 hours. 

Therefore, Allen covered 54 * (4/2) = 108 km from Y to X till second meeting.
Similarly, Bob covered 78 * (4/2) = 156 km from X to Y till second meeting. 

Total distance between X and Y:
d = 2(108) + 2(156) = 528 km

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 8:
First, we can calculate the ratio of time taken by Allen and Bob to meet each other at the first time. Let's assume the distance between X and Y be d.
Let speed of Allen = a and speed of Bob = b
Using the relative speed concept, their relative speed = (a+b) kmph.
Distance between X and Y = d km
Time taken for them to meet for the first time is d/(a+b) hours.
Hence, ratio of time taken by Allen : Bob = (d/(a+b))/(d/(a+b)) = 1:1
The distance traveled by Allen and Bob before they meet for first time = (a+b) * d/(a+b) = d km.
After they meet for the first time, Allen has traveled half the distance i.e. d/2 km.
Now, Bob has to cover (d/2+48)km when he meets Allen for the second time.
Now, let's calculate the time taken for them to meet for second time:
Distance traveled by Allen before meeting Bob for the second time = d/2 km
Distance traveled by Bob before meeting Allen for the second time = d/2 + 48 km
Time taken for Allen to cover the distance = d/2/(54 kmph)
Time taken for Bob to cover the distance = (d/2 + 48)/(78 kmph)
But, they travel for the same amount of time to meet each other. Hence,
d/2 * (1/54) = (d/2 + 48) * (1/78)
Solving this equation will get us d = 126
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 9:
First, we need to solve for the time taken by both Allen and Bob to meet each other for the first time. Let distance between X and Y be d.

Let's say they meet at point Z, where AZ = x and ZY = d - x.

Time taken by Allen to reach Z = x / 54
Time taken by Bob to reach Z = (d - x) / 78

Since they started at the same time, the time taken by Allen = the time taken by Bob.

x / 54 = (d - x) / 78
78x = 54d - 54x
132x = 54d
22x = 9d

After they meet for the first time, Allen and Bob are equidistant from points X and Y - in other words, they are both at a point that is x distance away from X and d - x distance away from Y. This means they will meet for the second time at the point exactly opposite to the point where they first met - that is, x distance away from Y and d - x distance away from X.

Let's call this point Z'. At this point, Allen and Bob will have travelled a total distance of:
(x + d - x) + (d - x) + (x + d - x) = 2d

Bob travels 48 km more than Allen before they meet for the second time:
Distance travelled by Bob = distance travelled by Allen + 48
(2 * (d - x)) + (d - x)/2 = (2 * x) + (d - x)/2 + 48
d - x = 48
x = d - 48

Substituting this value of x back into our equation from earlier, we get:
22x = 9d
22(d - 48) = 9d
d = 144/13

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
Response 0:
We can solve this question using the formula:   
Distance = Speed × Time  

Let's say the distance travelled by the jeep is "D" km.  
During the forward journey, the jeep's speed is denoted as "S" km/h.  
During the return journey, the jeep's speed is "S+12" km/h.  

We know the jeep took 6 hours during the forward journey, so:  
D = S × 6  

We know the jeep took 4 hours during the return journey, so:  
D = (S+12) × 4  

We can use these equations to solve for the value of D:  
D = 6S  
D = 4(S+12)  
Equating these equations, we get:  
6S = 4(S+12)  
Solving for S, we get:  
S = 24  

Now, we can use either equation to find the value of D:  
D = 6S = 6 × 24 = 144km  

Therefore, the answer is:  

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's assume the distance travelled by the Jeep is "D."
Let's also assume the speed of the Jeep on its forward journey is "S" km/hr.
According to the problem, the speed on the return journey is 12 km/hr more than the speed of the forward journey. Therefore, the speed on the return journey is equal to "S + 12" km/hr.
Using the formula "Speed = Distance/Time," we can set up two equations as follows:  
- Forward journey: D/S = 6    (since it takes 6 hours in the forward journey)
- Return journey: D/(S+12) = 4  (since it takes 4 hours in the return journey)

Multiplying the first equation by "S" and the second equation by "(S+12)," we get:
- Forward journey: D = 6S
- Return journey: D = 4(S+12)

Equating the above two equations, we get:
6S = 4(S+12)
Solving for S, we get: S = 18km/hr

Substituting S into the equation D = 6S, we get: D = 6(18) = 108km

Therefore, the Jeep travelled a distance of 108 km. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above") [since the correct answer (108km) is not provided in the choices]
Response 3:
We can use the formula:

distance = speed × time

Let's assume that the distance traveled by the jeep is "d" and its speed during the forward journey is "s". 

According to the problem, it took 6 hours to travel the distance "d" at a speed of "s". So:

d = s × 6

During the return journey, the jeep increased its speed to "s + 12" km/hr and traveled the same distance "d" in 4 hours. So:

d = (s + 12) × 4

We can now solve for "d" by equating the two expressions for "d":

s × 6 = (s + 12) × 4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6s = 4s + 48

2s = 48

s = 24 km/hr

Now we can substitute the value of "s" in any of the two expressions for "d" to get the distance "d":

d = s × 6 = 24 × 6 = 144 km

So the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Solution:
Let's assume that the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is 'x' km/hr.
According to the question;
During forward journey time taken = 6 hours
During return journey the time taken = 4 hours and speed = x+12 km/hr
Distance = Speed x Time

Distance covered in the forward journey --> (x km/hr x 6 hrs) = 6x km
Distance covered in the return journey -->  (x+12 km/hr x 4 hrs) = 4(x+12) km
Total distance travelled in round trip = (6x + 4(x+12)) km = 10x + 48 km
Hence, the distance travelled by the jeep is 10x + 48 km.

Now, let's substitute the values provided in the question to get the value of 'x'.
We know that the distance covered both sides should be equal
Hence, 6x =  4(x+12)
Simplifying this, we get
x = 24 km/hr

Substituting in Distance formula,
Total distance travelled in round trip --> 10x + 48 = 10(24) + 48 = 240 + 48 = 288 km.

Answer: Answer("D") i.e. 228km.
Response 5:
Solution: 

Let the distance be 'd' km.
Let the speed during the forward journey be 's' km/hr.
During the return journey, the speed of the jeep was (s + 12) km/hr.

Using the formula: distance = speed x time,

we have:
For the forward journey: d = s x 6 ------(1)
For the return journey: d = (s + 12) x 4 -----(2)

Solving for s in equation (1), we get:
s = d/6

Substituting s = d/6 in equation (2), we get:
d = (d/6 + 12) x 4
d = d/3 + 48
2d/3 = 48
d = (3 x 48)/2
d = 72 x 3
d = 216 km

Hence, the jeep travelled a distance of 216 km.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
We can start the problem by using the formula Distance = Speed * Time.
Let's assume that the speed of the jeep on the forward journey is x km/hr.
On the return journey, the speed of the jeep is (x + 12) km/hr.

The distance travelled by the jeep on the forward journey is given by D = S1 * T1 = x * 6 km.
The distance travelled on the return journey is given by D = S2 * T2 = (x + 12) * 4 km.

Since the distances are the same, we can equate the two equations to get:
x * 6 = (x + 12) * 4
Simplifying the equation, we get:
6x = 4x + 48
2x = 48
x = 24

Now we can calculate the distance by substituting x = 24 in any of the two equations above:
D = x * 6 = 24 * 6 = 144 km

Therefore, the jeep travelled 144 kilometers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let the distance travelled by the jeep be "d" and its speed be "s". 

In the forward journey, 

distance = speed x time 

d = s x 6 

In the return journey, 

distance = speed x time 

d = (s + 12) x 4 

Equating the two expressions for "d", we get: 

s x 6 = (s + 12) x 4 

Solving for "s", we get: 

s = 36 

Substituting s = 36 in either of the above expressions for "d", we get: 

d = s x 6 = 36 x 6 = 216km 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
First, we can let x be the speed of the jeep during the forward journey. Then, the distance travelled is equal to speed multiplied by time. So, the distance travelled during the forward journey is 6x. For the return trip, the speed is x+12km/hr and time is 4 hours, making the distance travelled 4(x+12).

Since the forward and return trips cover the same distance, we can set the two distances equal to each other: 6x = 4(x+12).
Simplifying the equation, we get:
6x = 4x+48
2x = 48
x = 24

Therefore, the speed of the jeep during the forward journey is 24km/hr. Using the distance formula, the distance travelled during the forward journey is:

distance = speed * time
distance = 24km/hr * 6 hours
distance = 144km

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 28
  C: 30
  D: 53
  E: 59
Response 0:
We can start solving the problem by assuming that the number of water lilies on day one is 64. Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, we can write an exponential function to model the situation:

f(t) = 64 x 2^(t/2)

where t is the time in days.

We know that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if there is only one water lily initially. This means that the equation

f(60) = 1

is true. We can use this equation to solve for the value of the constant C:

64 x 2^(60/2) = 64 x 2^30 = C x 1

C = 64 x 2^30

Now we can use this value of C to answer the question:

f(t) = 64 x 2^(t/2) = C

64 x 2^(t/2) = 64 x 2^30

2^(t/2) = 2^30

t/2 = 30

t = 60

Therefore, it would take 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if initially there were 64 water lilies. 

Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let's use exponential growth formula for the number of water lilies `N` on the lake after `d` days, given that the initial number is `n`, and each lily doubles every two days, then we have:

`N = n * (2^(d/2))`

We want to find the number of days `d` needed for the number of lilies to cover the lake, which is equal to the number of lilies `N` on the last day being equal to the area of the lake `A`, which is also the initial number of lilies `n`. Therefore, we can write:

`A = N = n * (2^(d/2))`

Substituting `A = n = 64`, we get:

`64 = 64 * (2^(d/2))`

Simplifying the expression, we obtain:

`1 = 2^(d/2 - 6)`

Taking the logarithm of both sides (with base 2), we get:

`log2(1) = (d/2 - 6) * log2(2)`

`0 = d/2 - 6`

`d = 12`

So the lake will be fully covered with lilies after `12` * `2` = `24` days.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 2:
We can use exponential growth formula to solve this problem: 

$$ P = P_0 2^{\frac{t}{k}} $$

where: 

- $P$ is the final population
- $P_0$ is the initial population
- $t$ is the time it takes for the population to grow
- $k$ is the time it takes for population to double.

Let's first find out how many times the population should double to reach from 1 to 2^x if doubling occurs every two days. 

$$2^x = \frac{P}{P_0} = P$$
$$2^x = 2^{\frac{t}{k}}$$
$$x = \frac{t}{k}$$

If we set $x=1$, we can find $t$, which is the time it takes for population to double. 

$$1 = \frac{t}{2}$$
$$t = 2$$

Now we know that population doubles every 2 days. If we start with 64 water lilies, the population will be $2^6 = 64$ after 6 doubling periods. 

Let $T$ be the time it takes for the lake to be fully covered. We can use the same formula to find $T$:

$$2^6 = 2^{\frac{T}{2}}$$

Solving for $T$ yields:

$$\frac{T}{2} = 6 \times 2$$
$$T = 24$$

Thus, the lake will be fully covered in $6 \times 2 + 24 = 36$ days.

Answer: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Let's first find out the rate of increase in the number of lilies. If the number of lilies doubles every two days and there's exactly one lily on day 0, then on day 2, there will be 2 lilies, on day 4 there will be 4 lilies, on day 6 there will be 8 lilies, and so on. We can see that the number of lilies is given by the formula $N=2^{d/2}$, where $d$ is the number of days elapsed. 

If initially, there are 64 water lilies on the lake, then we have $64=2^{d/2}$, which implies $d=6\times 2=12$ days to grow from 1 to 64 lilies. 

Now, if the number of lilies at $d$ days is $2^{d/2}$, and we know that on day 12 there are 64 lilies, we can find the value of $d$ that will give us $2^{d/2}=64\cdot2^{48}$. 

We have $2^{d/2}=64\cdot2^{48}$, which implies $2^{d/2-6}=2^{48}$. Thus, $d/2-6=48$, which gives $d=102$.

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("D"), 53 days.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let x be number of days for the lake to be fully covered with 64 lilies.  
The number of lilies will double in (x/2) days and can be represented as:  
64 * 2^((x/2)/(60/2)) = 2^(x/60)  
Simplify the equation:  
2^(6/60) * 2^(x/60) = 2^(x/60)  
2^(6/60) = 1.122  
64 * 1.122^x = 2^(x/60)  

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's call the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies as "d".
For the first case (one water lily), we know that d = 60.
For the second case (64 water lilies), we can use the formula: N = N0 * 2^(t/k), where N is the final number of water lilies, N0 is the initial number, t is the time elapsed, and k is the time it takes for the number of water lilies to double.
Thus, using the values given: 2^6 = 64, so the initial amount of time it took for the lake to be fully covered was 6 days less than 60 (since the amount of lilies doubled multiple times before taking the full 60 days to cover the lake). Therefore, it took 54 days for the 64 lilies to fully cover the lake.
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let's first calculate the number of doublings that occurred in the lake to go from 1 to 64 water lilies: 

64 = 2^6, so 6 doublings happened. 

Now, the lake will be fully covered when there are 2^6 = 64 doublings. 

Since we know that the number of doublings doubles every 2 days, the number of days required is: 

6 doublings * 2 days/doubling = 12 days. 

Therefore, Answer("None of the above") as the correct answer is 12 days.
Response 8:
First, let's find the growth factor of the water lilies. We know that the amount of water lilies doubles every two days, so:

Day 2: 1 * 2 = 2
Day 4: 2 * 2 = 4
Day 6: 4 * 2 = 8
And so on.

This means that on day n, the number of water lilies will be 2^(n/2).

So, if there were 64 water lilies initially, then we can find the number of days it takes to cover the lake by solving:

2^(n/2) = 64 * 2^30

Simplifying, we get:

2^(n/2) = 2^36

n/2 = 36

n = 72

Therefore, it would take 72 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies. Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Let N be the number of days required for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, if initially there was one lily.
After 60 days, the number of lilies on the lake = 1 * 2^(60/N)
We are given that there are 64 lilies initially. Therefore, 64 * 2^(60/N) = 2^6 * 2^(60/N) = 2^(60+N/N).
Thus, 2^(60+N/N) = 2^6 * 2^(60/N).
Simplifying, we get 2^N = 2^6, which implies N = 6.
So the lake was fully covered with lilies in 6 * 60 = 360 days.

  A: 40.8
  B: 41.6
  C: 42.2
  D: 43.5
  E: 44.8
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's solve the problem using basic math.
Let's suppose the weight of the heavy duty truck is "x".
According to the problem:
Average weight of the group of vehicles with 10 vehicles = 12.2
Sum of weights of 10 vehicles = 10*12.2 = 122
Average weight of the group of vehicles with 11 vehicles = 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8
Sum of weights of 11 vehicles = 11*14.8 = 162.8
So, the weight of the heavy duty truck can be calculated as:
x + 122 = 162.8
x = 162.8 - 122 = 40.8

Therefore, the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck is 40.8 tons, which is represented by choice A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let x be the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck.
The sum of the weights of the original 10 vehicles is 10 x 12.2 = 122 tons.
After adding the heavy duty truck, the sum of the weights of the 11 vehicles is (10 x 12.2) + x = 10 x 14.8.
Therefore, x = (10 x 14.8) - 122.
Action: Answer("D") - 43.5.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
We can start by using the formula for the arithmetic mean: 

average = (sum of all weights) / (number of vehicles)

Let's use "x" to represent the weight of the new truck. 

Before the new truck: 
average = 12.2 
sum of all weights = 12.2 * 10 = 122 

After the new truck: 
average = 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 
sum of all weights = 14.8 * 11 = 162.8 

We can set up an equation: 

162.8 = 122 + x 

Solving for x: 

x = 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 

Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 40.8 tons.

  E: 50/7
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
First, we need to find the amount of sand and clay in the original mixture:
- Sand: 30% of 10kg = 3kg
- Clay: 70% of 10kg = 7kg

Let's assume that we need to remove x kg of the original mixture and replace it with pure sand.
After the replacement, we will have:
- Sand: 3kg + x kg
- Clay: 7kg - x kg

Since we want the mixture to contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we have:
3kg + x kg = 7kg - x kg

Solving for x, we get:
x = 2kg

So we need to remove 2kg of the original mixture and replace it with pure sand.
The total amount of mixture that remains after the replacement is 10kg - 2kg = 8kg.

The amount of sand in the final mixture is:
(3kg + 2kg) / 8kg = 5/8 of the mixture

The amount of clay in the final mixture is:
(7kg - 2kg) / 8kg = 5/8 of the mixture

Therefore, the answer is:

Response 3:
The formula for calculating the total number of possible outcomes is:
(number of options for 1st position) × (number of options for 2nd position) × (number of options for 3rd position) × (number of options for 4th position)

There are 26 letters in the English alphabet. Therefore, the number of possible options for the 1st and 2nd position is 26 x 26= 676.
There are 10 digits (0-9) to choose from for the 3rd and 4th position. Therefore, the number of possible options for the 3rd and 4th position is 10 x 10= 100.

The total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is the product of the above, i.e.,
676 x 100 = 67600

So, we need 2 distinct letters for the first two positions.

Question: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre?
Choices:
  A: 3400
  B: 1700
  C: 3440
  D: Cannot be determined
  E: None of these
Response 0:
Let the length and breadth of rectangular plot be L and B respectively.
We know that,
2(L+B) = Perimeter of a rectangle
2(L+B) = 340 m 
L+B = 170 m
Also,
Boundary of rectangular plot = 1 metre
Therefore,
Area of garden = Area of plot – Area of garden with 1 metre – broad boundary
Area of garden = L × B – (L-2) × (B-2) 
Area of garden = L × B – LB + 2L + 2B – 4
Area of garden = 2L + 2B – 4
Area of garden = 2(L+B) - 4
Area of garden = 2 (170) – 4
Area of garden = 336 square metres
Therefore,
Cost of gardening = Area of the garden × Rate per square metre
Cost of gardening = 336 × 10
Cost of gardening = 3360

Response 9:
To determine the cost of gardening the 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot, we need to find out the area of ​​the rectangular plot, and then add the area of ​​the boundary i.e. 1 meter from all sides.

Let's suppose the length of the rectangular plot is 'l' and width is 'w':

Perimeter of the plot = 2(l+w) = 340 (given)

l+w = 170    ----------------------- equation 1

We are not given the actual length and width of the plot, so we might not be able to calculate the exact area of rectangular plot.

However, we know that the area of the garden is equal to the area of rectangular plot + the area of the 1-meter boundary. The width of the boundary is 1 meter, so we have to add 2 meters to both length and width to get the total dimensions. So, the new length will be (l + 2) and the new width will be (w + 2).

Area of garden = (l + 2) x (w + 2)

Cost of gardening per square metre = Rs. 10

Total cost of gardening = Area of garden x Cost per sq. metre

Total cost of gardening = (l + 2) x (w + 2) x 10

Total cost of gardening = (lw + 2l + 2w + 4) x 10 (using distributive property of multiplication)

Total cost of gardening = 10lw + 20l + 20w + 40

We can replace (l + w) by 170 (from equation 1)

Total cost of gardening = 10lw + 20(170 - w) + 20w + 40

Total cost of gardening = 10lw + 3400

We don't have the values of length and width, so we cannot determine the correct value of total cost of gardening.

Question: Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
Choices:
  A: 50 %
  B: 60 %
  C: 55 %
  D: 70 %
  E: 58%
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A") 

The cost price of 1 kg of oranges = 450/90 = Rs. 5
The selling price of 1 kg of oranges = Rs. 7.5
The profit made on 1 kg of oranges = selling price - cost price = 7.5 - 5 = Rs. 2.5
The percentage gain = (profit/cost price) x 100%
                            = (2.5/5) x 100%
                            = 50% so the answer is 50%
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")  

Explanation:
The cost price of 1kg orange = 450/90 = 5
The selling price of 1kg orange = 7.50
The profit earned on 1kg orange = Selling price - Cost price = 7.50 - 5 = 2.50
The profit percentage = Profit/Cost Price × 100 = (2.5/5) × 100 = 50%
Therefore, the merchant's percentage gain is twice the percentage of profit which is 50% × 2 = *100%. The overall percentage gain is 100% + 50% = 150%.  
The closest answer is 55%, making it the correct answer.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A") 

Explanation: 

Total selling price = Rs. 7.50 x 90 = Rs. 675 

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = Rs. (675 - 450) = Rs. 225

Percentage Gain = (Profit / Cost Price) × 100 = (225 / 450) × 100 = 50%.

Explanation: 
The cost price of 1 kg of orange = 450/90 
                                     = 5  
Selling price of 1 kg of orange = Rs. 7.50 
Profit per 1 kg of orange = Selling price per 1 kg of orange - Cost price per 1 kg of orange = 7.50 - 5 = 2.50 
Profit percentage = Profit per 1 kg of orange/Cost price per 1 kg of orange x 100 = (2.50/5) x 100 = 50%
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")  

Explanation: 
Cost of 1 kg of Oranges = 450 / 90 = Rs. 5
Selling price of 1 kg of Oranges = Rs. 7.50
Profit made on 1 kg of Orange = Selling Price - Cost Price = Rs. (7.50 - 5) = Rs. 2.50
Profit made on 90 kg of oranges = 2.50 x 90 = Rs. 225

Response 1:

Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's denote Joe's age as J, his sister's age as S, and his father's age as F. 

From the first given condition, we have J + S + F = 100.

Let x be the number of years until Joe is as old as his father. At that point, we have:
J + x = F + x   ->  J = F
S + x = 2(S)    ->  x = S

Substituting S for x in the second equation, we get:
J + S = 2(F - S)   ->   J = F - 3S

Now we have a system of three equations:
J + S + F = 100
J = F
J = F - 3S

Substituting J = F into the third equation, we get:
F = F - 3S  ->  S = F/3

Substituting S = F/3 into the second equation, we get:
J = 2F/3

Substituting J = F and S = F/3 into the first equation, we get:
F + F/3 + F = 100  ->  F = 45

Therefore, the father's age is 45. Answer("A")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To solve this problem, we can use substitution. We can represent Joe's age as "J," his sister's age as "S," and his father's age as "F." From the first piece of information, we know that:

J + S + F = 100

We also know that "when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now." Let's call the age at which this happens "x." Then we have:

J + x = F + x (when Joe is as old as his father)
S + x = 2S (Joe's sister will be twice as old as now)

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

x = S

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

J + S + F = 100
J + x + F = 100
J + S + F = J + S + F
(J + x) + S + F = J + 2S + F
F + S = 3S

So we know that F + S = 3S. We also know from the third piece of information that "when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father." Let's call the age at which Joe is as old as his father "y." Then we have:

J + y = F + y (when Joe is as old as his father)
S + F - S = 2(S - F + S) (when Joe is as old as his father and his sister is as old as his father was when his sister was as old as Joe is now)
Solve the second equation for F-S as follows: 

2(S - F + S) = F - S
3S - F = F - S
2F = 4S
F = 2S

Now we can substitute F = 2S into F + S = 3S to solve for S:

F + S = 3S
2S + S = 3S
S = 30

Finally, we can substitute S = 30 into F = 2S to solve for F:

F = 2S
F = 2(30)
F = 60

Therefore, Joe's father's age is 60.

Christopher gave 2$ to Jonathan x times, so he gave a total of 2x$ to Jonathan. 

Jonathan gave 3$ to Christopher (20-x) times, so he gave a total of 3(20-x)$ to Christopher. 

As per the question, none of them won or lost any amount. 

Therefore, 2x$ = 3(20-x)$

Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let the distance from A to B be x miles.
Let the time it took Kevin to get from A to B be t hours.
Since his speed was 70 mph, we know that: 
x = 70t

Let the time it took Kevin to get from B to A be t' hours. 
Since his speed was 90 mph, we know that:
x = 90t'

Now we also know that Kevin was 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before reaching A.
This means, after traveling t-3 hours, he covered 70 miles from A and was at (x-70) miles away from B.
During the remaining 3 hours of the trip, he covered another (90*3)=270 miles, and finally reached A.
Overall, Kevin covered (x+70+270) miles in (t+t') hours.
However, we know that he traveled for (t-3) hours before that, so we can also write:
x + 70 + (90*3) = (t+t')(70+90)
x + 70 + 270 = (t+t')(160)
x = 160(t+t') - 340

Now we need to eliminate t' and substitute it with t using our previous equations.
t' = x/90
x = 160(t + (x/90)) - 340
x = 160t + (16/9)x - 340

Solving for x:
(7/9)x = 500
x = (9/7)*500
x = 642.86

Therefore, the distance between A and B is approximately 642.86 miles.

So, n(x+60) = 624000.....(2)

Dividing equation (2) by equation (1), we get:
(x+60)/x = 1.04
x+60 = 1.04x
0.04x = 60
x = 1500

Substituting the value of x in equation (1), we get:
nx = 600000
n = 600000/x
n = 600000/1500
n = 400

Therefore, the number of employees in that organization is 400.

Answer: Option C (400)
Response 3:
Let the number of employees be x.
Then, 
total contribution = Rs. 6 lakh 
contribution per employee = Rs. 6 lakh/x

If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, then the new contribution per employee will be (6 lakh + 24,000)/x = Rs. 6,240/x
So, according to the given condition,
6 lakh/x + 60 = 6240/x

Solving this equation, we get
x = 400

Therefore, the number of employees in that organization is 400.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Let the share of each nephew be x. 

Then the share of each son is 5x 
And the share of each daughter is 4 * (share of each nephew) = 4x 

The total number of people who received a share = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. 

Total share = 8600 

So, (5 * 5x) + (4 * 4x) + (2 * x) = 8600 

Solving the above equation, we get x = 100 

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4 * 100 = Rs 400 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let us first calculate the amount received by all the nephews.
Let 'x' be the amount received by each nephew.
Then, each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x.

The total number of recipients is:
5 + 4 + 2 = 11

The total amount divided is Rs 8600.

We can write this information as follows:

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600

Simplifying this equation, we get:

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200

Hence, each nephew receives Rs 200.

Thus, each daughter receives Rs (4 * 200) = Rs 800.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let the amount received each nephew is x. 

Amount received by each son = 5x  
Amount received by each daughter = 4(5x) = 20x  
Total number of children = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11  

Total amount = Rs 8600  

So,  
5(5x) + 4(20x) + 2(x) = 8600  
25x + 80x + 2x = 8600  
107x = 8600  
x = 80  

Amount received by each daughter = 20x = 20 * 80 = Rs 1600  

Therefore, 

Action: Answer("None of the above") 

The correct answer is not in the given choices.
Response 3:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each son is Rs 5x and the share of each daughter is Rs 20x.
Using the concept of the division of money in a ratio, we can write the following equation:
5s + 4d + 2n = 8600,
where s, d, and n are the respective number of sons, daughters, and nephews.
Substituting the values in the equation, we get:
5(5x) + 4(20x) + 2(x) = 8600
25x + 80x + 2x = 8600
107x = 8600
x = 80
Therefore, each daughter will receive 20x = Rs 1600.
Hence, the answer is Answer("None of the above").
Response 4:
Let each nephew receive x.
Each daughter will receive 4x.
Each son will receive 5x.

We can set up the following equation to solve for x:

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2x = 8600
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let the share of each nephew be x, then each daughter will receive 4x and each son will receive 5x. So the total number of shares = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.
Given, 
5x + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
17x = 8600/3
x = 500
Hence, each daughter's share = 4 * 500 = Rs 2000.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Let X be the amount each nephew receives. 

Each daughter receives 4 times the amount of nephew, so they receive 4X each. 

Each son receives 5 times the amount of nephew, so they receive 5X each. 

The total number of recipients is 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11. 

The total amount is Rs 8600.

Total amount = (Amount per nephew * number of nephews) + (Amount per daughter * number of daughters) + (Amount per son * number of sons)
Rs 8600 = (X*2) + (4X*4) + (5X*5)
Rs 8600 = 2X + 16X + 25X
Rs 8600 = 43X
X = Rs 200 

Therefore, each daughter receives 4X = 4*Rs 200 = Rs 800
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let the amount each nephew gets be x.

Then, each daughter gets 4x and each son gets 5x.

Total number of family members = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

So, sum of all the amounts = 11x.

From the question, we know that the total sum is Rs 8600.

Therefore, 11x = 8600

x = 8600/11

x = 782.81

Each daughter gets 4 times this amount i.e. Rs 313.25.

Action: Answer("None of the above") [The amount each daughter receives is Rs 313.25 which is not an option in the choices given.]
Response 9:
Let's first consider the nephew's share. Let the amount that each nephew receives be "x". Then, each daughter receives 4 times as much as each nephew, which is 4x. Similarly, each son receives 5 times as much as each nephew, which is 5x.

The total amount is divided among:
- 5 sons, so they receive 5x each, for a total of 5 * 5x = 25x
- 4 daughters, so they receive 4 * 4x = 16x in total
- 2 nephews, so they receive 2x in total

The sum of these amounts equals the total amount divided:
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600

Simplifying:
43x = 8600
x = 200

So each daughter receives 4 times as much as each nephew, which is 4x = 4 * 200 = Rs 800

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 2520
  C: 1728
  D: 1656
  E: None
Response 0:
First, we can set up the equation: 

7/18x - 7/8x = 770

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the denominators. We can do this by finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 18 and 8, which is 72. So, we can multiply both sides by 72 to get:

4x - 9x = 55440

Simplifying, we get:

-5x = 55440

x = -11088

But we need to find the absolute value of x, so:

|x| = |-11088| = 11088

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D") 1656
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let's suppose that the actual number is "x". 

If the student needs to find 7/8 of "x", he finds (7/18) * x + 770 instead. 

To solve for "x", we can set up the following equation and solve it:

(7/8) * x - (7/18) * x = 770

Multiplying both sides by LCM(8,18) = 72, we get:

(63/72) * x - (28/72) * x = 770
(35/72) * x = 770
x = (72/35) * 770

Therefore, 

Action: Answer("B") which is 2520.
Response 3:
To solve the problem, we can use the formula:  
`difference = actual value - obtained value`

Let the number be `x`.
Given the student found the value of `7/18` of the number instead of `7/8`.
Therefore, the difference in the value will be:
`7/8*x - 7/18*x = 770`
`35x/72 = 770`
`x = 1584`

Hence, the answer is A. `1584`.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")  

Let's assume that the actual number is N.  
So, the student found the value of (7/18) of N instead of (7/8) of N.  

Let's calculate the difference between the two values:  
(7/8)N - (7/18)N = 770  

Simplifying the equation:  
N = (770 * 36) / 1 = 27720  

Therefore, the actual number is 27720.  

Now, let's check the answer options:  
(A) 1584 = (7/18) * 396 < (7/8) * 396  
(B) 2520 = (7/18) * 630 > (7/8) * 630  
(C) 1728 = (7/18) * 432 < (7/8) * 432  
(D) 1656 = (7/18) * 414 < (7/8) * 414  

So, the answer is (A) 1584.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Solution:
Let the actual number be x.

The difference between 7/8 of the actual number and 7/18 of the actual number is:
= 7/8 x - 7/18 x
= (63x - 28x)/72
= 35/72 x

As per the question, we have:
35/72 x = 770

Solving for x:
x = (770 * 72)/35
x = 1584

Answer: Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")  
Solution: 

Let's assume that actual number is A. 
The student found 7/18 of the actual number A, thus his calculation was (7/18)*A. 
Instead he was supposed to find 7/8 of the actual number A, thus the correct calculation would have been (7/8)*A. 
The difference between the student's answer and the actual answer is given to be 770. 

So, we can get the equation as follows: 
(7/8)*A - (7/18)*A = 770
(77A/72) - (14A/72) = 770 
63A/72 = 770 
A= (72*770)/63 = 2520

Therefore, the actual number is 2520 which is option B.
Response 8:
Let's use algebra to solve this problem:

Let x = the number
Actual value = (7/8)x
Wrong value = (7/18)x

The difference between the two values is given as 770. Therefore:

(7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770

We can simplify this equation by finding a common denominator:

(63/72)x - (28/72)x = 770

(35/72)x = 770

x = (72/35) * 770

x = 1584

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1584.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let the number be x.
7/8 of the number is 7x/8.
7/18 of the number is 7x/18.
The difference between the two can be expressed as: 7x/8 - 7x/18 = 770.
Simplifying the expression on the left, we get (63x - 28x)/72 = 770.
Solving for x, we get x = 2520.

Action: Answer("A") 

Solution: 
The cost per quarter mile is 10 cents or $0.10. 
The initial fee is $3.50. 
Let's say that you travel x quarters of a mile. 
Then the cost of the whole trip will be 3.50 + 0.10 * (x - 1). 
We want to know how far we can travel with $8.50, so we set the cost of the trip equal to $8.50 and solve for x: 

3.50 + 0.10 * (x - 1) = 8.50 
0.10 * (x - 1) = 5.00 
x - 1 = 50 
x = 51 

So the maximum distance you can travel is 51 quarters of a mile, which is 12.75 miles.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cylindrical can containing pieces of fruit is filled to the top with syrup before being sealed. The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. If $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, which of the following is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can?
Choices:
  A: $7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  B: $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  C: $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  D: $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 0:
Let's start by finding the volume of the can. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, the radius is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $V_{\text{can}} = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the fruit is $V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{can}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 482 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

The volume of the fruit is equal to the product of the area of the base and the height of the fruit. Let $h_{\text{fruit}}$ be the height of the fruit. Then we have $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \cdot h_{\text{fruit}} = 482 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, so $h_{\text{fruit}} \approx 6.43 \mathrm{~cm}$.

Finally, the volume of the fruit is $V_{\text{fruit}} = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (6.43 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 372 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation to eliminate $w$. This gives us $t=3$. Substituting this value of $t$ into the first equation gives us $w=4$. Therefore, $2w+3t=2(4)+3(3)=8+9=\boxed{13}$.

The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D") 

Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\cdot 100\% = 5\%$. Let $y$ be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is $2y$. 

Using the percent increase formula, we have:

\begin{align*}
x &= 5880(1+y/100) \\
5,880(1+y/100) &= 5600(1+2y/100) \\
5880 + 58.8y &= 5600 + 112y \\
53.2y &= 280 \\
y &= 5.26
\end{align*}

Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is:

\begin{align*}
x &= 5880(1+y/100) \\
&= 5880(1+5.26/100) \\
&= 6468

Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\cdot 100\% = 5\%$. Let $y$ be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is $2y$. 

Using the percent increase formula, we have:

\begin{align*}
x &= 5880(1+y/100) \\
5,880(1+y/100) &= 5600(1+2y/100) \\
5880 + 58.8y &= 5600 + 112y \\
53.2y &= 280 \\
y &= 5.26
\end{align*}

Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is:

\begin{align*}
x &= 5880(1+y/100) \\
&= 5880(1+5.26/100) \\
&= 6468
\end{align*}

Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }6,468}$.

  A: 2
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 6
Response 0:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries "x" 100-pound packages and "y" 120-pound packages. We know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y ≥ 10. We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y ≤ 1,100. We want to find the maximum value of y, which is the number of 120-pound packages.

To solve for y, we can use the first inequality to get x ≥ 10 - y. Substituting this into the second inequality, we get:

100(10 - y) + 120y ≤ 1,100
1,000 - 100y + 120y ≤ 1,100
20y ≤ 100
y ≤ 5

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$
Response 0:
To find the linear function that models the production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of 2.1 million barrels over 13 years. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13}$ million barrels per year. 

To find the slope of the linear function, we need to express the years after 2000 as $t$ and the production in millions of barrels as $f(t)$. Since the production decreased, the slope should be negative. 

Using the point-slope form of a linear equation, we have:

$f(t)-4 = -\frac{2.1}{13}t$

$f(t) = -\frac{2.1}{13}t + 4$

Therefore, the answer is:

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline1 & 5 \\\hline3 & 13 \\\hline5 & 21 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of the linear function $f$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=2 x+3$
  B: $f(x)=3 x+2$
  C: $f(x)=4 x+1$
  D: $f(x)=5 x$
Response 0:
We can see that the slope of the line connecting the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. Similarly, the slope of the line connecting the points $(3,13)$ and $(5,21)$ is $\frac{21-13}{5-3}=4$. Therefore, the slope of the line connecting $(1,5)$ and $(5,21)$ is also 4. We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line: $f(x)-5=4(x-1)$, which simplifies to $f(x)=4x+1$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4 x+1}$.

Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
The 180 food calories in the granola bar come from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate. Using the table, we can convert these calories to grams and set up the equation: $4p+9f+4c=180$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{1}{9}(180-4p-4c)=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.

Topic: Math
Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: At what price will the quantity of the product supplied to the market equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 90$
  B: $\$ 120$
  C: $\$ 133$
  D: $\$ 155$
Response 0:
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we need to find the price $P$ that satisfies the equation $S(P)=D(P)$.

Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100
Response 0:
First, we can simplify the equation to $0.02x=0.02y$, which means $x=y$. Therefore, Clayton must use an equal amount of both solutions. If he uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ solution, then he must use 100 milliliters of the $10 \%$ solution.

The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate of change of the monthly rental price with respect to the purchase price. The slope can be calculated by finding the difference in rental prices and dividing by the difference in purchase prices between any two properties. For example, using the first and second properties: 

slope $= \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = 6$

This means that for every $1000 increase in purchase price, the monthly rental price increases by $6 \times 1000 = 6000$ dollars. 

We can check that this holds true for the other pairs of properties as well. 

Using the slope and one of the properties, we can find the y-intercept of the function. For example, using the first property: 

$r = 6p + b$
$950 = 6(128) + b$
$b = 142$

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price and purchase price is:

$r(p) = 6p + 142$

We can see that this matches with choice $\textbf{(C)}$.

Topic: Math
Question: Survey Results\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\hlineAnswer & Percent \\\hlineNever & $31.3 \%$ \\\hlineRarely & $24.3 \%$ \\\hlineOften & $13.5 \%$ \\\hlineAlways & $30.9 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the results of a survey in which tablet users were asked how often they would watch video advertisements in order to access streaming content for free. Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
Response 0:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B),$ which is given by \[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.\] We can find $P(B)$ by adding the percentages of tablet users who answered "Rarely," "Often," and "Always," which is $24.3\%+13.5\%+30.9\% = 68.7\%.$ To find $P(A\cap B),$ we need to find the percentage of tablet users who answered "Always" and did not answer "Never." This is simply $30.9\%,$ since $31.3\%$ answered "Never." Therefore, \[P(A|B) = \frac{30.9\%}{68.7\%} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}.\]

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and the second equation by $-3$, then adding the two resulting equations to eliminate $y$:
$$\begin{aligned} &-2(2x-3y=-14) \\ &-3(3x-2y=-6) \\ \end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned} &-4x+6y=28 \\ &-9x+6y=18 \\ \end{aligned}$$
Adding the two equations gives $-13x=46$, so $x=-\frac{46}{13}$. Substituting this value of $x$ into either of the original equations gives $y=-\frac{20}{13}$. Therefore, $x-y=-\frac{46}{13}+\frac{20}{13}=-\frac{26}{13}=-8$.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 0:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The total number of calories in the mixture is the sum of the calories from each cereal. We know that Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, which is equivalent to 280 calories per cup. Therefore, the number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal in the mixture is $280\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$. 

We also know that the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270. Therefore, the number of calories from Super Grain cereal in the mixture is $270-280\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$. 

We can set up an equation to solve for $x$: 

\begin{align*}
240x + 50\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right) &= 270-280\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right) \\
240x + 37.5 - 50x &= 270 - 210 + 280x \\
190x &= 97.5 \\
x &= \frac{97.5}{190} \approx 0.513
\end{align*}

Therefore, Jennifer mixes approximately $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}}$ of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{97.5}{760} \approx 0.237$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal.

We know that Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, which is equivalent to 280 calories per cup. Therefore, the number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal in the mixture is $280\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$. 

We also know that the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270. Therefore, the number of calories from Super Grain cereal in the mixture is $270-280\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$. 

We can set up an equation to solve for $x$: 

\begin{align*}
240x + 50\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right) &= 270-280\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right) \\
240x + 37.5 - 50x &= 270 - 210 + 280x \\
190x &= 97.5 \\
x &= \frac{97.5}{190} \approx 0.513
\end{align*}

Therefore, Jennifer mixes approximately $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}}$ of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{97.5}{760} \approx 0.237$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal.

To find the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line, we need to find the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. 

Action: Answer("C") 

The given equation can be rewritten in slope-intercept form as $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$. The negative reciprocal of this slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

The equation $2x+4y=6$ can be rewritten in slope-intercept form as $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{1}{2}$.

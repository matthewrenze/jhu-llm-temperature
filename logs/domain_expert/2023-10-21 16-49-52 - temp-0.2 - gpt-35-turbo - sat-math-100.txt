Question: A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 10,800$
  B: $\$ 16,200$
  C: $\$ 21,600$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
We can solve this problem by using linear depreciation. Since the equipment depreciates at a constant rate, we can find the rate by dividing the initial value by the number of years it depreciates over: 

$$\text{Depreciation rate} = \frac{\$32,400}{12 \text{ years}} = \$2,700 \text{ per year}$$

After 4 years, the equipment will have depreciated by $4 \times \$2,700 = \$10,800$. Therefore, the equipment will be worth:

$$\text{Value after 4 years} = \$32,400 - \$10,800 = \$21,600$$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the equipment depreciates at a rate of $x$ dollars per year. After 12 years, the equipment will have depreciated by $12x$ dollars, so its value will be $32,400 - 12x$. 

To find out how much the equipment is worth 4 years after it is purchased, we need to subtract the amount that it has depreciated in those 4 years from its original value: 

$32,400 - 4x$

We don't know the value of $x$, but we can set up an equation using the fact that the equipment depreciates at a constant rate: 

$\frac{32,400}{12} = x$

Simplifying, we get $x = 2,700$. 

Now we can substitute this value of $x$ into our equation for the value of the equipment after 4 years: 

$32,400 - 4(2,700) = 21,600$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$ 21,600$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let's assume that the equipment depreciates at a constant rate $d$ per year. After 12 years, the equipment will have depreciated by $12d$ and its value will be $32,400 - 12d$. Therefore, we can find $d$ by solving the equation:

$32,400 - 12d = 0$

$d = \frac{32,400}{12} = 2,700$

So the equipment depreciates by $\$ 2,700$ per year. 

After 4 years, the equipment will have depreciated by $4 \times 2,700 = 10,800$, so its value will be:

$32,400 - 10,800 = 21,600$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$ 21,600$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let the value of the equipment after $4$ years be $x$. Since the equipment depreciates at a constant rate, we can assume that the value of the equipment decreases linearly over time. Therefore, the value of the equipment after $12$ years will be $0$. 

We can use the two data points $(0, 32400)$ and $(12, 0)$ to find the equation of the line that represents the value of the equipment over time. 

The slope of the line is $\frac{0-32400}{12-0}=-2700$. 

Using the point-slope form of a line, we get:

$$y-0=-2700(x-12)$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$y=-2700x+32400$$

Substituting $x=4$, we get:

$$y=-2700(4)+32400=21600$$

Therefore, the value of the equipment after 4 years is $\$ 21,600$.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cylindrical can containing pieces of fruit is filled to the top with syrup before being sealed. The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. If $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, which of the following is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can?
Choices:
  A: $7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  B: $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  C: $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  D: $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 0:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylindrical can using the given information. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, we can find the radius by solving the equation $75 = \pi r^2$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $V = \pi r^2 h = \pi (4.33)^2 (10) \approx 591.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is $V_{\text{fruit}} = V - 110 \approx 481.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. However, we need to be careful here because the fruit does not fill the entire volume of the can. There is some empty space between the fruit that is filled with syrup. This means that the volume of the fruit is less than $481.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Since we don't know the shape or size of the fruit, we can't calculate the exact volume of the fruit. However, we can make an estimate based on the fact that the fruit is likely to be irregularly shaped and take up less space than a cylinder of the same volume. Therefore, the most likely answer is the smallest option, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 1:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. The height of the cylinder is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is approximately $V = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 591.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

We are also given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. This means that the volume of the fruit plus the syrup is $591.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} + 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 701.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

To find the volume of the fruit, we can subtract the volume of the syrup from the total volume. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is approximately $701.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 591.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Answer: Choice D: $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ (closest to $591.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$)
Response 2:
Let's start by finding the volume of the can using the given information. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, the radius is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $\pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the fruit is $592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 482 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Therefore, the answer is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 3:
Let the radius of the cylindrical can be $r$. The volume of the syrup is $\pi r^2 h = 110 \mathrm{~cm}^3$. We are given that $h = 10 \mathrm{~cm}$, so $\pi r^2 = 11$. The total volume of the can is $\pi r^2 h = 110 \mathrm{~cm}^3$. The volume of the fruit is the difference between the total volume of the can and the volume of the syrup, which is $110 - 75 = 35 \mathrm{~cm}^3$. 

The volume of the fruit is equal to the volume of a cylinder with radius $r$ and height $h$. Thus, $\pi r^2 h = 35$. We can solve for $r$ by dividing both sides by $h$ and then by $\pi$: $r^2 = \frac{35}{10\pi} = \frac{7}{2\pi}$. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is $\pi r^2 h = \pi \cdot \frac{7}{2\pi} \cdot 10 = 35 \mathrm{~cm}^3$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's start by finding the volume of the can. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, the radius is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $V_{\text{can}} = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the fruit is $V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{can}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 481 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

The volume of the fruit is equal to the product of the area of the base and the height of the fruit. Let $h_{\text{fruit}}$ be the height of the fruit. Then we have $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \cdot h_{\text{fruit}} = 481 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, so $h_{\text{fruit}} \approx 6.41 \mathrm{~cm}$.

Therefore, the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is approximately $V_{\text{fruit}} = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (6.41 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height. Substituting the given values, we get:

$V = Bh = 75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \cdot 10 \mathrm{~cm} = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

This is the total volume of the can, including the syrup and the fruit. To find the volume of the fruit, we need to subtract the volume of the syrup from the total volume. We are given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, so the volume of the fruit is:

$750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
Response 6:
Let's start by finding the volume of the can using the given information. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, we know that the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $V_{\text{can}} = \pi (\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}})^2 (10) \approx 235.62 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the fruit in the can is $V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{can}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 125.62 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. However, we need to be careful here because the fruit is not in the shape of a cylinder. We can make a reasonable estimate by assuming that the fruit takes up about 80% of the volume of the can (since the syrup fills in the gaps between the fruit). Therefore, the volume of the fruit is approximately $0.8 V_{\text{fruit}} \approx 100.50 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Let's start by finding the volume of the can. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, the radius is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $V_{\text{can}} = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

The volume of the syrup is given as $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is $V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{can}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 481 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

The volume of the fruit is equal to the product of the base area and the height of the fruit. Therefore, the height of the fruit is $V_{\text{fruit}}/75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \approx 6.41 \mathrm{~cm}$. 

Finally, the total height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, so the height of the syrup is $10 \mathrm{~cm} - 6.41 \mathrm{~cm} \approx 3.59 \mathrm{~cm}$. 

Therefore, the volume of the fruit is approximately equal to the volume of a cylinder with base area $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and height $6.41 \mathrm{~cm}$, which is $V_{\text{fruit}} \approx \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (6.41 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 370 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

The closest answer choice is (B) $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let's start by finding the volume of the can using the given information. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, we can find the radius by solving the equation $75 = \pi r^2$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $V = \pi r^2 h = \pi (4.33)^2 (10) \approx 591.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is $V_{\text{fruit}} = V - 110 \approx 481.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. However, we need to be careful here because the pieces of fruit do not fill the entire volume of the can. We can assume that the fruit is packed tightly and takes up about 75% of the volume of the can. Therefore, the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is approximately $0.75 V_{\text{fruit}} \approx 361 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

The closest answer choice to this value is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 9:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height. Substituting the given values, we get:

$V = Bh = 75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \cdot 10 \mathrm{~cm} = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

We are told that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. This means that the volume of the fruit is:

$750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation. This gives us $-7t=-11$ which implies $t=\frac{11}{7}$. Substituting this value of $t$ in the first equation gives us $w=\frac{1}{7}$. Thus, $2w+3t=2\cdot\frac{1}{7}+3\cdot\frac{11}{7}=\frac{13}{7}$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }13}$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation, which eliminates $w$ and gives us $t=3$. Substituting this value of $t$ into the first equation gives us $w=4$. Therefore, $2w+3t=2(4)+3(3)=8+9=\boxed{13}$.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A") 

We can start by expanding the left side of the equation: 
$$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=5ax^3- abx^2+20x^2+12ax-3bx+12$$
Simplifying the right side of the equation: 
$$20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12=20x^3-9x^2-2x+12$$
Since the equation is true for all $x$, we can equate the coefficients of each term on both sides of the equation. 
Comparing the coefficients of $x^3$ gives $5a=20$, so $a=4$. 
Comparing the coefficients of $x^2$ gives $-ab+20=-9$, so $ab=29$. 
Therefore, the answer is $ab=4\times 29=116$, which is not one of the available choices. The closest answer is A, 18, which is the product of $2$ and $9$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A") 

We can start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation: 

$$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=5ax^3- abx^2+20x^2+12ax-3bx+12$$

Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get: 

$$20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12 = 20x^3 - 9x^2 - 2x + 12$$

Comparing the coefficients of the like terms on both sides of the equation, we get the following system of equations: 

$$5a = 20 \Rightarrow a = 4$$
$$-ab + 20 = -9 \Rightarrow ab = 18$$

Therefore, the value of $ab$ is 18, which is option A.

Response 0:
We can simplify $4z+8y$ by substituting $z=a^{2}+b^{2}$ and $y=ab$:
$$4z+8y=4(a^{2}+b^{2})+8(ab)$$
$$=4a^{2}+4b^{2}+8ab+4ab+4b^{2}$$
$$=4(a^{2}+2ab+b^{2})+4b^{2}$$
$$=4(a+b)^{2}+4b^{2}$$
$$=4[(a+b)^{2}+b^{2}]$$

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $a$ & $3 a$ & $5 a$ \\\hline$y$ & 0 & $-a$ & $-2 a$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$ are shown in the table above, where $a$ is a constant. If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?

  A: $x+2 y=a$
  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
Response 0:
We can use the given table to form two equations: $a+0b=0$, $3a+(-a)b=0$, and $5a+(-2a)b=0$. Simplifying these equations gives us $a=0$, $2a=0$, and $5a=2ab$. Since $a$ cannot be zero, we can divide both sides of the third equation by $a$ to get $5=2b$. Solving for $b$ gives us $b=\frac{5}{2}$. Therefore, the equation that represents the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $x+2y=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 5a}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
We can use the given table to form two equations relating $x$ and $y$:
\begin{align*}
0a+2y&=y=0a+2(0a)\\
3a+2y&=-a+2(0a)\\
5a+2y&=-2a+2(0a)
\end{align*}
Simplifying each equation, we get:
\begin{align*}
y&=0\\
y&=-a\\
y&=-2a
\end{align*}
We can see that $y$ is equal to $-2x$ when $x=5a$, so the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is linear. We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation that represents the relationship:
\begin{align*}
y-(-2a)&=-2(x-5a)\\
y+2a&=-2x+10a\\
\end{align*}
Simplifying, we get:
$$2x-y=7a$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 2x-y=7a}$.
Response 2:
We can use the given table to form two equations in the form of $y=mx+b$ and then check which of the given equations is satisfied by these values of $x$ and $y$. 

From the table, we can see that when $x=a$, $y=0$, and when $x=3a$, $y=-a$. We can use these two points to form the equation of the line: 

Slope $m = \frac{-a-0}{3a-a} = -1$ 

$y = -x + b$

$0 = -a + b \implies b=a$

Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=-x+a$. 

Now we can check which of the given equations is satisfied by these values of $x$ and $y$. 

Substituting $y=-x+a$ into each of the given equations, we get: 

A: $x+2y=a \implies x+2(-x+a)=a \implies a=a$, which is true. 

B: $x+2y=5a \implies x+2(-x+a)=5a \implies a=3a$, which is false. 

C: $2x-y=-5a \implies 2x-(-x+a)=-5a \implies a=-3a$, which is false. 

D: $2x-y=7a \implies 2x-(-x+a)=7a \implies a=5a$, which is false. 

Therefore, the only equation that is satisfied by the given values of $x$ and $y$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ x+2y=a}$.
Response 3:
We can use the given table to form two equations:
\begin{align*}
0a + b &= 0, \\
5a + b &= -2a.
\end{align*}
Solving this system gives $a = -\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = 0$. Therefore, the equation that represents the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $x + 2y = 0a + 0b = 0$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
We can use the given table to form two equations. Since there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we can assume that the relationship can be expressed in the form $y=mx+b$ for some constants $m$ and $b$. We can then use the given values of $x$ and $y$ to form two equations in terms of $m$ and $b$.

From the table, we can see that when $x=a$, $y=0$. This gives us the equation $0=ma+b$ or $ma=-b$.

Similarly, we can see that when $x=3a$, $y=-a$. This gives us the equation $-a=3ma+b$ or $b=-4ma$.

Substituting $b=-4ma$ into the first equation, we get $ma=4ma$ or $m=4$.

Substituting $m=4$ into $ma=-b$, we get $-4a=-b$ or $b=4a$.

Therefore, the equation that represents the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $y=4x+4a$.

To check which of the given equations is equivalent to $y=4x+4a$, we can rearrange it to get $4x-y=-4a$. This matches choice $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2x-y=-5a}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
We can use the given table to form three equations: $0=a+b$, $-a=3a+b$, and $-2a=5a+b$. Solving for $a$ and $b$, we get $a=-\frac{1}{4}a$ and $b=0$. Thus, the equation relating $x$ and $y$ is $x+2y=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }a}$.
Response 6:
We can use the given table to form two equations: $a+0b=0$, $3a+(-a)b=0$, and $5a+(-2a)b=0$. Simplifying these equations gives us $a=0$, $2a=0$, and $5a=2ab$. Since $a$ cannot be zero, we can divide the third equation by $5a$ to get $1=\frac{2b}{5}$, which gives us $b=\frac{5}{2}$. Therefore, the equation that represents the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $2x-y=5a$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
We can see that the slope of the line connecting the points $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$ is $\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-1$. Similarly, the slope of the line connecting $(3a,-a)$ and $(5a,-2a)$ is $\frac{-2a+a}{5a-3a}=-\frac{a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}$. Since the slopes are constant, we know that the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is linear. Using the point-slope form of a line, we can find the equation of the line connecting $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$ to be $y+a=-1(x-3a)$, which simplifies to $x+y=4a$. Using the same method, we can find the equation of the line connecting $(3a,-a)$ and $(5a,-2a)$ to be $y+2a=-\frac{1}{2}(x-5a)$, which simplifies to $x+2y=9a$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ x+2y=5a}$.
Response 8:
We can use the given table to form two equations relating $x$ and $y$. Since there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we know that these two equations must be linearly dependent, so we can solve for $a$ by setting the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ equal to each other. 

One possible set of equations is:
\begin{align*}
a &= 3a + 0 \\
-a &= 5a - 2a
\end{align*}
Simplifying the second equation gives $-a = 3a$, so $a = 0$. 

Therefore, the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $x + 2y = \boxed{0}$, which is not one of the answer choices.
Response 9:
We can use the given table to form two equations in the form of $y=mx+b$ and then solve for $m$ and $b$ to see which equation matches the given choices. 

From the table, we can see that when $x=a$, $y=0$, so one point on the line is $(a,0)$. Similarly, when $x=3a$, $y=-a$, so another point on the line is $(3a,-a)$. 

The slope of the line is then $\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-\frac{1}{2}$, and using the point-slope form of a line, the equation of the line is $y-0=-\frac{1}{2}(x-a)$, which simplifies to $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}a$. 

Multiplying both sides by $-2$ gives $2y=x-a$, which rearranges to $x+2y=a$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } x+2y=a}$.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
Response 0:
We can use the given information to convert 2 decagrams to milligrams: $$2\text{ dag}=2\times10\text{ g}=2\times10\times1000\text{ mg}=20,000\text{ mg}$$
Since there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container, there are also 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
We can use the given conversion factors to convert from decagrams to grams to milligrams. 

$$\begin{aligned} 2 \text{ decagrams } &= 20 \text{ grams } \\ &= 20,000 \text{ milligrams } \end{aligned}$$

Since there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2,\!000}$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(C)}$.
Response 2:
Since 1 decagram is equal to 10 grams, then 2 decagrams is equal to 20 grams. Since 1,000 milligrams is equal to 1 gram, then 20 grams is equal to 20,000 milligrams. Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
$1$ decagram $=10$ grams $=10,000$ milligrams. Therefore, $2$ decagrams $=20,000$ milligrams. Since there are $20,000$ milligrams in one 2-decagram container, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 20,000}$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Alternatively, we can use unit conversions to get from 2 decagrams to milligrams: $$2\text{ dag}\cdot\frac{10\text{ g}}{1\text{ dag}}\cdot\frac{1000\text{ mg}}{1\text{ g}}=20,\!000\text{ mg}.$$
Response 4:
1 decagram = 10 grams = 10,000 milligrams

Therefore, 2 decagrams = 20,000 milligrams

Since there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container, there are 20,000 one-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Since 1 decagram is equal to 10 grams, then 2 decagrams is equal to 20 grams. And since 1,000 milligrams is equal to 1 gram, then 20 grams is equal to 20,000 milligrams. Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
We can use the given information to convert the weight of the medicine in the container from decagrams to milligrams, and then divide by 1 milligram to find the number of doses. 

\begin{align*}
2\text{ decagrams} &= 2 \cdot 10 \cdot 100 \text{ milligrams} \\
&= 2000 \text{ milligrams} \\
\frac{2000 \text{ milligrams}}{1 \text{ milligram/dose}} &= \boxed{\textbf{(C) }2000}
\end{align*}
Response 7:
We can use the given information to convert from decagrams to grams to milligrams: $$\begin{aligned} 1 \text{ decagram } &= 10 \text{ grams } \\ &= 10 \times 1000 \text{ milligrams } \\ &= 10,000 \text{ milligrams } \end{aligned}$$So, one 2-decagram container is equal to $2 \times 10,000 = 20,000$ milligrams. Since we want to find the number of 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container, we divide 20,000 by 1: $$\frac{20,\!000 \text{ milligrams}}{1 \text{ milligram/dose}} = 20,\!000 \text{ doses}$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }20,000}$.
Response 8:
One 2-decagram container is equal to $2 \times 10 = 20$ grams. Since $1,000$ milligrams is equal to $1$ gram, then $20$ grams is equal to $20,000$ milligrams. Therefore, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 20,000}$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

We can also set up the following proportion to solve the problem: $$\frac{1 \text{ decagram}}{10,000 \text{ milligrams}} = \frac{2 \text{ decagrams}}{x \text{ milligrams}}$$ Solving for $x$, we get $x = 20,000$ which confirms our answer.
Response 9:
One 2-decagram container is equal to $2 \times 10=20$ grams. Since $1,000$ milligrams is equal to $1$ gram, then $20$ grams is equal to $20,000$ milligrams. Therefore, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 20,000}$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
We know that the line passes through the origin, so the coordinates of both points must satisfy the equation of the line $y=mx$, where $m$ is the slope of the line. 

The slope of the line is $\frac{32-k}{k-2}$. 

If the line passes through the origin, then we must have $k\neq 0$ and $32=km$. 

Substituting $m=\frac{32-k}{k-2}$, we get $32=k\cdot\frac{32-k}{k-2}$. 

Simplifying this equation, we get $k^2-64k+128=0$. 

Using the quadratic formula, we get $k=32\pm 16\sqrt{2}$. 

Therefore, the possible values of $k$ are $32+16\sqrt{2}$ and $32-16\sqrt{2}$.

$32 = 2m^2$

$m^2 = 16$

$m = \pm 4$

Substituting $m=4$ into the first equation, we get:

$k = 2m = 8$

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}Year & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Subscriptions } \\ \text { sold }\end{array}$ \\\hline2012 & 5,600 \\2013 & 5,880 \\\end{tabular}\end{center}The manager of an online news service received the report above on the number of subscriptions sold by the service. The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can start by finding the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: 

$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05$ or 5%. 

Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, according to the problem, we have: 

$2(0.05) = 0.1 = \frac{5880-5880(1+x)}{5880(1+x)}$

Solving for x, we get $x = 0.086$. 

Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is approximately: 

$5880(1+0.086) \approx 6468$ 

So the answer is (D) 6,468.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D") 

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase:
percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, we have:

- From 2012 to 2013: percent increase = $\frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
- From 2013 to 2014: percent increase = $\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$

The problem tells us that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is half of the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. So we can write:

$\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 5\% = 2.5\%$

Solving for x, we get:

$x - 5,880 = 0.025 \times 5,880 = 147$

$x = 5,880 + 147 = 6,027$

Therefore, the manager expected 6,027 subscriptions to be sold in 2014, which is answer choice D.
Response 2:
First, we need to find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: 

$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05$ or 5%. 

Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 would be 2x. 

Using the percent increase formula, we can set up the following equation: 

$1.05(1+x) = 1 + 2x$

Simplifying and solving for x, we get: 

$x = 0.1$

So the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is 10%. 

To find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, we can use: 

$5880(1+0.1) \approx 6,468$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can start by finding the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: 

$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05$ or 5%. 

Let $x$ be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, according to the problem, we have: 

$2(0.05) = 0.1 = \frac{5880-5880(1+x)}{5880(1+x)}$. 

Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{1}{11}$. 

Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is approximately: 

$5880(1+\frac{1}{11}) \approx 6468$. 

So the answer is (D) 6,468.
Response 4:
First, we need to find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 and the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. 

The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is: 

$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \cdot 100\% \approx 5\%$

Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, according to the problem, we have:

$2(5\%) = x$

$x = 10\%$

So the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is 10%. 

To find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, we can start with the number sold in 2013 and add 10% of that amount:

$5,880 + 0.1(5,880) = 6,468$

Therefore, the manager expected 6,468 subscriptions to be sold in 2014. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase: 

percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, we have:

- From 2012 to 2013: percent increase = $\frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
- From 2013 to 2014: percent increase = $\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$

The problem tells us that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is half of the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. So we can write:

$\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 5\% = 2.5\%$

Solving for x, we get:

$x - 5,880 = 0.025 \times 5,880 = 147$

$x = 5,880 + 147 = 6,027$

Therefore, the manager expected 6,027 subscriptions to be sold in 2014, which is closest to choice C (6,440).

$2(0.05) = 0.1 = \frac{5880-5880(1+x)}{5880(1+x)}$

Solving for x, we get:

$x \approx 0.085$

Therefore, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is approximately 8.5%. 

To find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, we can use:

$5880(1+0.085) \approx 6,468$

So the manager expected approximately 6,468 subscriptions to be sold in 2014. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's first find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: 

Percent increase $= \frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Percent increase from 2012 to 2013 $= \frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$

Let's call the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 $x$. 

Now, we are given that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is half of the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. 

Percent increase from 2013 to 2014 $= \frac{1}{2} \times 5\% = 2.5\%$

So, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is:

$x + 0.025x = 1.025x$

We can estimate this value by adding 2.5% of $x$ to $x$:

$1.025x \approx 5,880 + 0.025(5,880) \approx 6,027$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }6,027}$.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company purchased a machine valued at $\$ 120,000$. The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year so that after 10 years the value will be $\$ 30,000$. Which of the following equations gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased for $0 \leq t \leq 10 ?$
Choices:
  A: $v=30,000-9,000 t$
  B: $v=120,000-9,000 t$
  C: $v=120,000+9,000 t$
  D: $v=120,000-30,000 t$
Response 0:
We can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year, so the slope of the line is constant. We can find the slope by taking the difference in the y-coordinates and dividing by the difference in the x-coordinates: 

slope $= \dfrac{30,000-120,000}{10-0} = -9,000$

The y-intercept is the initial value of the machine, which is $\$ 120,000$. 

So the equation of the line is: 

$v = -9,000t + 120,000$

Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
We can find the rate of depreciation by dividing the total depreciation by the number of years: $\frac{120,000-30,000}{10}=9,000$. Therefore, the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased is $v=120,000-9,000t$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
To find the value of the machine, we need to determine the annual depreciation rate. The machine depreciates by $(120,000-30,000)/10 = 9,000$ dollars per year. 

At time $t=0$, the value of the machine is $v=120,000$. After $t$ years, the value of the machine will have decreased by $9,000t$ dollars. Therefore, the equation that gives the value of the machine in dollars $t$ years after it was purchased is:

$v=120,000-9,000t$

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
To find the depreciation per year, we can subtract the final value from the initial value and divide by the number of years: 

$\frac{\$120,000 - \$30,000}{10 \text{ years}} = \$9,000$

So, the value of the machine after $t$ years can be found by subtracting $9,000t$ from the initial value of $\$120,000$.

Question: Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week?
Choices:
  A: 38
  B: 33
  C: 22
  D: 16
Response 0:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours in the beginning of the week. His total earnings for the week is $8(10) + 10x = 80 + 10x$. Since Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, he saves $0.9(80+10x) = 72 + 9x$ dollars. We want to solve the inequality $72+9x \geq 270$. Solving this inequality gives $x \geq 22$. The least integer greater than or equal to $22$ is $22$. Therefore, Ken must work at least $22$ hours the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week.

Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours with a rate of $\$ 8$ per hour, so he earned $\$ 80$ from that. For the rest of the week, he worked $x$ hours with a rate of $\$ 10$ per hour, so he earned $\$ 10x$. Therefore, his total earnings for the week is $\$ 80 + \$ 10x$. 

He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(\$ 80 + \$ 10x) = \$ 72 + \$ 9x$. We want to find the least $x$ such that $\$ 72 + \$ 9x \geq \$ 270$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \geq 22$. 

Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 7:
Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours in the first part of the week. His total earnings for the week is $8(10)+10h=80+10h$ dollars. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10h)=72+9h$ dollars. We want to find the least $h$ such that $72+9h\geq 270$. Solving for $h$, we get $h\geq 22$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 8:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours in the beginning of the week. His total earnings for the week is $8(10)+10x=80+10x$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$ dollars. We want to find the least $x$ such that $72+9x \geq 270$. Solving for $x$, we have $x \geq 22$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 9:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours with a rate of $\$ 8$ per hour, so he earned $\$ 80$ from those hours. For the remaining hours, he earns $\$ 10$ per hour. Therefore, he earns $10x$ dollars from the remaining hours. In total, he earns $80 + 10x$ dollars for the week. 

He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80 + 10x) = 72 + 9x$ dollars for the week. We want to find the least number of hours $x$ he must work to save at least $\$ 270$. 

Solving $72 + 9x \geq 270$ gives $x \geq 22$. The smallest integer greater than or equal to $22$ is $22$ itself. Therefore, Ken must work at least $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$ hours the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$.

Topic: Math
Question: A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages. For each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. What is the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 6
Response 0:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries "x" 100-pound packages and "y" 120-pound packages. We know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y ≥ 10. We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y ≤ 1,100. We want to find the maximum value of y, which is the number of 120-pound packages.

To solve for y, we can use the first inequality to get x ≥ 10 - y. Substituting this into the second inequality, we get:

100(10 - y) + 120y ≤ 1,100
1,000 - 100y + 120y ≤ 1,100
20y ≤ 100
y ≤ 5

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries 'x' 100-pound packages and 'y' 120-pound packages. We know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y >= 10. We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y <= 1,100.

To find the maximum number of 120-pound packages, we need to maximize 'y'. We can solve for 'y' in the first equation: y >= 10 - x. We can substitute this inequality into the second equation to get:

100x + 120(10 - x) <= 1,100
Simplifying the inequality, we get:
x <= 5

So the maximum number of 120-pound packages is 'y', and we can maximize 'y' by setting x = 5:
y <= 10 - x = 5

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's assume the number of 100-pound packages to be x and the number of 120-pound packages to be y. We know that x+y>=10 and 100x+120y<=1100. We need to find the maximum value of y. 

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 20: 5x+6y<=55. 

Now we can use substitution to solve for y: y<= (55-5x)/6. 

To maximize y, we need to minimize x. The smallest integer value of x that satisfies the first equation is x=5. 

Substituting x=5, we get y<=5. 

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Response 4:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries "x" 100-pound packages and "y" 120-pound packages. 

We know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y ≥ 10. 

We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so:

100x + 120y ≤ 1,100 

To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, we need to find the largest possible value of y. 

Let's start by simplifying the inequality: 

10x + 12y ≤ 110 

Divide both sides by 2: 

5x + 6y ≤ 55 

Now we can see that the largest possible value of y is 9 (when x = 1). 

If y = 10, then 5x ≤ -5, which is not possible. 

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 9.

To solve for y, we can use the first inequality to get x ≥ 10 - y, and substitute it into the second inequality:
100(10 - y) + 120y ≤ 1,100
1,000 - 100y + 120y ≤ 1,100
20y ≤ 100
y ≤ 5

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

1,000 - 100y + 120y ≤ 1,100
20y ≤ 100
y ≤ 5

So the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

To find the maximum number of 120-pound packages, we need to maximize 'y'. We can solve for 'y' in the first equation to get y ≥ 10 - x. We can substitute this inequality into the second equation to get 100x + 120(10 - x) ≤ 1,100. Simplifying this inequality gives us 1200 - 20x ≤ 1,100, which means 20x ≥ 100, or x ≥ 5.

So the helicopter must carry at least 5 100-pound packages. If it carries 5 100-pound packages, then the total weight of the packages is 100(5) + 120y = 500 + 120y, which must be at most 1,100. Solving for 'y' gives us y ≤ 5, so the maximum number of 120-pound packages is 5.

Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries "x" 100-pound packages and "y" 120-pound packages. We know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y ≥ 10. We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y ≤ 1,100. To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, we need to find the largest possible value of y. 

We can simplify the inequality 100x + 120y ≤ 1,100 by dividing both sides by 20: 

5x + 6y ≤ 55 

Now we can use the fact that x + y ≥ 10 to solve for x in terms of y: 

x ≥ 10 - y 

Substituting this into the inequality above, we get: 

5(10 - y) + 6y ≤ 55 

Simplifying: 

y ≤ 5 

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$
Response 0:
To find the linear function that models the production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear function, which is $f(t) = mt + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels over 13 years. Therefore, the average decrease per year is $\frac{2.1}{13} \approx 0.1615$ million barrels per year.

The slope of the linear function is the average decrease per year, which is approximately $-0.1615$ million barrels per year. 

To find the $y$-intercept, we can use the fact that the production was 4 million barrels in 2000, which means that $f(0) = 4$. 

Therefore, the linear function that models the production is:

$$f(t) = -0.1615t + 4$$

To match this to one of the given choices, we can simplify the slope:

$$f(t) = -\frac{1615}{10000}t + 4$$

Comparing this to the given choices, we see that the closest match is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To find the linear function that models the production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels over a period of 13 years. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13}\approx 0.1615$ million barrels per year.

The slope of the linear function that models the production is the rate of decrease, which is negative. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B, which have positive slopes.

To determine whether the slope is $-\frac{21}{130}$ or $-\frac{19}{130}$, we can use the $y$-intercept. We know that the production was 4 million barrels in 2000, which means that the $y$-intercept is 4. Therefore, we can plug in $t=0$ into the remaining choices and see which one gives us a $y$-intercept of 4.

Choice C gives us $f(0)=4$, since $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$ implies $f(0)=-\frac{21}{130}(0)+4=4$.

Therefore, the best linear function that models the production is $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$, so the answer is (C).
Response 2:
To find the linear function that models the oil and gas production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production decreased from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels over a period of 13 years. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13} \approx 0.1615$ million barrels per year. 

Since the production decreased, the slope of the linear function must be negative. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B, which have positive slopes. 

Now we need to choose between choices C and D. To do this, we can plug in the year 2013 (which is 13 years after 2000) and check which function gives us a value of 1.9 million barrels. 

For choice C, we have $f(13)=-\frac{21}{130}(13)+4 \approx 1.9$. 

For choice D, we have $f(13)=-\frac{19}{130}(13)+4 \approx 2.02$. 

Therefore, the best linear function that models the production is $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$, which is choice C. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
To find the linear function that models the production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production decreased from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of 2.1 million barrels over 13 years. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13}$ million barrels per year. 

Since we want to model the production $t$ years after 2000, we need to subtract 2000 from $t$ to get the number of years after 2000. 

So the equation that models the production is:

$f(t) = -\frac{2.1}{13} (t-2000) + 4$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$f(t) = -\frac{21}{130} t + \frac{542}{65}$

The closest answer choice to this equation is (A), so:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
To find the linear function that models the oil and gas production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of 2.1 million barrels over 13 years. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13}$ million barrels per year. 

Since we want to model the production $t$ years after 2000, we need to subtract 2000 from $t$ to get the number of years after 2000. So the function should be of the form $f(t)=mt+b$, where $m=-\frac{2.1}{13}$ is the slope and $b=4$ is the y-intercept. 

Simplifying, we get:

$$f(t)=-\frac{2.1}{13}t+4$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.
Response 5:
To find the linear function that models the oil and gas production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production decreased from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of 2.1 million barrels over 13 years. Therefore, the slope of the linear function is:

$m=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}=\frac{-2.1}{13}=-\frac{21}{130}$

The y-intercept is the initial production in 2000, which is 4 million barrels. Therefore, the linear function is:

$f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
To find the linear function that models the oil and gas production, we need to use the two given data points: $(0,4)$ and $(13,1.9)$, where $t=0$ corresponds to the year 2000. 

The slope of the line passing through these two points is given by: 

$$m = \frac{1.9-4}{13-0} = -\frac{21}{130}$$

Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we get:

$$f(t) - 4 = -\frac{21}{130} t$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$f(t) = -\frac{21}{130} t + 4$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.
Response 7:
To find the linear function that models the oil and gas production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels over a period of 13 years. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13}\approx0.1615$ million barrels per year. 

Since the production is decreasing, the slope of the linear function is negative. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B, which have positive slopes. 

Now we need to choose between choices C and D. To do this, we can plug in the year 2013 (which is 13 years after 2000) and see which function gives us a value of 1.9 million barrels. 

For choice C, we have $f(13)=-\frac{21}{130}(13)+4\approx1.9$, which is close to 1.9. 

For choice D, we have $f(13)=-\frac{19}{130}(13)+4\approx1.8$, which is not as close to 1.9 as choice C. 

Therefore, the best linear function that models the production is $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$, which is choice C.

To find the linear function that models the oil and gas production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production decreased from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels over 13 years. Therefore, the average decrease per year is $\frac{2.1}{13}\approx0.162$ million barrels per year.

The slope of the linear function is equal to the average decrease per year, which is approximately $-0.162$. 

To find the y-intercept, we can use the fact that the production was 4 million barrels in the year 2000, which means that $f(0)=4$. 

Putting it all together, we get:

$$f(t)=-0.162t+4$$

Therefore, the best linear function that models the production is given by choice $\textbf{(C)}$ $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.

Response 9:
To find the linear function that models the oil and gas production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels over 13 years. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13} \approx 0.1615$ million barrels per year.

The slope of the linear function is the rate of decrease, which is negative because the production is decreasing. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B because they have positive slopes.

The y-intercept of the linear function is the production in the year 2000, which is 4 million barrels. Therefore, we can eliminate choice C because it has a negative y-intercept.

The only remaining choice is D, which has a slope of $-\frac{19}{130}$ and a y-intercept of 4. Therefore, the linear function that best models the production is $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$.

  B: $P=-6 E+O+4 M$
  C: $P=\frac{O+4 M+E}{6}$
  D: $P=\frac{O+4 M-E}{6}$
Response 0:
We can solve for $P$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by $6$ and then subtracting $O+4M$ from both sides. This gives us: $$6E=O+4M+P$$$$6E-O-4M=P$$Therefore, the answer is:

$$6E=O+4M+P$$
$$P=6E-O-4M$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
We can solve for $P$ by multiplying both sides of the formula by $6$ and then subtracting $O+4M$ from both sides. This gives us: $$6E=O+4M+P$$$$6E-O-4M=P$$Therefore, the answer is:

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline1 & 5 \\\hline3 & 13 \\\hline5 & 21 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of the linear function $f$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=2 x+3$
  B: $f(x)=3 x+2$
  C: $f(x)=4 x+1$
  D: $f(x)=5 x$
Response 0:
To find the equation of the line, we need to find the slope and the $y$-intercept. The slope is given by $\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$. Using the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$, we get a slope of $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. Therefore, the equation of the line is of the form $f(x)=4x+b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Plugging in the point $(1,5)$, we get $5=4(1)+b$, so $b=1$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$, which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}}$.
Response 1:
We can see that the slope of the line connecting the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. Similarly, the slope of the line connecting the points $(3,13)$ and $(5,21)$ is $\frac{21-13}{5-3}=4$. Therefore, the slope of the line connecting any two points in the table is 4. Since $f(1)=5$, we know that the $y$-intercept of the line is $(0,1)$. Thus, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
We can use the given values to form a system of equations and solve for the slope and $y$-intercept of the linear function $f$. The slope is given by $\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$, which is $\frac{21-5}{5-1}=4$. To find the $y$-intercept, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation: $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope. Choosing $(1,5)$ as our point, we have $y-5=4(x-1)$. Simplifying, we get $y=4x+1$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4x+1}$.
Response 3:
We can use the two points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ to find the slope of the line. The slope is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. So the equation of the line is of the form $f(x)=4x+b$. We can then use the point $(1,5)$ to solve for $b$. We have $5=4(1)+b$, so $b=1$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}}$.
Response 4:
We can see that the slope of the line connecting the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. Similarly, the slope of the line connecting the points $(3,13)$ and $(5,21)$ is $\frac{21-13}{5-3}=4$. Therefore, the slope of the line connecting $(1,5)$ and $(5,21)$ is also 4. We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line: $f(x)-5=4(x-1)$, which simplifies to $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
We can see that when $x=1$, $f(x)=5$. When $x=3$, $f(x)=13$. When $x=5$, $f(x)=21$. We can notice that the difference between the $x$ values is $2$ and the difference between the $f(x)$ values is $8$. Therefore, the slope of the line is $\frac{8}{2}=4$. We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line. Using the point $(1,5)$, we get:

$$f(x)-5=4(x-1)$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$f(x)=4x+1$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4 x+1}$.
Response 6:
We can see that the slope of the line connecting the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. Similarly, the slope of the line connecting the points $(3,13)$ and $(5,21)$ is $\frac{21-13}{5-3}=4$. Therefore, the slope of the line connecting all three points is $4$. We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line: $y-5=4(x-1)$. Simplifying gives $y=4x+1$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4x+1}$.
Response 7:
We can see that the difference between the $x$-values is $2$ and the difference between the $f(x)$-values is $8$. Therefore, the slope of the line is $\frac{8}{2}=4$. We can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the line. Using the point $(1,5)$, we have $f(x)-5=4(x-1)$. Simplifying gives $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We can use the two points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ to find the slope of the line. The slope is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. So the equation of the line is of the form $f(x)=4x+b$. We can use the point $(1,5)$ to solve for $b$. We get $5=4(1)+b$, so $b=1$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To find the equation of a line, we need two things: the slope and the $y$-intercept. We can find the slope by computing the difference in $f(x)$ values over the difference in $x$ values. For example, the slope between $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. We can check that this slope works for all pairs of points: $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$ and $\frac{21-13}{5-3}=4$. 

Now that we know the slope is 4, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to find the $y$-intercept. For example, using the point $(1,5)$, we have $f(x)-5=4(x-1)$. Simplifying gives $f(x)=4x+1$. We can check that this equation works for all three points: $f(1)=5$, $f(3)=13$, and $f(5)=21$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4 x+1}$.

Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$
Response 0:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is equal to the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. From the table, we see that the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $39+125=164$, and the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is $11+68=79$. Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{79}{164}$$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Out of the 39 people who recalled 1 or more dreams, 68 - 11 = 57 people who belonged to Group Y recalled 5 or more dreams. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is $\frac{57}{39+57} = \frac{57}{96} = \frac{19}{32}$. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that the person recalled at least 1 dream is equal to the probability that the person belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream divided by the probability that the person recalled at least 1 dream. 

The probability that the person belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{68}{200}$. 

The probability that the person recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{39+125}{200}=\frac{164}{200}$. 

Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that the person recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{\frac{68}{200}}{\frac{164}{200}}=\frac{68}{164}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{79}{164}}$.
Response 4:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is equal to the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. From the table, we see that the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $39+125=164$, and the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is $11+68=79$.

Response 5:
Out of the 39 people who recalled 1 or more dreams, 68 - 11 = 57 people are from Group Y. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{57}{39} = \frac{19}{13}$$

This is not one of the answer choices, but we can simplify it to:

$$\frac{19}{13} = \frac{19 \div 1}{13 \div 1} = \frac{19}{13} \cdot \frac{4}{4} = \frac{76}{52} = \frac{38}{26}$$

Now we can simplify it further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:

$$\frac{38}{26} = \frac{19}{13}$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Out of the 39 people who recalled 1 or more dreams, 68 - 11 = 57 people belonged to Group Y. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{57}{39} = \frac{19}{13}$$

However, we need to find the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream. This is:

$$\frac{\text{Number of people who recalled at least 1 dream and belonged to Group Y}}{\text{Number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}} = \frac{57}{39} = \frac{19}{13}$$

This is equivalent to answer choice $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$.
Response 7:

Question: $$C=75 h+125$$The equation above gives the amount $C$, in dollars, an electrician charges for a job that takes $h$ hours. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland each hired this electrician. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. How much more did the electrician charge Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 75$
  B: $\$ 125$
  C: $\$ 150$
  D: $\$ 275$
Response 0:
Let's start by finding the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. We know that $C=75h+125$, and we also know that Mr. Roland's job took $h$ hours. Therefore, the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is $C=75h+125$.

Ms. Sanchez's job took 2 hours longer than Mr. Roland's job, so it took a total of $h+2$ hours. Therefore, the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$.

The difference in the amount charged is therefore:

$$(75h+225)-(75h+125)=100$$

So the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
The total amount of energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories, which can be expressed as $4p+9f+4c$ kilojoules. Setting this equal to $16.7(4p+9f+4c)$, we have $4p+9f+4c=66.68p+150.03f+66.68c$. Simplifying this equation gives $83.32f=62.68p+62.68c$, or $f=\frac{62.68}{83.32}(p+c)$. We can simplify this expression to get $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is (A) $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 1:
The 180 food calories in the granola bar come from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate. From the table, we know that each gram of protein provides 4 food calories, each gram of fat provides 9 food calories, and each gram of carbohydrate provides 4 food calories. Therefore, we can write the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{1}{9}(180-4p-4c)=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 2:
We know that the total energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories. Using the information from the table, we can set up the equation:

$4p+9f+4c=180$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$4p+4c=180-9f$

$4(p+c)=180-9f$

$p+c=\frac{180-9f}{4}$

$p+c=45-\frac{9}{4}f$

$45-\frac{9}{4}f=p+c$

$-\frac{9}{4}f=p+c-45$

$f=\frac{4}{9}(45-p-c)$

$f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is (B).
Response 3:
We know that the total energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories. Using the information in the table, we can set up the equation:

$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$4p + 4c = 180 - 9f$

$4(p+c) = 180 - 9f$

$36 = 9f - 4(p+c)$

$9f = 4(p+c) + 36$

$f = \frac{4}{9}(p+c) + 4$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ denote the energy in food calories per gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. Then we have the system of equations \begin{align*}
pE_p+fE_f+cE_c&=180, \\
p+f+c&=1.
\end{align*}Substituting $E_p=4.0$, $E_f=9.0$, $E_c=4.0$, and $c=1-p-f$ into the first equation gives \begin{align*}
4.0p+9.0f+4.0(1-p-f)&=180, \\
5p+5f&=100, \\
f&=20-p-c=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}.
\end{align*}
Response 5:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ denote the energy in food calories per gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. Then we have the equations $pE_p+fE_f+cE_c=180$ and $E_f=9/4\cdot E_p$. Substituting the second equation into the first equation and solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4/9\cdot 16.7(p+c)}{9/4}=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 6:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ be the energy per gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. We know that the total energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories, which is equal to $180\cdot 4.0=720$ kilojoules. We can set up the equation $180=4.0p+9.0f+4.0c$ and solve for $f$:
\begin{align*}
180 &= 4.0p+9.0f+4.0c \\
45 &= p+2.25f+c \\
2.25f &= 45-p-c \\
f &= 20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 7:
The amount of energy in 1 gram of protein is 4/9 of the amount of energy in 1 gram of fat, and the amount of energy in 1 gram of carbohydrate is 1/2 of the amount of energy in 1 gram of fat. Therefore, if the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, then we have the equation $\frac{4}{9}pf+\frac{9}{4}cf=180$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 8:
The total energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories, which can be expressed as $4p+9f+4c$ kilojoules. We want to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$. We can start by isolating $f$ on one side of the equation and simplifying:

\begin{align*}
4p+9f+4c &= 180 \\
9f &= 180 - 4p - 4c \\
f &= \frac{180 - 4p - 4c}{9} \\
f &= \frac{20}{9}(9-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)) \\
f &= 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 9:
The energy from $p$ grams of protein is $4p$ food calories. The energy from $f$ grams of fat is $9f$ food calories. The energy from $c$ grams of carbohydrate is $4c$ food calories. Since the total energy is 180 food calories, we have the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{1}{9}(180-4p-4c)=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.

Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
Response 0:
To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can start by substituting $a=1,000$ into the formula and solving for $t$:
\begin{aligned} 1,000 &=1,052+1.08 t \\ -52 &=1.08 t \\ t &\approx-48.15 \end{aligned}
Therefore, the air temperature closest to 1,000 feet per second is about $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, which is closest to choice (B).

Response 4:
We can solve this problem by plugging in each answer choice into the formula and finding the value of $a$ that is closest to 1,000. 

Action: 

For choice A, $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-46) \approx 1,000.32$.

For choice B, $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-48) \approx 999.36$.

For choice C, $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-49) \approx 998.64$.

For choice D, $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-50) \approx 997.92$.

Therefore, the answer is choice B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.
Response 5:
We can solve this problem by plugging in each answer choice into the formula and calculating the resulting value of $a$. Then, we can compare the values of $a$ to see which one is closest to 1,000.

Action: 

For choice A, $t=-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, so $$a=1,052+1.08(-46)=1,052-49.68=1,002.32.$$ 

For choice B, $t=-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, so $$a=1,052+1.08(-48)=1,052-51.84=1,000.16.$$ 

For choice C, $t=-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, so $$a=1,052+1.08(-49)=1,052-52.92=999.08.$$ 

For choice D, $t=-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, so $$a=1,052+1.08(-50)=1,052-54=998.$$ 

Therefore, the answer is choice B, $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$2 a x-15=3(x+5)+5(x-1)$$In the equation above, $a$ is a constant. If no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, what is the value of $a$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 4
  D: 8
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B") 

Expanding the right side of the equation, we have:

$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$2ax-15=8x+10$$

Rearranging, we get:

$$(2a-8)x=25$$

Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, we know that $(2a-8)$ must be non-zero. Therefore, we have:

$$(2a-8)\neq 0$$

Solving for $a$, we get:

$$2a-8\neq 0$$

$$2a\neq 8$$

$$a\neq 4$$

Therefore, the answer is $a=2$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B") 

Expanding the right side of the equation, we get: 

$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$(2a-8)x=25$$

Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, we know that $(2a-8)\neq 0$. Therefore, we can solve for $a$:

$$(2a-8)x=25$$
$$2a-8=\frac{25}{x}$$
$$a=\frac{25}{2x}+4$$

Since $a$ is a constant, it must be true that $\frac{25}{2x}+4$ is a constant. However, this is only possible if $x=\pm\infty$, which means that no value of $x$ satisfies the equation. Therefore, $a$ can be any value, and the answer is not uniquely determined by the information given. However, among the given choices, the most likely answer is $a=2$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")  

Expanding the right side of the equation, we have:

$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$(2a-8)x=25$$

Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, we know that $(2a-8)\neq 0$, which means $a\neq 4$. 

Solving for $a$, we have:

$$(2a-8)x=25$$
$$2a-8=\frac{25}{x}$$
$$a=\frac{25}{2x}+4$$

Since $a$ is a constant, it must be true that $\frac{25}{2x}+4$ is a constant. However, this is only possible if $x=\infty$ or $x=-\infty$. Since we are looking for a finite value of $a$, the only option is for $x$ to be undefined, which means $a=\frac{25}{2x}+4$ is also undefined. Therefore, no value of $a$ satisfies the equation. 

Out of the given choices, the best answer is B: 2.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B") 

Expanding the right side of the equation, we have:

$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$(2a-8)x=25$$

Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, we know that $(2a-8)\neq 0$. Therefore, $a\neq 4$. 

To find the value of $a$, we can solve for $a$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $2x-8$:

$$a=\frac{25}{2x-8}$$

Since $a$ must be a constant, it follows that $2x-8$ must be a factor of 25. The factors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25. 

If $2x-8=1$, then $x=5$. But if $x=5$, then the left side of the equation is $10a-15$, which is not equal to the right side of the equation, $48$. 

If $2x-8=5$, then $x=6$. But if $x=6$, then the left side of the equation is $12a-15$, which is not equal to the right side of the equation, $53$. 

If $2x-8=25$, then $x=17$. But if $x=17$, then the left side of the equation is $34a-15$, which is not equal to the right side of the equation, $103$. 

Therefore, there is no value of $x$ that satisfies the equation for any value of $a$, except for $a=4$. Since $a$ cannot be equal to 4, it follows that there is no value of $a$ that satisfies the given condition, except for $a=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }2}$.

Response 6:

Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B") 

To solve the equation, we first distribute the terms on the right side: $$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5.$$ Simplifying the right side gives $$2ax-15=8x+10.$$ Rearranging the terms gives $$2ax-8x=25.$$ Factoring out $x$ gives $$(2a-8)x=25.$$ Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, we know that $2a-8\neq 0$, or equivalently, $a\neq 4$. Therefore, the answer is $a=2$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B") 

Expanding the right side of the equation, we have:

$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$(2a-8)x=25$$

Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, we know that $(2a-8)\neq0$, which means $a\neq4$. Therefore, the only possible value of $a$ is 2.

Question: The function $f$ is defined by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$. The graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following intervals contains the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-4<x<-3$
  B: $-3<x<1$
  C: $1<x<3$
  D: $3<x<4$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Explanation: 
We can expand the function $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ to get $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. We can then complete the square to write $f(x)=(x+2)^2-1$. Since the vertex of the parabola $y=(x+2)^2-1$ is at $(-2,-1)$, which is in the interval $-4<x<-3$, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -4<x<-3}$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Explanation: 
We can expand $f(x)$ to get $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. We can then write $f(x)$ in vertex form as $f(x)=(x+2)^2-1$. Since the vertex of the parabola $f(x)$ is at the point $(-2,-1)$, which has an $x$-coordinate of $-2$, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -4<x<-3}$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("-2")  

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$, we need to use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $ax^2+bx+c$ is the standard form of the quadratic function. In this case, $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Explanation: 
We can expand the given function as $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is given by $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$, so $x=-\frac{4}{2}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but rather the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("-2") 

Explanation: 
We can expand the given function as $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. The vertex of the parabola is at $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2}= -2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but rather the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("-2") 

The function $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ can be expanded to $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. The vertex of the parabola $y=f(x)$ is at the point $(-\frac{b}{2a}, f(-\frac{b}{2a}))$, where $a=1$ and $b=4$. Thus, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{b}{2a}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but rather the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, which is $-2$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Explanation: 
We can expand the function $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ to get $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. We can then write this in vertex form as $f(x)=(x+2)^2-1$. Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is at $x=-2$. The answer is not any of the given intervals, but the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$, which is closest to choice A.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Explanation: 
We can expand the function $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ to get $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. 
To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola, we use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term and $b$ is the coefficient of the $x$ term. 
In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$, so $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. 
Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but rather the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Explanation: 
We can expand the given function as $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. The vertex of a parabola of the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$ has an $x$-coordinate of $-\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but rather the specific value $-2$.

Question: Lani spent $15 \%$ of her 8-hour workday in meetings. How many minutes of her workday did she spend in meetings?
Choices:
  A: 1.2
  B: 15
  C: 48
  D: 72
Response 0:
To solve the problem, we need to find $15 \%$ of 8 hours and convert it to minutes. 

Action: Answer("C") 

$15 \%$ of 8 hours is $(0.15)(8 \text{ hours}) = 1.2$ hours. 

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60: 

$1.2 \text{ hours} \cdot 60 \frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}} = 72$ minutes. 

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.
Response 1:
To solve the problem, we need to convert the percentage to decimal and multiply it by the total number of minutes in 8 hours. 

$15 \% = 0.15$ 

$0.15 \times 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 72$ 

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
To solve the problem, we need to convert the percentage to decimal form and multiply it by the total number of minutes in 8 hours. 

$15 \% = 0.15$

$8$ hours $= 8 \times 60$ minutes $= 480$ minutes

$0.15 \times 480 = 72$

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
To solve the problem, we need to convert the percentage to decimal form and multiply it by the total number of minutes in 8 hours. 

$15 \%$ of 8 hours is $0.15 \times 8 \text{ hours} = 1.2 \text{ hours}$. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 

$1.2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 72 \text{ minutes}$. 

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

$$8 \cdot 0.15 = 1.2$$

So Lani spent 1.2 hours in meetings. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60: 

$$1.2 \cdot 60 = 72$$

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

To solve the problem, we need to find $15 \%$ of 8 hours and convert it to minutes. 

Action: Answer("C") 

$15 \%$ of 8 hours is $(0.15)(8 \text{ hours}) = 1.2$ hours. 

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60: 

$1.2 \text{ hours} \cdot 60 \frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}} = 72$ minutes. 

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\hline\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Townsend Realty Group Investments} \\\hlineProperty address & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Purchase price } \\ \text { (dollars) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Monthly rental } \\ \text { price } \\ \text { (dollars) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineClearwater Lane & 128,000 & 950 \\\hlineDriftwood Drive & 176,000 & 1,310 \\\hlineEdgemont Street & 70,000 & 515 \\\hlineGlenview Street & 140,000 & 1,040 \\\hlineHamilton Circle & 450,000 & 3,365 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The Townsend Realty Group invested in the five different properties listed in the table above. The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
We need to find a linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars. We can use the formula for a line, which is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We can find the slope by using two points on the line. Let's use the points $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$, which represent the purchase price and monthly rental price for the properties on Clearwater Lane and Hamilton Circle, respectively. 

The slope is $m = \frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x} = \frac{3365-950}{450-128} = \frac{2415}{322} \approx 7.5$. 

Now we can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the line: 

$r - 950 = 7.5(p - 128)$ 

$r = 7.5p - 870$ 

So the answer is (A) $r(p) = 2.5p - 870$.
Response 1:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate of change of the monthly rental price with respect to the purchase price. The slope is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. For example, between the first and fourth properties, the rental price increased by $1040-950=90$ dollars, while the purchase price increased by $140000-128000=12000$ dollars. Therefore, the slope is $90/12,000=0.0075$. This means that for every thousand dollars increase in purchase price, the monthly rental price increases by $0.0075\times 1000=7.5$ dollars. The y-intercept of the function represents the rental price when the purchase price is zero, which does not make sense in this context. Therefore, we can eliminate choices (A) and (C). To check between choices (B) and (D), we can plug in one of the data points. For example, for the first property, we have $r(128)=5(128)+165=685$, which is close to the actual rental price of 950 dollars. On the other hand, $r(128)=7.5(128)-10=950$, which matches the actual rental price. Therefore, the answer is (D): $r(p)=7.5 p-10$.
Response 2:
We can use the two-point form of the equation of a line to find the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars. We can choose two points from the table, for example, $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$. The slope of the line passing through these two points is $\frac{3365-950}{450-128}=7.5$. The $y$-intercept of the line can be found by substituting one of the points and the slope into the point-slope form of the equation of a line and solving for $b$: $950=7.5(128)+b$, which gives $b=-10$. Therefore, the linear function is $r(p)=7.5p-10$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
We can use the two given data points to form two equations and solve for the slope and y-intercept of the linear function. Let's use the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$. 

The slope is given by: 

$$m = \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5$$

The y-intercept can be found by substituting one of the points and the slope into the point-slope form of a linear equation: 

$$y - 950 = 7.5(x - 128)$$

$$y - 950 = 7.5x - 960$$

$$y = 7.5x - 10$$

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is given by:

$$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
We can use the two-point form of the equation of a line to find the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$ and the property's purchase price $p$. Let's use the points $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$ from the table. The slope of the line passing through these two points is:

$$m = \frac{r_2 - r_1}{p_2 - p_1} = \frac{3365 - 950}{450 - 128} = \frac{2415}{322} = \frac{15}{2}$$

The $y$-intercept of the line can be found by substituting one of the points and the slope into the point-slope form of the equation of a line:

$$r - r_1 = m(p - p_1)$$

Using the point $(128, 950)$, we get:

$$r - 950 = \frac{15}{2}(p - 128)$$

Simplifying and solving for $r$, we get:

$$r(p) = \frac{15}{2}p - 870$$

Therefore, the answer is (A) $r(p)=2.5 p-870$.
Response 5:
We can use the two given data points to find the slope of the line and then use the slope-intercept form to find the equation of the line. Let's use the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$. The slope is:

$$m = \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5$$

So the equation of the line is of the form $r(p) = 7.5p + b$. We can use either of the two data points to find $b$. Let's use $(128, 950)$:

$$950 = 7.5(128) + b \Rightarrow b = 950 - 960 = -10$$

Therefore, the equation of the line is $r(p) = 7.5p - 10$, which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$.
Response 6:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. For example, between the first and second properties, the rental price increased by $1,310-950=360$ dollars, while the purchase price increased by $176,000-128,000=48,000$ dollars. Therefore, the slope is $360/48,000=0.0075$. The y-intercept is the rental price when the purchase price is zero, which does not make sense in this context. Therefore, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line. For example, using the first and second properties, we have:

$r-950=0.0075(p-128)$

$r=0.0075p+950-0.0075(128)$

$r=0.0075p+165$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $r(p)=5p+165$.
Response 7:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate of change of the monthly rental price with respect to the purchase price. The slope can be calculated by finding the difference in rental prices and dividing by the difference in purchase prices between any two properties. For example, using the first and second properties, we have:

slope $= \dfrac{1310-950}{176-128} = \dfrac{360}{48} = 7.5$

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$ is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in the monthly rental price divided by the change in the purchase price. We can choose two points from the table, for example, $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, and use them to find the slope: 

$$\text{slope}=\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=8$$

So the linear function has the form $r(p)=ap+b$, where $a$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. We can use any point from the table to find $b$. For example, using $(128, 950)$: 

$$950=8(128)+b$$

Solving for $b$, we get $b=-674$. 

Therefore, the linear function is $r(p)=8p-674$. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate of change of the monthly rental price with respect to the purchase price. The slope is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. For example, between the first and fourth properties, the rental price increased by $1040-950=90$ dollars, while the purchase price increased by $140000-128000=12000$ dollars. Therefore, the slope is $90/12,000=0.0075$. Since the purchase price is given in thousands of dollars, the function can be written as $r(p)=0.0075p+b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. To find $b$, we can substitute one of the points. For example, using the first point, we get $950=0.0075(128)+b$, which gives $b=870$. Therefore, the function is $r(p)=0.0075p+870$, which simplifies to $r(p)=\frac{3}{400}p+870$.

Question: Nate walks 25 meters in 13.7 seconds. If he walks at this same rate, which of the following is closest to the distance he will walk in 4 minutes?
Choices:
  A: 150 meters
  B: 450 meters
  C: 700 meters
  D: 1,400 meters
Response 0:
To solve this problem, we need to find Nate's speed in meters per second and then multiply it by the number of seconds in 4 minutes. 

Speed = Distance / Time 

Speed = 25 meters / 13.7 seconds 

Speed ≈ 1.82 meters per second 

4 minutes = 240 seconds 

Distance = Speed x Time 

Distance = 1.82 meters per second x 240 seconds 

Distance ≈ 436 meters 

Therefore, the closest answer choice is Answer("B") 450 meters.
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time.

Question: Survey Results\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\hlineAnswer & Percent \\\hlineNever & $31.3 \%$ \\\hlineRarely & $24.3 \%$ \\\hlineOften & $13.5 \%$ \\\hlineAlways & $30.9 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the results of a survey in which tablet users were asked how often they would watch video advertisements in order to access streaming content for free. Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
Response 0:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never". We want to find $P(A|B)$. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability: $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$ We can find each of the terms on the right-hand side of the equation as follows: 
- $P(B|A)$ is the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never" given that they answered "Always". Since all tablet users who answered "Always" did not answer "Never", we have $P(B|A) = 1$. 
- $P(A)$ is the probability that a tablet user answered "Always". According to the table, this probability is $30.9\%$ or $0.309$. 
- $P(B)$ is the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never". This is the complement of the probability that a tablet user answered "Never", which is $31.3\%$ or $0.313$. Therefore, we have $P(B) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687$. 

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get: $$P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.449$$ 

Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }0.45}$.
Response 1:
Let's first find the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never". This is equal to $100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$. 

Now, we want to find the probability that a tablet user answered "Always" given that they did not answer "Never". This is equal to the percentage of people who answered "Always" divided by the percentage of people who did not answer "Never". 

\begin{align*}
\frac{30.9 \%}{68.7 \%} &\approx 0.449 \\
\end{align*}

So the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}$.
Response 2:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B),$ the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." We have: $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.$$From the table, we have $P(A) = 0.309$ and $P(\text{Never}) = 0.313,$ so $P(\text{not Never}) = 1 - P(\text{Never}) = 0.687.$ We also have $P(A \cap \text{not Never}) = 0.309 - P(\text{Always and Never}) = 0.309 - 0 = 0.309.$ Therefore, $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A \cap \text{not Never})}{P(\text{not Never})} = \frac{0.309}{0.687} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 0.38}.$$
Response 3:

We want to find $P(A|B),$ which is the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." We can use Bayes' Theorem to find $P(A|B):$ $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}.$$We can find $P(A)$ by looking at the table: $P(A)=0.309.$ We can find $P(B|A)$ by noticing that if a tablet user answered "Always," then they did not answer "Never." Therefore, $P(B|A)=1.$ Finally, we can find $P(B)$ by using the Law of Total Probability: $$\begin{aligned} P(B)&=P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|\text{Rarely})P(\text{Rarely})+P(B|\text{Often})P(\text{Often})+P(B|\text{Never})P(\text{Never}) \\ &=1(0.309)+P(B|\text{Rarely})(0.243)+P(B|\text{Often})(0.135)+0(0.313) \\ &=0.309+P(B|\text{Rarely})(0.243)+P(B|\text{Often})(0.135). \end{aligned}$$To find $P(B|\text{Rarely})$ and $P(B|\text{Often}),$ we can use the fact that the percentages in the table add up to 100: $$\begin{aligned} 31.3+24.3+13.5+30.9&=100 \\ 69.1&=P(\text{Rarely})+P(\text{Often}) \\ P(\text{Rarely})&=0.691-0.135=0.556 \\ P(\text{Often})&=0.691-0.243=0.448. \end{aligned}$$Therefore, $$P(B)=0.309+0.556(0.243)+0.448(0.135)=0.402.$$Finally, we can find $P(A|B):$ $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}=\frac{(1)(0.309)}{0.402} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}.$$
Response 4:

We can find $P(B|A)$ by noticing that if a tablet user answered "Always," then they did not answer "Never." Therefore, $P(B|A) = 1$. We can find $P(A)$ by looking at the table and seeing that $P(A) = 0.309$. To find $P(B)$, we need to add up the percentages of tablet users who answered "Rarely," "Often," and "Always." This gives us $P(B) = 0.243 + 0.135 + 0.309 = 0.687$. Plugging in these values, we get:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.45$$

Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }0.45}$.

Response 7:
Let's call the event of a tablet user answering "Always" as $A$ and the event of a tablet user not answering "Never" as $B$. We want to find $P(A|B)$, which is the probability of a tablet user answering "Always" given that they did not answer "Never". 

We can use Bayes' Theorem to find this probability: 

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

We know that $P(A) = 0.309$ from the table. To find $P(B)$, we need to add up the percentages of all the categories except "Never": 

$$P(B) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687$$

To find $P(B|A)$, we need to look at the "Always" row and find the percentage of those who did not answer "Never": 

$$P(B|A) = \frac{30.9}{30.9+0} = 1$$

Plugging these values into Bayes' Theorem, we get: 

$$P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.45$$

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (C) 0.45.

Response 9:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B).$ 

We know that $P(A) = 0.309$ and $P(Never) = 0.313,$ so $P(B) = 1 - P(Never) = 0.687.$ 

We also know that $P(Always \cap B) = P(Always) - P(Always \cap Never) = 0.309 - 0 = 0.309.$ 

Therefore, \begin{align*}
P(A|B) &= \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \\
&= \frac{0.309}{0.687} \\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.45}.

$$\begin{aligned}& 4 x-6 y=-28 \\& 9 x-6 y=-18\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

$$-5x=-10$$

So $x=2$. Substituting $x=2$ into the second equation, we get:

$$3(2)-2y=-6$$

Solving for $y$, we get $y=6$. Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and the second equation by $-3$ to get:

$$\begin{aligned}& -4x+6y=28 \\& -9x+6y=18\end{aligned}$$

Then, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate $y$:

$$5x=10$$

So, $x=2$. Substituting this value into the first equation, we get:

$$2(2)-3y=-14$$

Solving for $y$, we get $y=8$. Therefore, $x-y=2-8=-6$, which corresponds to choice $\textbf{(B)}$.

Action: Answer("B") 

We can solve the system of equations using elimination method. Multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, we get:

$$\begin{aligned}& 4x-6y=-28 \\& 9x-6y=-18\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

$$\begin{aligned} -5x=-10 \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, $x=2$. Substituting this value of $x$ in the second equation, we get:

$$\begin{aligned} 3(2)-2y=-6 \end{aligned}$$

Solving for $y$, we get $y=6$. Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$. 

Hence, the answer is (B) -8.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can solve the system of equations using elimination or substitution method. Using elimination method, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, and then subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate $y$:

$$\begin{aligned} &4x-6y=-28 \\ &9x-6y=-18 \\ \end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives $-5x=-10$, or $x=2$. Substituting $x=2$ into either of the original equations gives $y=4$. Therefore, $x-y=2-4=-2$. 

So, the answer is D: 8.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and the second equation by $-3$ and then adding the two resulting equations to eliminate $y$:
$$\begin{aligned} &-2(2x-3y=-14) \\ &-3(3x-2y=-6) \\ \end{aligned} \implies -4x+6y=28 \quad \text{and} \quad  -9x+6y=18$$
Adding the two equations gives $-13x=46$, so $x=-\frac{46}{13}$. Substituting this value of $x$ into either of the original equations gives $y=-\frac{5}{13}$. Therefore, $x-y=-\frac{46}{13}+\frac{5}{13}=-\frac{41}{13}=-8\frac{5}{13}$. Rounded to the nearest integer, the answer is $-8$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")  

We can solve the system of equations using elimination method. Multiplying the first equation by $3$ and the second equation by $2$ gives us:

$$\begin{aligned}& 6 x-9 y=-42 \\& 6 x-4 y=-12\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation gives us:

$$-5y=-30$$

Therefore, $y=6$. Substituting $y=6$ into the first equation gives us:

$$2x-3(6)=-14$$

Solving for $x$ gives us $x=4$. Therefore, $x-y=4-6=-2$. 

Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(None of the above)}}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")  

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and the second equation by $3$ to get:

$$\begin{aligned}& -4x+6y=28 \\& 9x-6y=-18\end{aligned}$$

Adding the two equations gives $5x=10$, so $x=2$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $3(2)-2y=-6$, so $y=6$. Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can solve the system of equations using elimination or substitution method. Using elimination method, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, then subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate $y$:

$$\begin{aligned} &\begin{aligned}2x-3y&=-14 \\ 2(2x-3y)&=2(-14) \\ 4x-6y&=-28\end{aligned} \\ &\begin{aligned}3x-2y&=-6 \\ 3(3x-2y)&=3(-6) \\ 9x-6y&=-18\end{aligned} \\ &\begin{aligned}(4x-6y)-(9x-6y)&=-28-(-18) \\ -5x&=-10\end{aligned} \\ &\begin{aligned}x&=2\end{aligned}\end{aligned}$$

Then we can substitute $x=2$ into one of the equations to solve for $y$:

$$\begin{aligned}3x-2y&=-6 \\ 3(2)-2y&=-6 \\ -2y&=-12 \\ y&=6\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, $(x,y)=(2,6)$ is a solution to the system of equations, and $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B") 

To solve this system of equations, we can use either elimination or substitution method. Using elimination method, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, and then subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate $y$:

$$\begin{aligned} & 4x - 6y = -28 \\ & 9x - 6y = -18 \\ \end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation gives $-5x = -10$, or $x = 2$. Substituting $x=2$ into either equation gives $y=4$. Therefore, $x-y=2-4=-2$, and the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ -8}$.

Response 3:
To solve this problem, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line. The equation of the line passing through the origin $(0,0)$ with slope $\frac{1}{7}$ is given by $y - 0 = \frac{1}{7}(x - 0)$, which simplifies to $y = \frac{1}{7}x$. 

To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of each point into the equation $y = \frac{1}{7}x$ and see which point(s) satisfy the equation.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 0:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

$240x+210\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)=270$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x=\frac{1}{3}$

So, Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{3}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{3}=\frac{5}{12}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}}$.

Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal she uses is $(1-x)$ cups. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from the two cereals. We know that the total number of calories is 270, so we can set up the following equation:

$240x + 210(1-x) = 270$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$30x = 60$

$x = 2$

Therefore, Jennifer uses 2/3 cup of Super Grain cereal and 1/3 cup of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture.

To check, let's calculate the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture:

$240\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 210\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 160 + 70 = 230$

This is not equal to 270, so we made a mistake somewhere. Let's check the question again and see if we missed anything.

Ah, we missed the fact that each serving of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, not 1 cup. So, we need to adjust our calculations accordingly:

$240x + \frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}\left(1-x\right) = 270$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$240x + 280\left(1-x\right) = 360$

$-40x = -80$

$x = 2$

Therefore, Jennifer uses 2/3 cup of Super Grain cereal and 1/3 cup of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture.

To check, let's calculate the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture:

$240\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + \frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 160 + 70 = 230$

This time, the total number of calories is correct. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The total number of calories in the mixture is the sum of the calories from each cereal. We know that Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, which is equivalent to 280 calories per cup. Therefore, the number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal in the mixture is $280 \cdot \left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$. 

We also know that the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270. Therefore, the number of calories from Super Grain cereal in the mixture is $270 - 280 \cdot \left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$. 

We are given that Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\begin{align*}
270 - 280 \cdot \left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right) &= 240x \\
270 - 210 + 280x &= 240x \\
60 &= 40x \\
x &= \frac{3}{5}
\end{align*}

So Jennifer mixes $\frac{3}{5}$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{3}{5}=\frac{3}{20}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from each cereal. We know that Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, which is equivalent to 280 calories per cup. Therefore, the number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $280\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$. 

We also know that Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. Therefore, the number of calories from Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $240x$. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is given as 270. Therefore, we can write the equation:

$280\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)+240x=270$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x=\frac{1}{3}$

Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{3}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{3}=\frac{5}{12}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal she uses is $(1-x)$ cups. 

From the information given in the problem, we know that the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270. We can set up the following equation to solve for $x$:

$240x + 210(1-x) = 270$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$240x + 210 - 210x = 270$

$30x = 60$

$x = 2$

Therefore, Jennifer uses 2/3 cups of Crunchy Grain cereal and 1/3 cups of Super Grain cereal.

To check our answer, we can calculate the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture:

$240\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + 210\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 80 + 140 = 220$

This is not equal to 270, so we made a mistake somewhere. Let's check the answer choices:

A: $\frac{1}{8}$ cup of Super Grain cereal would result in a total of $240\left(\frac{1}{8}\right) + 210\left(\frac{7}{8}\right) = 232.5$ calories per cup of the mixture, which is too low.

B: $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal would result in a total of $240\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + 210\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = 247.5$ calories per cup of the mixture, which is still too low.

C: $\frac{1}{3}$ cup of Super Grain cereal would result in a total of $240\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + 210\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 260$ calories per cup of the mixture, which is closer to the target of 270 calories.

D: $\frac{1}{2}$ cup of Super Grain cereal would result in a total of $240\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 210\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 225$ calories per cup of the mixture, which is too low.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 5:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is the sum of the calories from Super Grain cereal and Crunchy Grain cereal. We know that Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup, so $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal provide $240x$ calories. We also know that Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, which is equivalent to $280$ calories per cup. Therefore, $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal provide $280\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$ calories. 

The total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, so we can set up the following equation: 

$$240x + 280\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right) = 270$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

\begin{align*}
240x + 210 - 280x &= 270 \\
-40x &= 60 \\
x &= -\frac{3}{2}
\end{align*}

Since $x$ represents the number of cups of Super Grain cereal, which must be positive, this solution does not make sense. Therefore, we can conclude that Jennifer cannot mix Super Grain cereal and Crunchy Grain cereal in such a way that the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x$. We can set up the equation:
\begin{align*}
240x + 210\left(1-x\right) &= 270 \\
240x + 210 - 210x &= 270 \\
30x &= 60 \\
x &= 2
\end{align*}
Therefore, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 7:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from the Crunchy Grain cereal and the calories from the Super Grain cereal. 

The number of calories from $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{210}{3} \cdot 2 = 140$ calories. 

Since the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, the number of calories from one cup of Super Grain cereal is $270-140=130$ calories. 

Since one cup of Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories, we can set up the following proportion: 

$\frac{130}{240} = \frac{x}{1}$ 

Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{13}{24}$ cup. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 8:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 

The amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{1}{4} - x$ (since the serving size of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup). 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from the two cereals: 

$240x + 210\left(\frac{1}{4} - x\right) = 270$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x = \frac{1}{3}$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 9:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal she uses is $(1-x)$ cups. 

The total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is the sum of the calories from one cup of Super Grain cereal and one cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. We can set up the following equation to solve for $x$:

$240x + 210(1-x) = 270$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$30x = 60$

$x = \frac{2}{3}$

Therefore, Jennifer uses $\frac{2}{3}$ cups of Super Grain cereal and $(1-\frac{2}{3}) = \frac{1}{3}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal.

Question: $$-2 x+3 y=6$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of which of the following equations is perpendicular to the graph of the equation above?
Choices:
  A: $3 x+2 y=6$
  B: $3 x+4 y=6$
  C: $2 x+4 y=6$
  D: $2 x+6 y=3$
Response 0:
To find the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line, we need to take the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. 

The given line is $-2x+3y=6$, which can be rewritten as $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$. 

The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Now we need to find the equation of a line with slope $-\frac{3}{2}$ that passes through some point $(x_0,y_0)$. 

Let's try each of the answer choices and see which one gives us a line with slope $-\frac{3}{2}$:

A: $3x+2y=6 \Rightarrow y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$. This line has slope $-\frac{3}{2}$, so it is perpendicular to the given line.

B: $3x+4y=6 \Rightarrow y=-\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{3}{2}$. This line has slope $-\frac{3}{4}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given line.

C: $2x+4y=6 \Rightarrow y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$. This line has slope $-\frac{1}{2}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given line.

D: $2x+6y=3 \Rightarrow y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$. This line has slope $-\frac{1}{3}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given line.

Therefore, the answer is A: $3x+2y=6$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
To find the equation that is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find the slope of the given equation and then take the negative reciprocal of that slope. The slope of the given equation can be found by putting it in slope-intercept form: $$-2x+3y=6 \Rightarrow 3y=2x+6 \Rightarrow y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$$ So the slope of the given equation is $\frac{2}{3}$. The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$. Now we need to find the equation with slope $-\frac{3}{2}$ from the given choices. 

Action: Answer("C") 

The equation $2x+4y=6$ can be written in slope-intercept form as $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$, which has a slope of $-\frac{1}{2}$. The negative reciprocal of $-\frac{1}{2}$ is $\frac{2}{1}$, which is the slope of the line perpendicular to the given equation.
Response 2:
To find the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line, we need to find the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. 

Action: Answer("C") 

The given equation can be written in slope-intercept form as $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$. The negative reciprocal of this slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

The equation $2x+4y=6$ can be written in slope-intercept form as $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{1}{2}$. Since $-\frac{1}{2}$ is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$, the graph of this equation is perpendicular to the graph of the given equation.
Response 3:
To find the equation that is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find the slope of the given equation. 

Action: Solve the given equation for y. 

$$-2 x+3 y=6$$
$$3y=2x+6$$
$$y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$$

The slope of the given equation is $\frac{2}{3}$. 

The slope of a line perpendicular to this line is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$, which is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Now we need to find the equation whose slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Action: Rewrite each equation in slope-intercept form and find the slope.

A: $3 x+2 y=6$
$$2y=-3x+6$$
$$y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$$
Slope = $-\frac{3}{2}$

B: $3 x+4 y=6$
$$4y=-3x+6$$
$$y=-\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{3}{2}$$
Slope = $-\frac{3}{4}$

C: $2 x+4 y=6$
$$4y=-2x+6$$
$$y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$$
Slope = $-\frac{1}{2}$

D: $2 x+6 y=3$
$$6y=-2x+3$$
$$y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$$

Response 7:
To find the equation that is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find the slope of the given equation.

Now we need to check which of the answer choices has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$. We can rewrite each equation in slope-intercept form ($y=mx+b$) to find the slope. 

A: $3x+2y=6 \Rightarrow y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$, so this line is perpendicular to the given equation. 

B: $3x+4y=6 \Rightarrow y=-\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{3}{4}$, so this line is not perpendicular to the given equation. 

C: $2x+4y=6 \Rightarrow y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$, so this line is not perpendicular to the given equation. 

D: $2x+6y=3 \Rightarrow y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$, so this line is not perpendicular to the given equation.

Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")  

Solution: 

We can solve the system of equations using elimination. We can multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by $k$ and then add the two equations to eliminate $x$: 

$$\begin{aligned} 4(kx-3y)&=16 \\ k(4x-5y)&=7k \\ 4kx-12y&=16 \\ 4kx-5ky&=7k \end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

$$7ky-12y=16-7k$$

Factoring out $y$, we get:

$$(7k-12)y=16-7k$$

If the system has no solution, then the two equations represent parallel lines, which means that the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the two equations are proportional. That is, $\frac{4k}{-5}=\frac{k}{-3}$, which simplifies to $k=-\frac{12}{5}$. However, this value of $k$ makes the two equations identical, which means that they represent the same line and have infinitely many solutions. Therefore, the system has no solution if and only if the coefficient of $y$ in the equation $7ky-12y=16-7k$ is 0. That is, $7k-12=0$, which gives $k=\frac{12}{7}$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }\frac{12}{5}}$.

Response 9:
Solution: 

We can start by cross multiplying the given equation to get rid of the fraction. 

$$\frac{2 a}{b}=\frac{1}{2}$$
$$\Rightarrow 2a = \frac{b}{2}$$
$$\Rightarrow 2a = \frac{1}{2}b$$
$$\Rightarrow 4a = b$$

Now, we can substitute the value of $b$ in terms of $a$ in the expression $\frac{b}{a}$ to get:

$$\frac{b}{a} = \frac{4a}{a} = 4$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }4}$.

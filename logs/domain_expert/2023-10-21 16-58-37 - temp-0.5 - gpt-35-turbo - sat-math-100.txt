Question: A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 10,800$
  B: $\$ 16,200$
  C: $\$ 21,600$
  D: $\$ 29,700$
Response 0:
Solution: 

Since the equipment depreciates at a constant rate, we can model its value $V$ (in dollars) as a linear function of time $t$ (in years) with an initial value of $V_0 = 32,400$ and a final value of $V_f = 0$ after 12 years. That is,

$$V(t) = V_0 - \frac{V_0 - V_f}{12} t = 32,400 - \frac{32,400 - 0}{12} t = 32,400 - 2,700t.$$

After 4 years, the value of the equipment is

$$V(4) = 32,400 - 2,700 \cdot 4 = 21,600.$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$21,600}$.
Response 1:
The equipment depreciates at a constant rate for 12 years, so the depreciation per year is $\frac{\$32,400}{12}= \$2,700$. After 4 years, the equipment has depreciated by $4\times \$2,700 = \$10,800$. The current value of the equipment is therefore $ \$32,400 - \$10,800 = \$21,600$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Solution: 

Since the equipment depreciates at a constant rate for 12 years, we can model its value using a linear function. Let $V(t)$ be the value of the equipment $t$ years after it is purchased. Then we know that $V(0) = 32,400$ and $V(12) = 0$. 

The slope of the line passing through $(0, 32,400)$ and $(12, 0)$ is:

$$
m = \frac{0 - 32,400}{12 - 0} = -2,700
$$

So the equation of the line is:

$$
V(t) = -2,700t + 32,400
$$

To find the value of the equipment 4 years after it is purchased, we can evaluate $V(4)$:

$$
V(4) = -2,700 \cdot 4 + 32,400 = 20,400
$$

Therefore, the camera equipment is worth $\$ 20,400$ 4 years after it is purchased.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Solution: 

The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, which means that its value decreases linearly over time. 

Let $V(t)$ be the value of the equipment $t$ years after it is purchased. Then, we know that $V(0) = 32,400$ and $V(12) = 0$. 

Since the value decreases linearly over time, we can model $V(t)$ with a linear equation: 

$$V(t) = mt + b$$

where $m$ is the slope (rate of depreciation) and $b$ is the initial value (value at $t=0$). 

To find $m$, we use the two points $(0, 32,400)$ and $(12, 0)$: 

$$m = \frac{0 - 32,400}{12 - 0} = -2,700$$

To find $b$, we can use the point-slope form of a line: 

$$V(t) - V(0) = m(t - 0)$$

Substituting $m$ and $V(0)$, we get: 

$$V(t) - 32,400 = -2,700t$$

Solving for $V(t)$, we get: 

$$V(t) = -2,700t + 32,400$$

To find the value of the equipment 4 years after it is purchased, we plug in $t=4$: 

$$V(4) = -2,700(4) + 32,400 = 21,600$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$21,600}$.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cylindrical can containing pieces of fruit is filled to the top with syrup before being sealed. The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. If $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, which of the following is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can?
Choices:
  A: $7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  B: $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  C: $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  D: $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 0:
Let's start by finding the volume of the can. We know that the base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius of the base is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Thus, the volume of the can is $\pi r^2 h \approx 568.26 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

We also know that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. Since the syrup fills the empty spaces between the fruit, the total volume of the contents of the can (fruit + syrup) is equal to the volume of the can. Thus, the total volume of the fruit is approximately $568.26 - 110 \approx 458.26 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Therefore, the closest answer choice to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 1:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylindrical can using the given information. We know that the base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius of the base is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. The volume of the can is then $\pi r^2 h \approx 546.14 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

We also know that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. Since the syrup fills the entire space between the fruit pieces, the volume of the fruit pieces is equal to the total volume of the can minus the volume of the syrup, which is approximately $436.14 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Therefore, the closest answer choice to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 2:
We can start by finding the volume of the can using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V_{\text{can}} = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base of the can, $h$ is the height of the can, and $\pi \approx 3.14$ is a mathematical constant. Since the base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, its radius is $r = \sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $V_{\text{can}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi \cdot (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 \cdot (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is $V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{can}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 482 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

However, we need to be careful with the answer choices, which are given in $\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ rather than $\mathrm{~m}^{3}$. The answer choices are all much smaller than the volume we just calculated, which suggests that we need to convert cubic meters to cubic centimeters. Since $1 \mathrm{~m} = 100 \mathrm{~cm}$, we have $1 \mathrm{~m}^{3} = (100 \mathrm{~cm})^3 = 1,000,000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C") $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 3:
Let's begin by finding the volume of the can using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $V = \pi r^2 h = \pi (4.33)^2 (10) \approx 592.78 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the pieces of fruit is $V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{can}} - V_{\text{syrup}} \approx 482.78 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

However, we need to be careful here because the pieces of fruit do not fill the entire volume of the can. We can assume that the fruit is packed tightly together and that there are no gaps between the pieces, but there will still be some empty space between the pieces. Therefore, the actual volume of the fruit will be less than $V_{\text{fruit}}$.

Since the answer choices are in cubic centimeters, we can simply choose the closest answer to $V_{\text{fruit}}$. The closest answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 4:
We can start by finding the volume of the can using the given measurements. The volume of a cylinder is given by $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius must be $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is approximately $V_{\text{can}} \approx \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 594.5 \mathrm{~cm}^3$. 

We are also told that it takes $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup to fill the can to the top. This means that the volume of the fruit plus any empty space in the can must be $V_{\text{can}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 484.5 \mathrm{~cm}^3$. 

Finally, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder again to find the volume of the fruit. The height of the fruit is the same as the height of the can, so we just need to find the radius of the fruit. Let's assume that the fruit is packed tightly together and there are no gaps between the pieces. Then the radius of the fruit will be the same as the radius of the base. If we let $V_{\text{fruit}}$ be the volume of the fruit, we have:

$$V_{\text{fruit}} = \pi r^2 h_{\text{fruit}}$$

We know that $h_{\text{fruit}} + 10 \mathrm{~cm} = V_{\text{can}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, so $h_{\text{fruit}} = 484.5 \mathrm{~cm}^3 - 10 \mathrm{~cm} - h_{\text{syrup}}}$. Substituting this into the formula for the volume of the fruit, we get:

$$V_{\text{fruit}} = \pi r^2 (484.5 \mathrm{~cm}^3 - 10 \mathrm{~cm} - h_{\text{syrup}})$$

We don't know the exact value of $h_{\text{syrup}}$, but we do know that it must be less than or equal to 10 cm (since the syrup fills the rest of the can). Therefore, the maximum value of $V_{\text{fruit}}$ occurs when $h_{\text{syrup}} = 0$ (i.e. the can is completely full of fruit), and the minimum value occurs when $h_{\text{syrup}} = 10 \mathrm{~cm}$ (i.e. the can is completely full of syrup). 

When $h_{\text{syrup}} = 0$, we have:

$$V_{\text{fruit}} = \pi r^2 (484.5 \mathrm{~cm}^3 - 10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 185 \mathrm{~cm}^3$$

When $h_{\text{syrup}} = 10 \mathrm{~cm}$, we have:

$$V_{\text{fruit}} = \pi r^2 (484.5 \mathrm{~cm}^3) \approx 640 \mathrm{~cm}^3$$

Therefore, the closest answer choice to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is (B) $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Let the radius of the cylinder be $r$. The volume of the syrup is equal to the volume of the cylinder, which is $\pi r^{2}h = 750\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, where $h=10\mathrm{~cm}$. Solving for $r$, we get $r=5\mathrm{~cm}$. The volume of the fruit is equal to the volume of the cylinder minus the volume of the syrup, which is $\pi r^{2}h - 110\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Substituting $r=5\mathrm{~cm}$ and $h=10\mathrm{~cm}$, we get $V_{fruit} = 640\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let the radius of the cylinder be $r$. Then we have the equation $\pi r^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) = 110 \mathrm{~cm}^3$, which simplifies to $r^2 = \frac{11}{3\pi}$. 

The volume of the fruit in the can is given by $\text{Volume of cylinder} - \text{Volume of syrup} = \pi r^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^3$. Substituting $r^2 = \frac{11}{3\pi}$, we get $\text{Volume of fruit} = \frac{1100}{3} - 110 \approx 185 \mathrm{~cm}^3$. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Let $r$ be the radius of the can. We know that the volume of the syrup is $\pi r^2 h = 110$. We can solve for $r$ to get $r^2 = \frac{110}{10\pi} = \frac{11}{\pi}$. The volume of the can is then $\pi r^2 h = 75\pi$. The volume of the fruit is the difference between the volume of the can and the volume of the syrup, which is $75\pi - 110$. To find the answer closest to this value, we can estimate $\pi \approx 3.14$ and calculate $75\cdot 3.14 - 110 \approx 136$. Therefore, the answer is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 8:
We can start by finding the volume of the cylinder using the given base area and height: 

$V_{\text{cylinder}} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 75\mathrm{~cm}^2 \times 10\mathrm{~cm} = 750\mathrm{~cm}^3$

However, this volume includes the volume of the fruit as well as the syrup. We only know the total volume of the syrup, which is $110\mathrm{~cm}^3$. 

Let's assume that the fruit takes up some volume $V_{\text{fruit}}$ within the cylinder. Then the remaining volume must be the volume of the syrup: 

$V_{\text{syrup}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} - V_{\text{fruit}}$

We can rearrange this equation to solve for $V_{\text{fruit}}$: 

$V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} - V_{\text{syrup}} = 750\mathrm{~cm}^3 - 110\mathrm{~cm}^3 = 640\mathrm{~cm}^3$

Therefore, the volume of the fruit is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }640\mathrm{~cm}^3}$.
Response 9:
Let the volume of the fruit be $V$. Then the total volume of the contents of the can is $V + 110$. The volume of a cylinder is given by $\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. We are given that $h = 10$ and $r^2 = \frac{75}{\pi}$, so the volume of the can is $\pi r^2 h = 750$. Since the can is filled to the top with syrup, we have $V + 110 = 750$, so $V = 640$.

Topic: Math
Question: If $2 w+4 t=14$ and $4 w+5 t=25$, what is the value of $2 w+3 t ?$
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 10
  C: 13
  D: 17
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve this problem by using elimination method. If we multiply the first equation by $-2$ and add it to the second equation, we get $-7t=-3$, which implies $t=\frac{3}{7}$. Substituting this value of $t$ in the first equation, we get $w=\frac{5}{7}$. Finally, substituting the values of $w$ and $t$ in $2w+3t$, we get $2\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)+3\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)=\frac{13}{7}$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }13}$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation to eliminate $w.$ Then, we can solve for $t$ and substitute back into the first equation to find $w.$

Multiplying the first equation by $-2$ gives $-4w-8t=-28,$ and adding that to the second equation gives $4w+5t-4w-8t=25-28,$ which simplifies to $-3t=-3.$ Thus, $t=1.$ Substituting $t=1$ into the first equation gives $2w+4=14,$ so $w=5.$ Finally, substituting $w=5$ and $t=1$ into $2w+3t$ gives $2(5)+3(1)=\boxed{13}.$
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve the given system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $2$ and subtracting it from the second equation to get $w+t=3$. Substituting this value of $w+t$ in the first equation we get $2w+3t=5$. Therefore, the value of $2w+3t$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 13}$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation to eliminate $w.$ This gives us $-7t=-3,$ or $t=\frac{3}{7}.$ Substituting this value back into the first equation, we find $w=\frac{5}{7}.$ Finally, we can compute $2w+3t=2\cdot\frac{5}{7}+3\cdot\frac{3}{7}=\frac{13}{7}.$
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation to eliminate $w$: 

$(4w+5t) - 2(2w+4t) = 25 - 28 \Rightarrow w - 3t = -3$

Then, we can substitute $w$ in the first equation to get:

$2(-3t+14) + 4t = 8t+8 = 2(4t)+3t$

Therefore, $2w+3t = \boxed{13}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation:
\begin{align*}
-4w-8t&=-28\\
4w+5t&=25\\
\hline
-3t&=-3\\
t&=1
\end{align*}
Then, we can substitute $t=1$ into the first equation to solve for $w$:
\begin{align*}
2w+4t&=14\\
2w+4(1)&=14\\
2w&=10\\
w&=5
\end{align*}
Finally, we can substitute $w=5$ and $t=1$ into $2w+3t$ to get:
$$2w+3t=2(5)+3(1)=10+3=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }10}.$$
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation, which eliminates $w$ and gives us $t=3$. Substituting this value of $t$ into the first equation gives us $w=4$. Therefore, $2w+3t=2(4)+3(3)=8+9=\boxed{13}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding the two equations together. This eliminates the $2w$ term and gives us $-7t = -3$, which means $t=3$. We can then substitute this value of $t$ into either of the original equations to find that $w=2$. Finally, we can calculate $2w+3t = 2(2)+3(3) = 4+9 = 13$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this system of equations using elimination or substitution. Using substitution, we can solve for $w$ in the first equation in terms of $t$: $2w = 14 - 4t \Rightarrow w = 7 - 2t$. Substituting this expression for $w$ into the second equation gives $(4(7-2t) + 5t = 25$, which simplifies to $3t = 3 \Rightarrow t = 1$. Substituting this value of $t$ back into the expression $w=7-2t$ gives $w = 5$. Finally, we can evaluate $2w+3t$ as $2(5) + 3(1) = 13$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation to eliminate $w$. We get $-7t = -3$, so $t= \frac{3}{7}$. Substituting this value into the first equation, we get $w = \frac{5}{7}$. Therefore, $2w+3t = 2\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)+3\left(\frac{3}{7}\right) = \frac{13}{7}$, which is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 13}$.

Response 3:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can start by expanding the left side of the equation: $$5ax^3 - abx^2 + 20ax^2 - 3bx + 15x^2 + 12ax + 12 = 20x^3 - 9x^2 - 2x + 12$$ Simplifying this expression gives: $$5ax^3 + (20a - ab)x^2 + (12a + 15)x^2 - 3bx - 2x = 20x^3 - 9x^2 + 12$$ Rearranging the terms, we get: $$5ax^3 + (20a - ab)x^2 + (12a + 15)x^2 - (3b + 2)x + 12 = 20x^3 - 9x^2 + 12$$ Since this equation is true for all values of $x$, we can equate the coefficients of each power of $x$ on both sides of the equation. Equating the coefficients of $x^3$ gives $5a = 20$, or $a = 4$. Equating the coefficients of $x^2$ gives $20a - ab + 15 = -9$, or $ab = 20$. Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")  

To solve this problem, we can start by multiplying out the left-hand side of the equation: 

$$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=5ax^3- abx^2 + 20x^2 + 12ax - 3bx - 12$$ 

We can then compare this to the right-hand side of the equation: 

$$5ax^3- abx^2 + 20x^2 + 12ax - 3bx - 12 = 20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$ 

We can see that the coefficients of the $x^3$ terms match, so $5a = 20$, which means $a = 4$. 

We can also see that the constant terms match, so $-12 = 12$, which is not true. Therefore, the coefficients of the $x$ terms must also match, which gives us $12a - 3b = -2$. Substituting $a = 4$, we get $b = \frac{38}{3}$. 

Finally, we can calculate $ab$: 

$$ab = 4 \cdot \frac{38}{3} = \frac{152}{3} = 20\frac{2}{3}$$ 

Rounding to the nearest integer, we get $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 20}$.

Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
We can simplify $4z+8y$ as $4(a^2+b^2)+8ab$. Factoring out a 4, we get $4(a^2+2ab+b^2)$. We recognize that $a^2+2ab+b^2$ is the square of the sum of $a$ and $b$. Therefore, $4z+8y$ is equivalent to $(2a+2b)^2$ which is answer choice $\textbf{(B)}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
We can simplify $4z+8y$ by substituting $z=a^2+b^2$ and $y=ab$:
$$4z+8y=4(a^2+b^2)+8(ab)=4a^2+4b^2+8ab$$
Now, we can see that $4a^2+4b^2+8ab$ can be factored as $(2a+2b)^2$, so:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
We can simplify $4z+8y$ by substituting $z=a^2+b^2$ and $y=ab$ into the expression. This gives us:

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $a$ & $3 a$ & $5 a$ \\\hline$y$ & 0 & $-a$ & $-2 a$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$ are shown in the table above, where $a$ is a constant. If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $x+2 y=a$
  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
Response 0:
We can test each answer choice by plugging in the given values of $x$ and $y$ from the table and seeing if they satisfy the equation. 

A) $x+2y=a$
When $x=a$ and $y=0$, we get $a+2(0)=a$, which is true. However, when $x=3a$ and $y=-a$, we get $3a+2(-a)=a$, which is not true. Therefore, this equation does not represent the linear relationship.

B) $x+2y=5a$
When $x=a$ and $y=0$, we get $a+2(0)=5a$, which is not true. Therefore, this equation does not represent the linear relationship.

C) $2x-y=-5a$
When $x=a$ and $y=0$, we get $2a-0=-5a$, which is not true. Therefore, this equation does not represent the linear relationship.

D) $2x-y=7a$
When $x=a$ and $y=0$, we get $2a-0=7a$, which is not true. Therefore, this equation does not represent the linear relationship.

Since none of the answer choices work, the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ cannot be represented by any of the given equations. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
To determine the relationship between $x$ and $y$, we can use the given table to find the slope of the line that passes through the given points. The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)$. Using the first and second points in the table, we get the slope $(0-(-a))/(a-0)=a/a=1$. Using the second and third points in the table, we get the slope $(-a-(-2a))/(3a-a)=-a/2a=-1/2$. Since the slope is different for the two sets of points, there is not a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
To find the relationship between $x$ and $y$, we can use the given values in the table to form equations. We can see that when $x=a$, $y=0$. This gives us the point $(a,0)$. Similarly, when $x=3a$, $y=-a$, giving us the point $(3a,-a)$. Finally, when $x=5a$, $y=-2a$, giving us the point $(5a,-2a)$. 

We can now use any two of these points to find the equation of the line passing through them. Let's use the first and second points: 

Slope $m = \frac{-a - 0}{3a - a} = -\frac{a}{2a} = -\frac{1}{2}$. 

Using point-slope form, the equation of the line is: 

$y - 0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x-a)$ 

Simplifying, we get: 

$y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{a}{2}$ 

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 

$2y = -x + a$

Adding $2a$ to both sides, we get: 

$2y + x = 3a$

Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } x+2y=5a}$.
Response 3:
We can use the given values of $x$ and $y$ to form a system of equations. For example, when $x=a$, we have $y=0$, giving us the point $(a,0)$. Similarly, when $x=3a$, we have $y=-a$, giving us the point $(3a,-a)$. Using two points, we can find the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. The slope is given by $m=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$. Thus, we have \begin{align*}
m&=\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-1, \\
b&=0-(-1\cdot a)=a.
\end{align*}Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=-x+a$, which can be rearranged as $x+y=a$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } x+2y=a}$.
Response 4:
We can use the given table to find the slope of the line connecting $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$. The slope is $\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-\frac{a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}$.

Similarly, the slope of the line connecting $(3a,-a)$ and $(5a,-2a)$ is $\frac{-2a+a}{5a-3a}=-\frac{a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}$.

Since the slopes are equal, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is linear. We can now use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation. We can use the point $(3a,-a)$ and the slope $-\frac{1}{2}$ to get:

$y-(-a)=-\frac{1}{2}(x-3a)$

Simplifying, we get:

$y=\frac{-1}{2}x+\frac{5}{2}a$

Multiplying both sides by $-2$, we get:

$-2y=x-5a$

Adding $2y$ to both sides, we get:

$x+2y=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 5a}$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 5a}$.
Response 5:
We can see that the slope of the line is $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, which is $\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-\frac{a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}$. We can also see that the line passes through the point $(3a,-a)$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $y-(-a)=-\frac{1}{2}(x-3a)$, which simplifies to $2x-y=7a$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
We can use the given table to form equations that relate $x$ and $y$. Since we are looking for a linear relationship, we want our equation to be in the form $y=mx+b$. We can use the first two rows of the table to get the equation $-a=3am+b$ or $b=-4a$. Similarly, we can use the first and third rows of the table to get the equation $-2a=5am+b$ or $b=-7a$. Thus, we have $m=\frac{b_2-b_1}{3a-0}=\frac{3a}{3a}=1$ and $b=-4a$. Plugging these values into $y=mx+b$, we get $y=x-4a$. So the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
We can use the given table to form two equations in the form of $y=mx+b$ and solve for $m$ and $b$. The first equation can be formed by using the first two rows of the table: $0=ma+b$ and $-a=3ma+b$. Solving for $m$ and $b$ gives $m=-a/3$ and $b=a$. The second equation can be formed by using the first and last rows of the table: $0=ma+b$ and $-2a=5ma+b$. Solving for $m$ and $b$ gives $m=-2a/5$ and $b=0$. Since there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we can equate the two equations: $(-a/3)x+a=(-2a/5)x+0$. Solving for $x$ gives $x=7a/5$. Substituting $x$ back into one of the equations gives $y=-2a$. Thus, the equation that represents the relationship is $2x-y=7a$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
We can use the method of finding slope from two coordinates to check which equation represents a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$. Let's take the first two rows of the table, which gives us two points $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$. The slope between these two points is: $$\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=\frac{-1}{2}$$ Now, let's check the slopes between the other pairs of points. We get: $$\begin{aligned} \frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=\frac{-1}{2} \\ \frac{-2a+0}{5a-3a}=\frac{-2}{2}= -1 \\ \end{aligned}$$ Since the slopes are not equal, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is not linear. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{None of the Above}}$.
Response 9:
We can use the given table to form two equations relating $x$ and $y$. Since we are looking for a linear relationship, we want it to be in the form $y=mx+b$ for some constants $m$ and $b$. We can find $m$ and $b$ by using the two points $(a,0)$ and $(5a,-2a)$ from the table. The slope $m$ is given by $m=\frac{0-(-2a)}{a-5a}=\frac{1}{2}$, and the $y$-intercept $b$ is given by $0=\frac{1}{2}a+b$, so $b=-\frac{1}{2}a$. Thus, we have the equation $y=\frac{1}{2}x-\frac{1}{2}a$. Multiplying both sides by $2$ gives $2y=x-a$, which rearranges to $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ x+2y=a}$.

  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
Response 0:
1 decagram $= 10 \text{ grams} = 10,000 \text{ milligrams}$

Thus, 2 decagrams $= 20,000 \text{ milligrams}$.

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are $20,000/1,000 = 20$ grams in 2 decagrams.

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are $20 \cdot 1,000 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 20,\!000}$ milligrams in 2 decagrams. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
1 decagram = 10 grams = 10,000 milligrams

So, 2 decagrams = 20 grams = 20,000 milligrams

Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
1 decagram $=10 \text{ grams} =10^{4} \text{ milligrams}$. So, 2 decagrams $=2 \times 10^{4} \text{ milligrams}$. 

Therefore, there are $2 \times 10^{4} \text{ milligrams}$ in one 2-decagram container, and since 1 milligram is the same as $10^{-3}$ decagrams, there are $2 \times 10^{4} \times 10^{3} = 2 \times 10^{7}$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
We can solve this problem by using unit conversions. We know that 1 decagram is equal to 10 grams, so 2 decagrams is equal to 20 grams. We also know that 1,000 milligrams is equal to 1 gram, so 20 grams is equal to 20,000 milligrams. Therefore, there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Since 1 decagram is equal to 10 grams, 2 decagrams is equal to 20 grams. Therefore, there are 20,000 milligrams in a 2-decagram container (20 grams x 1,000 milligrams/gram). To find the number of 1-milligram doses in a 2-decagram container, we divide 20,000 by 1: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
One decagram is equal to 10 grams, so two decagrams is equal to 20 grams. We can then convert 20 grams to milligrams by multiplying by 1000 since there are 1000 milligrams in 1 gram. Therefore, there are $20 \times 1000 = 20,000$ milligrams in one 2-decagram container. 

To find how many 1-milligram doses there are, we simply divide 20,000 by 1. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
One 2-decagram container contains $2 \cdot 10 = 20$ grams of medicine. Since $1,000$ milligrams is equal to $1$ gram, then $20$ grams is equal to $20,000$ milligrams. Therefore, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 20,\!000}$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Alternatively, we can convert 2 decagrams to milligrams first: $$2\text{ dag}=2\times 10\text{ g}=20\text{ g}=20\times 1000\text{ mg}=20,000\text{ mg}.$$Then divide $20,000$ by $1$ to get $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 20,\!000}$ 1-milligram doses.
Response 7:
Since 1 decagram = 10 grams, 2 decagrams = 20 grams. 

Since 1,000 milligrams = 1 gram, 20 grams = 20,000 milligrams. 

Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
1 decagram = 10 grams = 10,000 milligrams.

Therefore, 2 decagrams = 20 grams = 20,000 milligrams.

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are 20,000/1,000 = 20 grams in 2 decagrams.

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are 20 x 1,000 = 20,000 milligrams in 2 decagrams.

Therefore, there are 20,000/1 = 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
One 2-decagram container is equal to $2 \times 10 = 20$ grams. Since there are $1,000$ milligrams in one gram, there are $20 \times 1,000 = 20,000$ milligrams in one 2-decagram container. Therefore, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 20,000}$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ passes through the origin. Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 4
  C: 8
  D: 16
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, the line must have slope $\frac{32-0}{k-2} = \frac{k-0}{2-0} \implies k^2-64=0$. Thus, $k=\pm 8$. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
We know that the line passes through the origin, so the coordinates of both points $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ must satisfy the equation of the line $y = mx$. We can use the two points to form two equations and solve for $k$:
\begin{align*}
k &= 2m \\
32 &= km
\end{align*}
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get $32 = 2m^2$, which simplifies to $m^2 = 16$. Therefore, $m = \pm 4$. Substituting $m=4$ into the first equation gives $k = 8$, which is one of the answer choices. Substituting $m=-4$ gives $k=-8$, which is not one of the answer choices. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
We know that the line passes through the origin $(0,0)$, so the slope of the line is $\frac{32-0}{k-2}=\frac{k-0}{2-k}$, which simplifies to $\frac{16}{k-2}=\frac{k}{2-k}$. Cross-multiplying gives $k^2-4k=32$, which factors as $k(k-4)=32$. Thus, $k$ must be a factor of 32. The only answer choice that is a factor of 32 is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }4}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Substitute $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ into the equation of the line that passes through the origin, $y=mx$, to get: $$k=m(2)$$ $$32=m(k)$$ Solving for $m$ and equating the expressions for $m$, we get: $$m=\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$$ Cross multiplying and solving for $k$, we get: $$k^2=64$$ $$k=\pm 8$$ Therefore, the possible values of $k$ are $k=\pm 8$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Substitute $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ into the equation of the line that passes through the origin, we get:

$$\frac{32}{k}=\frac{k}{2}$$

Solving for $k$, we get:

$$k^2=64$$

Therefore, $k$ could be $\pm 8$.

The median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for all 50 states was $26.95 \%$. What is the difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states?
Choices:
  A: $0.05 \%$
  B: $0.95 \%$
  C: $1.22 \%$
  D: $7.45 \%$
Response 0:
First, we need to arrange the given percentages in ascending order: $19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%$. We can see that the median of these 7 states is $27.9\%$. The difference between this and the median for all 50 states, which is $26.95\%$, is $27.9\% - 26.95\% = 0.95\%$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 1:
The median of the 7 states can be found by listing them in order from least to greatest: $$19.5 \% \quad 21.9 \% \quad 25.9 \% \quad 27.9 \% \quad 30.1 \% \quad 35.5 \% \quad 36.4 \%$$ The median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median of these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $$|26.95 \% - 27.9 \%| = 0.95 \%$$ Answer: \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}.
Response 2:
First, we must order the percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for the 7 states in the table in increasing order: $$19.5 \% < 21.9 \% < 25.9 \% < 27.9 \% < 30.1 \% < 35.5 \% < 36.4 \%$$ The median of these 7 states is the middle number, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between $27.9 \%$ and $26.95 \%$ is $0.95 \%$.

The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
Unfortunately, the problem is incomplete as the subscriptions sold in 2014 are not given. Please provide the complete problem statement.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")  

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\approx 0.05$ or 5%. Letting y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, we want $2(0.05)=0.1$ to be double y. We have $$\frac{x-5880}{5880}=y\qquad\text{and}\qquad\frac{x-5880}{5880}=1+y.$$ Solving for y in the first equation gives $y=\frac{x-5880}{5880}$, and substituting this into the second equation and solving for $x$ gives $x=6440$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }6,\!440}$.

Then, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $\frac{x-5880}{5880}\times 100\%$, and the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\times 100\%$. Since the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is half of the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, we have:

$$\frac{\frac{x-5880}{5880}}{\frac{5880-5600}{5600}}=2$$

Solving for $x$, we get $x=6468$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }6,468}$.
Response 4:
Topic: Math  
Action: Answer("B") 

To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase:
percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$
Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, we have:
percent increase from 2012 to 2013 = $\frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
percent increase from 2013 to 2014 = $\frac{x-5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$
Since the manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, we have:
$2 \times (\text{percent increase from 2013 to 2014}) = \text{percent increase from 2012 to 2013}$
$2 \times \frac{x-5,880}{5,880} \times 100\% = 5\%$
Solving for x, we get:
$x = 6,027$
Therefore, the manager expected 6,027 subscriptions to be sold in 2014, which is answer choice B.
Response 5:
Unfortunately, there is no information provided for calculating the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".
Response 6:
Unfortunately, the question is incomplete as there are no directions provided. Please provide the complete question with all the necessary information.
Response 7:
First, we need to find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. 
The difference is $5,880 - 5,600 = 280$ subscriptions. 
The percent increase is $\frac{280}{5600} \cdot 100\% = 5\%$. 

Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013. 
The number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is then $x + 0.1x = 1.1x$, where we have added 10% to account for the percent increase. 

The percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $\frac{1.1x - x}{x} \cdot 100\% = 10\%$. 

Since the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, we have:

$$2\cdot 5\% = 10\%$$

This means that $x$ must be 5 times larger than the number of subscriptions sold in 2012. 

Therefore, $x = 5\cdot 5,600 = 28,000$ subscriptions sold in 2013. 

And the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $1.1x = 1.1\cdot 28,000 = 30,800$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
First, we need to determine the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. We start by finding the difference between the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 and 2012: 

$$5,880 - 5,600 = 280$$ 

To find the percent increase, we divide this difference by the original number of subscriptions sold in 2012 and multiply by 100: 

$$\frac{280}{5,600} \cdot 100 \approx 5$$ 

So the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 was approximately 5%. 

Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is 2x. 

To find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, we can start by finding the percent increase from 2013 to 2014: 

$$(1 + x) \cdot 5,880 = 5,880 + 5,880x$$ 

Next, we can use the fact that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 was double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014: 

$$2x = 2 \cdot \frac{5,880x}{5,880 + 5,880x}$$ 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

$$5,880 + 5,880x = 2 \cdot 5,880x$$ 

$$5,880 = 5,880x$$ 

$$x = 1$$ 

So the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is 100%. 

Finally, we can find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014: 

$$(1 + x) \cdot 5,880 = 2 \cdot 5,880 = 11,760$$ 

Therefore, the manager expected 11,760 subscriptions to be sold in 2014. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
First, we need to find the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Let the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 be $x$. Then, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $\frac{x-5880}{5880}\cdot100\%=\frac{x}{60}-98\%$. 

Next, we need to find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013, which is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\cdot100\%=5\%$. 

Since the manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, we have:

$$2\times5\%=\frac{x}{60}-98\%$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

\begin{align*}
2\times5\%&=\frac{x}{60}-98\% \\
10\%&=\frac{x}{60}-98\% \\
108\%&=\frac{x}{60} \\
x&=6{,}480
\end{align*}

Therefore, the manager expected 6,480 subscriptions to be sold in 2014.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A customer paid $\$ 53.00$ for a jacket after a 6 percent sales tax was added. What was the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 47.60$
  B: $\$ 50.00$
  C: $\$ 52.60$
  D: $\$ 52.84$
Response 0:
Let the price of the jacket before the sales tax be $x$. Then, $x + 0.06x = 53$. Simplifying this equation, we get $1.06x = 53$, and solving for $x$, we get $x = 50$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added.

Action: Answer("A") 

We can solve this problem by dividing the total cost by 1 plus the tax rate as follows:

Let $x$ be the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added. Then we have:

$$x + 0.06x = 53.00$$

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:

$$1.06x = 53.00$$

Dividing both sides by 1.06, we get:

$$x = \frac{53.00}{1.06} \approx 47.17$$

Rounding to the nearest cent, we get:

$$x \approx \$ 47.60$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ \$ 47.60}$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
To solve the problem, we can start by assuming that the original price of the jacket is $x$. Then, we add 6% of $x$ to get the total price paid:
$$x + 0.06x = 53$$
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$$1.06x = 53$$
Dividing both sides by 1.06, we get:
$$x = \frac{53}{1.06} \approx 50$$
Therefore, the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added was $\$ 50.00$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Let x be the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added. 

Since the sales tax is 6%, then the total price paid is:

x + 0.06x = 1.06x

We know that the total price paid is $53.00, so we can set up the following equation:

1.06x = 53

Solving for x, we get:

x = 50

Therefore, the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added was $\$ 50.00$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's assume the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added is $x$. 

The price of the jacket after adding the 6% sales tax is:

$x + 0.06x = 1.06x$

We know that the price of the jacket after adding the sales tax is $\$ 53.00$. So we can write:

$1.06x = 53$

Dividing both sides by 1.06, we get:

$x = \frac{53}{1.06} \approx 50$

Therefore, the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added is $\$ 50.00$.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company purchased a machine valued at $\$ 120,000$. The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year so that after 10 years the value will be $\$ 30,000$. Which of the following equations gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased for $0 \leq t \leq 10 ?$
Choices:
  A: $v=30,000-9,000 t$
  B: $v=120,000-9,000 t$
  C: $v=120,000+9,000 t$
  D: $v=120,000-30,000 t$
Response 0:
We can use the information given to form a linear equation in slope-intercept form, $y=mx+b$, where $y$ is the value of the machine at time $t$, $m$ is the rate of depreciation per year, $x$ is the time in years, and $b$ is the initial value of the machine. 

We know that the initial value of the machine is $\$ 120,000$ and the value after $10$ years is $\$ 30,000$. The difference between the initial and final values is $\$ 90,000$, which occurs over a period of $10$ years. Therefore, the rate of depreciation per year is $\$ 9,000$. 

Using this information, we can write the equation as $v=120,000-9,000t$.

Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
We can use the given information to set up a system of equations. Let $d$ be the amount of depreciation per year. Then we have:

$120,000 - d(10) = 30,000$

Solving for $d$, we get $d = 9,000$. 

So the value of the machine, $v$, after $t$ years is:

$v = 120,000 - 9,000t$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $v=120,000-9,000 t$.
Response 4:
We can find the amount of depreciation per year by subtracting the final value from the initial value and dividing by the number of years: 

$\frac{120,000-30,000}{10}=9,000$

This means that the value of the machine decreases by $9,000$ dollars per year. 

At time $t=0$, the value of the machine is $v=120,000$. For each year that passes, the value decreases by $9,000$, so the equation for the value of the machine is:

$v=120,000-9,000t$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ v=120,000-9,000t}$.

Topic: Math
Question: Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week?
Choices:
  A: 38
  B: 33
  C: 22
  D: 16
Response 0:
Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Ken's total earnings for the week is $8 \cdot 10 + 10h = 80+10h$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10h)=72+9h$ dollars. We want $72+9h\geq 270$, which simplifies to $h\geq 22$. The least integer greater than or equal to $22$ is $22$, so the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 22}$.
Response 1:
Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then he worked $10$ hours in the first part of the week, so his total earnings for the week is $8(10)+10h=80+10h$. Ken saves $90\%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10h)=72+9h$ dollars for the week. We want to find the least $h$ such that $72+9h\geq 270$. Solving this inequality gives $h\geq 22$. The smallest integer greater than or equal to $22$ is $22$ itself, so the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 2:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken needs to work to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week. 
The amount of money Ken earns in the first $10$ hours is $10 \cdot 8 = 80$ dollars. 
For the remaining $x$ hours, he earns $\$10$ per hour. Therefore, he earns $10x$ dollars for the remaining $x$ hours. 
The total amount of money he earns for the week is $80+10x$ dollars. 
He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$ dollars for the week. 
We want to find the least value of $x$ such that $72+9x\geq 270$. 
Solving for $x$, we get $x\geq 22$. 
Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 3:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works after the first 10 hours. Then, he earns $8 \cdot 10 + 10x$ dollars in total. He saves $90 \%$ of this, which is $0.9(80 + 10x) = 72 + 9x$ dollars. We want to solve the inequality $72 + 9x \ge 270$, which simplifies to $x \ge 22$. The least integer greater than or equal to 22 is  $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 4:
Let the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week be $h$. Then, the total amount he earns in a week is $8 \cdot 10 + 10h = 80 + 10h$ dollars. Ken saves $90 \%$ of this, or $0.9(80+10h)=72+9h$ dollars. We want to solve the inequality $72+9h \geq 270$. Simplifying gives $h \geq \frac{198}{9}$. The smallest integer greater than $\frac{198}{9}$ is $22$, so Ken must work at least $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$ hours.
Response 5:
Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, he worked 10 hours at $\$8$ per hour, so he earned $\$80$ from those hours. He then worked $h$ hours at $\$10$ per hour, so he earned $\$100h$. Therefore, his total earnings are $\$80 + \$100h$. 

Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week, so he saves $0.9(\$80 + \$100h) = \$72 + \$90h$ each week. We want to find the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$270$, so we solve the inequality $\$72 + \$90h \geq \$270$:

\begin{align*}
\$72 + \$90h &\geq \$270 \\
\$90h &\geq \$198 \\
h &\geq \frac{22}{5}
\end{align*}

The least integer value of $h$ that satisfies this inequality is $5$, so Ken must work at least $5$ hours the rest of the week to save at least $\$270$ for the week.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(None of the Above)}}$.
Response 6:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then the total amount he earns for the week is $8\cdot 10 + 10x = 80+10x$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of this, so he saves $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$ dollars. We want this to be at least $270$, so we have the inequality $72+9x\geq 270$, which simplifies to $9x\geq 198$. Dividing both sides by $9$ gives $x\geq 22$. Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 7:
Let's say Ken worked $x$ hours the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours in the beginning of the week. Therefore, he earned $8 \cdot 10 = 80$ dollars in the beginning of the week. For the rest of the week, he earned $10x$ dollars. In total, he earned $80+10x$ dollars. He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$ dollars. We want to know the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$. Therefore, we need to solve the inequality $72+9x \geq 270$. Solving this inequality gives us $x \geq 22$. Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 8:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week. We can set up the equation: 

\begin{align*}
0.9\left(10\cdot 10 + 10x\right) &\geq 270\\
9\cdot 10 + 9x &\geq 3000\\
10 + x &\geq 333.\overline{3}\\
\end{align*}

Therefore, $x$ must be at least $324$ hours. Since the maximum number of hours Ken can work for the rest of the week is $40-10=30$, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 16}$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken worked after the first 10 hours. Then, he earned $8(10) + 10x = 80 + 10x$ dollars. Since Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, he saves $0.9(80+10x) = 72+9x$ dollars. We want to solve for $x$ in the inequality $72+9x \geq 270$. Solving, we get $x \geq 22$. Therefore, Ken must work at least $22$ hours the rest of the week to save at least $\$270$ for the week.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages. For each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. What is the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 6
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries 'x' 100-pound packages and 'y' 120-pound packages. We know that:
- x + y ≥ 10  (the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
- 100x + 120y ≤ 1100  (the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)

To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, we want to minimize the number of 100-pound packages. The smallest possible value for x is 1 (if x=0, then y would have to be at least 10, which would exceed the weight limit). Substituting x=1 into the second equation, we get:
100(1) + 120y ≤ 1100
120y ≤ 1000
y ≤ 8.33

Since y must be a whole number, the maximum possible value for y is 8. Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 8.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's assume the number of 100-pound packages to be x and the number of 120-pound packages to be y.
We know that x+y >= 10 and 100x+120y <= 1100.
We need to find the maximum value of y that satisfies these conditions.

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 20.
5x+6y <= 55
6y <= 55 - 5x
y <= (55 - 5x)/6

Now, we can use trial and error to find the maximum integer value of y that satisfies the first equation x+y >= 10.
If x=1, y=9 which satisfies both the equations.
If x=2, y=7.5 which is not an integer.
If x=3, y=6.67 which is not an integer.
If x=4, y=5.83 which is not an integer.
If x=5, y=5 which satisfies both the equations and is the maximum value of y.

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's assume the helicopter carries x 100-pound packages and y 120-pound packages. We know that:

x + y ≥ 10 (the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
100x + 120y ≤ 1100 (the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)

We want to find the maximum value of y that satisfies these two inequalities. 

We can rewrite the first inequality as x ≥ 10 - y. Substituting this into the second inequality, we get:

100(10 - y) + 120y ≤ 1100
1000 - 100y + 120y ≤ 1100
20y ≤ 100
y ≤ 5

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries x 100-pound packages and y 120-pound packages per trip. From the problem statement, we know that we have two constraints: 
1. x + y >= 10 (the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
2. 100x + 120y <= 1100 (the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)

We need to maximize y, so we need to solve for y in terms of x and then find the maximum value of y that satisfies the two constraints.

100x + 120y <= 1100
12y <= 1100 - 100x
y <= (1100 - 100x)/12

Now we can substitute the inequality constraint x + y >= 10 into the equation for y:

x + y >= 10
y >= 10 - x

Combining the two inequalities, we get:

10 - x <= y <= (1100 - 100x)/12

To maximize y, we need to set y equal to its upper bound:

y = (1100 - 100x)/12

To find the maximum value of y, we need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies this equation and the constraint x + y >= 10. 

Substituting y = (1100 - 100x)/12 into x + y >= 10, we get:

x + (1100 - 100x)/12 >= 10
12x + 1100 - 100x >= 120
12x - 100x >= 20
x >= 5/6

Since x must be a whole number (it represents the number of 100-pound packages), the smallest possible value of x is 1. Therefore, the maximum possible value of x is 1. 

Substituting x = 1 into y = (1100 - 100x)/12, we get:

y = (1100 - 100)/12 = 8.33

Since y must be a whole number (it represents the number of 120-pound packages), the largest possible value of y is 8. Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 8.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let x be the number of 100-pound packages and y be the number of 120-pound packages. We are looking to maximize y, subject to the constraints:
10 ≤ x + y
100x + 120y ≤ 1100
We can simplify the second constraint by dividing both sides by 20:
5x + 6y ≤ 55
Now we can graph the feasible region and look for the corner point that maximizes y:

(0, 10)   (5, 5.83)   (10, 2.5)
   +---------+-----------+
   |         |           |
   |         |           |
   |         |           |
   |         |           |
   +---------+-----------+
(0, 0)     (2.5, 5)    (5, 0)

The corner point that maximizes y is (5, 5.83), so the maximum number of 120-pound packages is approximately 5.83, which we must round down to 5.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's assume the helicopter carries x 100-pound packages and y 120-pound packages. 

According to the given information, we know that:
- x + y ≥ 10 (at least 10 packages per trip)
- 100x + 120y ≤ 1100 (total weight of packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)

We need to find the maximum value of y. 

To solve this problem, we can start by rearranging the second inequality:
100x + 120y ≤ 1100
10x + 12y ≤ 110
5x + 6y ≤ 55

Now, we can use the first inequality to eliminate x:
x + y ≥ 10
x ≥ 10 - y

Substituting this into the second inequality:
5x + 6y ≤ 55
5(10-y) + 6y ≤ 55
50 - 5y + 6y ≤ 55
y ≤ 5

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$
Response 0:
To find the best linear function that models the oil and gas production, we need to find the slope of the line. The slope of a line is given by the formula:

$$
m = \frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}
$$

In this case, the change in $y$ is the difference between the production in 2000 and the production in 2013, which is $1.9 - 4 = -2.1$ million barrels. The change in $x$ is the number of years between 2000 and 2013, which is $2013 - 2000 = 13$ years. Therefore, the slope of the line is:

$$
m = \frac{-2.1}{13} \approx -0.162
$$

The $y$-intercept of the line is the production in 2000, which is 4 million barrels. Therefore, the equation of the line is:

$$
f(t) = -0.162t + 4
$$

To simplify this equation and match it with one of the given choices, we can write it as:

$$
f(t) = -\frac{81}{500}t + 4
$$

Therefore, the best linear function that models the production is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we need to find the slope of the line that passes through the points $(0, 4)$ and $(13, 1.9)$, where $t$ represents the number of years after 2000 and $f(t)$ represents the oil and gas production in millions of barrels. 

The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula:

$$\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$

Using this formula, we get:

$$\frac{1.9-4}{13-0}=-\frac{21}{130}$$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
To find the linear function, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear function, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of 2.1 million barrels over 13 years. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13}$ million barrels per year. 

To find the slope, we need to change the units of time to years after 2000. So, for example, 2000 is year 0, and 2013 is year 13. Therefore, $t$ years after 2000 is the same as $t+0$ years after 2000. 

Using the slope formula, we get:

$$m=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}=\frac{-2.1}{13}=-\frac{21}{130}$$

To find the y-intercept, we can use the fact that the production was 4 million barrels in 2000, which is the same as $y=4$ when $t=0$. Therefore, $b=4$. 

Putting it all together, we get the linear function:

$$f(t)=mt+b=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
To find the linear function that models the oil and gas production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

The production decreased from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels over a period of 13 years. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13}\approx 0.1615$ million barrels per year.

The slope of the linear function that models the production is equal to the rate of decrease, which is negative because the production is decreasing. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B because they have positive slopes. 

The y-intercept of the linear function that models the production is the production in the year 2000, which is 4 million barrels. Therefore, we can eliminate choice D because it has a y-intercept of 3.85, which is not close to 4.

The only remaining choice is C, which has a slope of $-\frac{21}{130}=-0.1615$ and a y-intercept of 4. Therefore, the linear function $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
We can start by finding the rate of decrease in production per year. From 2000 to 2013, there are 13 years, and the production decreased by 4 - 1.9 = 2.1 million barrels. Therefore, the rate of decrease is 2.1/13 = 0.1615 million barrels per year. 

We can now use the point-slope form of a linear function to find the best model. The point-slope form is given by $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope of the line. We can use the point $(0, 4)$ since the production in the year 2000 was 4 million barrels. 

Substituting $x_1 = 0$, $y_1 = 4$, and $m = -0.1615$ into the point-slope form, we get:

$f(t) - 4 = -0.1615(t - 0)$

Simplifying, we get:

$f(t) = -0.1615t + 4$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.
Response 5:
To find the correct answer, we need to use the slope-intercept form of the linear function, which is $f(t)=mt+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

Since the oil and gas production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, the change in production over the 13-year period is $1.9-4=-2.1$ million barrels. 

The rate of change, or the slope, is therefore:

$$m=\frac{\text{change in production}}{\text{change in time}}=\frac{-2.1}{13}=-\frac{21}{130}$$

The y-intercept is the initial production in 2000, which is 4 million barrels. 

Therefore, the correct linear function is:

$$f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$$

Answer: Answer(C)
Response 6:
We can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, $y=mx+b$, where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the independent variable, $m$ is the slope of the line, and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. 

From 2000 to 2013, the time elapsed is 13 years, and the production decreased by $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13}\approx 0.1615$ million barrels per year. 

Since the production decreased, the slope of the line should be negative. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B.

The $y$-intercept is the initial production in 2000, which is 4 million barrels. Therefore, we can eliminate choice C.

Thus, the best choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4}$.
Response 7:
To find the best linear function $f$, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. 

We know that the production decreased from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of 2.1 million barrels over 13 years. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13} \approx 0.1615$ million barrels per year.

Since the production decreased, the slope of the linear function $f$ must be negative. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B, which have positive slopes.

To find the $y$-intercept, we can use the fact that the production was 4 million barrels in 2000. Therefore, we need to find the value of $f(0)$ for each of the remaining choices:

- For choice C: $f(0) = 4$
- For choice D: $f(0) = 4$

Both choices C and D have the correct $y$-intercept, but we need to check which one has the correct slope. 

Since we know that the average rate of decrease is approximately 0.1615 million barrels per year, we can check which choice has a slope closest to this value:

- For choice C: the slope is $-\frac{21}{130} \approx -0.1615$
- For choice D: the slope is $-\frac{19}{130} \approx -0.1462$

Therefore, the best linear function $f$ that models the production is given by choice C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To find the linear function that models the production, we need to find the slope and the y-intercept of the line that passes through the points $(0,4)$ and $(13,1.9)$. 

The slope of the line is $\frac{1.9-4}{13-0}=-\frac{21}{130}$. 

The y-intercept of the line is 4. 

Therefore, the linear function that models the production is $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The formula below is often used by project managers to compute $E$, the estimated time to complete a job, where $O$ is the shortest completion time, $P$ is the longest completion time, and $M$ is the most likely completion time.$$E=\frac{O+4 M+P}{6}$$Which of the following correctly gives $P$ in terms of $E, O$, and $M$ ?
Choices:
  A: $P=6 E-O-4 M$
  B: $P=-6 E+O+4 M$
  C: $P=\frac{O+4 M+E}{6}$
  D: $P=\frac{O+4 M-E}{6}$
Response 0:
We can solve the given formula for $P$ by multiplying both sides by $6$ and then subtracting $O$ and $4M$ from both sides. This gives us: $$6E=O+4M+P$$$$6E-O-4M=P$$Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
To solve for $P$, we can rearrange the given formula as:
$$E=\frac{O+4 M+P}{6}$$
$$O+4 M+P=6 E$$
$$P=6 E-O-4 M$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
To solve for $P$, we can rearrange the formula as follows: $$E=\frac{O+4M+P}{6}$$
$$O+4M+P = 6E$$
$$P=6E-O-4M$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
We can solve the given equation for $P$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
E&=\frac{O+4 M+P}{6}\\
6E&=O+4M+P\\
P&=6E-O-4M
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(A)}\ P=6 E-O-4 M$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
We can solve the given formula for $P$ by multiplying both sides by 6, then subtracting $O$ and $4M$ from both sides. 

\begin{align*}
6E&=O+4M+P \\
6E-O-4M&=P \\
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A") $P=6E-O-4M$
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
We can solve the formula for $P$ by multiplying both sides by $6$ to get $$6E=O+4M+P.$$Then we can isolate $P$ by subtracting $O+4M$ from both sides to get $$P=6E-O-4M.$$Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline1 & 5 \\\hline3 & 13 \\\hline5 & 21 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of the linear function $f$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=2 x+3$
  B: $f(x)=3 x+2$
  C: $f(x)=4 x+1$
  D: $f(x)=5 x$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
To find the equation of a line given two points, we need to first find the slope of the line. The slope of the line passing through the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. 

Next, we need to find the $y$-intercept of the line. We know that the line passes through the point $(1,5)$, so we can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the line: $y-5=4(x-1)$. Simplifying this equation gives $y=4x+1$. 

Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4x+1}$.
Response 2:
We can use the two points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ to find the slope of the line. The slope is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. Therefore, the equation of the line can be written as $f(x)=4x+b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. We can find $b$ by plugging in the point $(1,5)$: $5=4(1)+b$, so $b=1$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
We notice that the difference between consecutive $f(x)$ values is always $8$. Therefore, the slope of the linear function is $\frac{8}{2}=4$. The y-intercept of the function is $f(1)-4(1)=5-4=1$. Therefore, the equation of the function is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
We can see that the change in $f(x)$ for every increase of $x$ is $8$. Therefore, the slope of the line is $8/2=4$. To find the $y$-intercept, we can plug in the values of $x$ and $f(x)$ from any of the given points in the table. For example, using the first point $(1,5)$, we get $5=4(1)+b$, which gives us $b=1$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4 x+1}$.
Response 5:
We can see that as $x$ increases by $2$, $f(x)$ increases by $8$. Therefore, the slope of the line is $8/2=4$. We also see that $f(1)=5$, so the $y$-intercept is $(0,5-4(1))=(0,1)$. Thus, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
We can use the given values in the table to form a system of equations and solve for the coefficients of the linear function. Using the point-slope form of a linear function, we have:

$f(1) = 5 = m(1) + b$

$f(3) = 13 = m(3) + b$

$f(5) = 21 = m(5) + b$

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

$8 = 2m + 0$

$m = 4$

Subtracting the second equation from the third equation, we get:

$8 = 2m + 0$

$m = 4$

So we have $m = 4$ and we can substitute this into any of the three equations above to solve for $b$. Using the first equation, we get:

$5 = 4(1) + b$

$b = 1$

Therefore, the linear function $f(x)$ that fits the given data is:

$f(x) = 4x + 1$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
We can find the slope of the line by finding the difference in $f(x)$ values and the corresponding difference in $x$ values. The slope is $\frac{21-5}{5-1}=4$.  Then we can substitute one of the points to find the $y$-intercept. Using $(1,5)$, we have $y=4x+b \Rightarrow 5=4(1)+b \Rightarrow b=1$. Therefore, $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We can see that when $x=1$, $f(x)=5$. This means that the $y$-intercept of the linear function is 5. Using this information, we can eliminate choices (A) and (B) since they do not have a $y$-intercept of 5. 

Now, we can use the information for another point, say $(3,13)$. Using the slope formula, we get:

$$\text{slope}=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$$

Therefore, the equation of the linear function can be written as:

$$f(x)=\text{slope}\cdot x+\text{y-intercept}=4x+5$$

So, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To determine the equation of a linear function, we need to find the slope and the $y$-intercept. From the table, we can see that when $x=1$, $f(x)=5$, and when $x=3$, $f(x)=13$. The slope is the change in $f(x)$ divided by the change in $x$, which is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. To find the $y$-intercept, we can use the point $(1,5)$ and the slope $4$ in the point-slope form of a line: $f(x)-5=4(x-1)$. Simplifying this equation gives $f(x)=4x+1$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4x+1}$.

Question: Dreams Recalled during One Week\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\hline& None & 1 to 4 & 5 or more & Total \\\hline\hlineGroup X & 15 & 28 & 57 & 100 \\\hlineGroup Y & 21 & 11 & 68 & 100 \\\hlineTotal & 36 & 39 & 125 & 200 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The data in the table above were produced by a sleep researcher studying the number of dreams people recall when asked to record their dreams for one week. Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$
Response 0:
The probability of choosing a person who recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{39+125}{200}= \frac{164}{200}$.

The probability of choosing a person who belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{68}{200}$.

Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is:

$\frac{\frac{68}{200}}{\frac{164}{200}} = \frac{68}{164} = \frac{17}{41}$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$
Response 1:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that the person recalled at least 1 dream can be calculated as follows: 

\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}} &= \frac{68}{39+68} \\
&= \frac{68}{107} \\
&= \boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}
\end{align*}
Response 2:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is equal to the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. From the table, we see that the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $39+125=164$. The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is $11+68=79$. Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{79}{164}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Out of the 39 people who recalled 1 or more dream, 68-11=57 people from Group Y recalled 5 or more dreams. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is $\frac{57}{39+57}=\frac{57}{96}=\frac{19}{32}$. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Let's focus on the relevant information: out of the total of 164 people who recalled at least one dream, 68 were from Group Y. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{\text{number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream}}{\text{total number of people who recalled at least one dream}}=\frac{68}{164}$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
The probability of choosing a person from Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is: $\frac{68+11}{100}=0.79$. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
The probability of selecting a person who recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{200-36}{200}=\frac{164}{200}$. The probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{68}{68+11}=\frac{68}{79}$. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. From the table, we can see that the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $39+125=164$, and the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is $11+68=79$. Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{79}{164}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
The probability of selecting a person who recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{125}{200} = \frac{5}{8}$. The probability of selecting a person from Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{68}{100} = \frac{17}{25}$. Therefore, the probability of selecting a person who recalled at least 1 dream and belonged to Group Y is:
$$\frac{17}{25} \cdot \frac{100}{200} = \frac{17}{50} = \frac{34}{100} = \frac{17}{50}$$
So, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{68}{100}}$.
Response 9:
We want to find the probability that a person who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y. We can use the formula:

$$P(\text{Group Y}|\text{at least 1 dream})=\frac{P(\text{at least 1 dream}|\text{Group Y})\cdot P(\text{Group Y})}{P(\text{at least 1 dream})}$$

We can find each of the probabilities on the right-hand side of the equation using the information from the table. 

$P(\text{at least 1 dream}|\text{Group Y})=\frac{11+68}{100}=0.79$

$P(\text{Group Y})=\frac{100}{200}=0.5$

$P(\text{at least 1 dream})=\frac{39+125}{200}=0.82$

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

$$P(\text{Group Y}|\text{at least 1 dream})=\frac{0.79\cdot 0.5}{0.82}=\frac{0.395}{0.82}\approx 0.4829$$

Therefore, the answer is approximately $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{79}{164}}$.

Question: $$C=75 h+125$$The equation above gives the amount $C$, in dollars, an electrician charges for a job that takes $h$ hours. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland each hired this electrician. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. How much more did the electrician charge Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 75$
  B: $\$ 125$
  C: $\$ 150$
  D: $\$ 275$
Response 0:
Let's start by finding the cost of Mr. Roland's job. Let $x$ be the number of hours he hired the electrician for. Then, the cost of his job is $C = 75x + 125$.
Ms. Sanchez hired the electrician for 2 hours longer, so she hired him for $x+2$ hours. Therefore, the cost of her job is $C = 75(x+2) + 125 = 75x + 225$.
The difference in cost between Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job is:
$$(75x + 225) - (75x + 125) = 100$$
Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Let's first find out how much the electrician charged for Mr. Roland's job. If the electrician worked $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job, then he worked $h+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. 

For Mr. Roland's job, $h=2$ (since it took $2$ hours less than Ms. Sanchez's job). Substituting this value in the equation, we get: 

$$C=75h+125=75(2)+125=275$$

So, the electrician charged Mr. Roland $\$275$.

For Ms. Sanchez's job, $h+2=4$ (since the electrician worked $2$ hours longer than Mr. Roland's job). Substituting this value in the equation, we get:

$$C=75h+125=75(4)+125=425$$

So, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$425$.

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$425-\$275=\$150$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding out how much the electrician charged Mr. Roland. If he worked for $x$ hours, then the amount charged would be $C = 75x + 125$. Now, let's say the electrician worked for $x+2$ hours for Ms. Sanchez. The amount charged would be $C = 75(x+2) + 125 = 75x + 275$. The difference between the two amounts is $(75x + 275) - (75x + 125) = 150$, which means the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's first find the cost for Mr. Roland's job. If the electrician worked for $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job, then the cost of the job would be $$C=75h+125.$$ Now, let's assume that the electrician worked for $h+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. The cost of this job would be $$C=75(h+2)+125=75h+225.$$ The difference in cost between Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job would be $$75h+225-(75h+125)=100.$$ Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$ 100$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Let's first find out how much the electrician charged Mr. Roland. Let's say Mr. Roland's job took $x$ hours. Then, the electrician charged him $C=75x+125$ dollars. 

We know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job, so her job took $x+2$ hours. Thus, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $C=75(x+2)+125=75x+225$ dollars. 

The question asks for the difference in the amount charged to Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland, which is:

$$(75x+225)-(75x+125)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$150}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$150}$.
Response 5:
Let's first find out the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. Let's assume he worked for $x$ hours on Mr. Roland's job. Therefore, he worked for $(x+2)$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. Using the given equation, we can find the amount charged by the electrician for each job as follows:

For Mr. Roland: $C=75x+125$

For Ms. Sanchez: $C=75(x+2)+125=75x+225$

The difference between the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job is:

$$(75x+225)-(75x+125)=100$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$ 100$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Let's first find the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. Let's substitute the value of $h$ as $x$ in the given equation. 

So, for Mr. Roland's job, $C=75x+125$.

For Ms. Sanchez's job, the electrician worked $2$ hours longer. So, the hours worked can be represented as $x+2$. 

So, for Ms. Sanchez's job, $C=75(x+2)+125=75x+225$.

The difference between the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job is:

$75x+225-(75x+125)=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$150}$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$150}$.
Response 7:
Let's start by finding out how much the electrician charged Mr. Roland. Let's plug in $h$ into the equation $C=75h+125$, where $h$ is the number of hours the electrician worked on Mr. Roland's job. 

$C = 75h + 125$

Now, let's find out how much the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez. We know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job, so the number of hours the electrician worked on her job is $h+2$. Let's plug this into the equation $C=75h+125$.

$C = 75(h+2) + 125 = 75h + 150 + 125 = 75h + 275$

So, Ms. Sanchez was charged $75h+275$ dollars, and Mr. Roland was charged $75h+125$ dollars. To find out how much more Ms. Sanchez was charged, we need to subtract Mr. Roland's charge from Ms. Sanchez's charge:

$(75h+275)-(75h+125) = 150$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$150}$.
Response 8:
Let's first calculate the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. As per the given equation, 

$C = 75h + 125$

Let's assume that the electrician worked for $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job. So, the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job is $C_1 = 75h+125$.

Now, the electrician worked for 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job. So, the amount charged by the electrician for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C_2 = 75(h+2) + 125 = 75h + 275$.

Therefore, the difference in the amount charged by the electrician for Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job is:

$C_2 - C_1 = (75h + 275) - (75h + 125) = 150$

So, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$150}$.
Response 9:
Let's first find the cost of Mr. Roland's job. Let $x$ be the number of hours the electrician worked on Mr. Roland's job. Then, we know that the cost of Mr. Roland's job is $C=75x+125$ dollars. 

We also know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job, so the number of hours the electrician worked on Ms. Sanchez's job is $x+2$. Therefore, the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job is $C=75(x+2)+125=75x+225$ dollars. 

The difference in cost between Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job is:

\begin{align*}
75x+225-(75x+125)&=100\\
\end{align*}

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ be the energy per gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. Then we have the system of equations
\begin{align*}
180 &= E_p p + E_f f + E_c c \\
&= 4p + 9f + 4c.
\end{align*}
Solving for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ gives $f=\frac{1}{9}(180-4p-4c)=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.
Response 1:
The total number of grams of the three macronutrients is $p+c+f$. We are told that the 180 food calories in the granola bar come entirely from protein, fat, and carbohydrate. Since 1 gram of protein provides 4 food calories, 1 gram of fat provides 9 food calories, and 1 gram of carbohydrate provides 4 food calories, the 180 food calories in the granola bar give us the equation $$4p+9f+4c=180.$$Dividing both sides of this equation by 9 gives $$\frac{4}{9}p+f+\frac{4}{9}c=20.$$Solving this equation for $f$ gives $$f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c).$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 2:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ denote the energy, in calories, contributed by the protein, fat, and carbohydrate in the granola bar, respectively. Then we have $E_p = 4p$, $E_f = 9f$, and $E_c = 4c$. Since the total energy in the granola bar is 180 calories, we have $$E_p + E_f + E_c = 4p + 9f + 4c = 180.$$Solving for $f$, we get $$9f = 180 - 4p - 4c = 4(45 - p - c) = 4(20 + (p+c) - (p+c-25)) = 4(20 + (p+c)) - 4(p+c-25) = 80 + 4(p+c) - 9(p+c-25) = 80 - 5(p+c) + 225 = 305 - 5(p+c).$$Therefore, $$f = \frac{305 - 5(p+c)}{9} = 20 + \frac{1}{9}(5c - p).$$Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)}.$
Response 3:
The amount of energy from fat is $9f$ calories. The amount of energy from protein is $4p$ calories and the amount of energy from carbohydrate is $4c$ calories. Since the total amount of energy is 180 calories, we have the equation $9f+4p+4c=180$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 4:
The amount of energy from 1 gram of protein is 4 food calories, and the amount of energy from 1 gram of carbohydrate is also 4 food calories. So the amount of energy from $p$ grams of protein and $c$ grams of carbohydrate is $4p+4c$ food calories. The amount of energy from $f$ grams of fat is $9f$ food calories. We know that the total amount of energy is 180 food calories, so we can set up the equation $4p+4c+9f=180$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}=\frac{20}{9}(20-p-c)$. Multiplying out the right-hand side, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 5:
The energy from $p$ grams of protein is $4p$ food calories. The energy from $f$ grams of fat is $9f$ food calories. The energy from $c$ grams of carbohydrate is $4c$ food calories. Since the total energy is 180 food calories, we have the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{1}{9}(180-4p-4c)=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 6:
The energy in the granola bar comes entirely from protein, fat, and carbohydrate. Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ be the energy contributed by protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. We have the equations $E_p=4p$, $E_f=9f$, and $E_c=4c$. We also know that the total energy is 180 food calories, which is equal to $180\text{ food calories}\times\frac{16.7\text{ kJ}}{1\text{ food calorie}}=3006\text{ kJ}$. Thus we have the equation $E_p+E_f+E_c=3006$. Substituting the expressions for $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ gives the equation $4p+9f+4c=3006$, or $9f=3006-4p-4c$. Solving for $f$ gives $f=\frac{3006-4p-4c}{9}=334-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Thus the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 7:
Let's use the given information to set up an equation in terms of $p$, $f$, and $c$. We know that the total number of food calories is equal to the sum of the calories from protein, fat, and carbohydrate:
$$ 180 = 4p + 9f + 4c $$
We want to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$. First, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 9:
$$ 20 = \frac{4}{9}p + f + \frac{4}{9}c $$
Next, we can isolate $f$ by subtracting $\frac{4}{9}p$ and $\frac{4}{9}c$ from both sides:
$$ f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p + c) $$
Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 8:
The total energy in 180 food calories is equal to the sum of the energies from protein, fat, and carbohydrate. Using the table, we can write the equation: $180=4p+9f+4c$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}=\frac{20}{9}(9-p-c)$. Multiplying out the factor of $\frac{20}{9}$ gives $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 9:
Let's use the given information to set up an equation: 

$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$

We want to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$, so let's isolate $f$:

$9f = 180 - 4p - 4c$

$f = \frac{180 - 4p - 4c}{9}$

$f = \frac{20}{9}(9) - \frac{4}{9}(p + c)$

$f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p + c)$

Therefore, the answer is (B): $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 7
  C: 16
  D: 79
Response 0:
To solve the equation, we need to isolate $k$ on one side of the equation. We can start by adding $x$ to both sides of the equation to get: $$\sqrt{k+2}=x$$ Then we can square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root: $$k+2=x^2$$ Finally, we can solve for $k$ by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: $$k=x^2-2$$ Plugging in $x=9$ gives: $$k=9^2-2=79$$ Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:
$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\ \sqrt{k+2} &= x \\ k+2 &= x^2 \\ k &= x^2-2 \end{aligned}$$
Substituting $x=9$, we have:
$$k=9^2-2=79$$
Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Squaring both sides of the equation, we get: $$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$ $$\Rightarrow (\sqrt{k+2})^2 - 2x\sqrt{k+2} + x^2 = 0$$ $$\Rightarrow k+2 = \frac{x^2}{4}$$ $$\Rightarrow k = \frac{x^2}{4} - 2$$ Substituting $x=9$ in the above equation, we get: $$k = \frac{9^2}{4} - 2 = 20.25 - 2 = 18.25$$ Hence, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("None of the Above") [The answer is not one of the given choices. The answer is 18.25]
Response 3:
To solve the equation, we need to isolate $k$. We can start by squaring both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root sign:

$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\ (\sqrt{k+2}-x)^2&=0^2 \\ k+2-2x\sqrt{k+2}+x^2&=0 \end{aligned}$$

Now we can move all the terms with $k$ to one side and all the other terms to the other side:

$$\begin{aligned} k+2-2x\sqrt{k+2}+x^2&=0 \\ k+2&=2x\sqrt{k+2}-x^2 \\ k&=2x\sqrt{k+2}-x^2-2 \end{aligned}$$

Substituting $x=9$ and solving for $k$:

$$\begin{aligned} k&=2(9)\sqrt{k+2}-(9)^2-2 \\ &=18\sqrt{k+2}-83 \end{aligned}$$

We can now solve for $k$ by isolating the square root term and squaring both sides:

$$\begin{aligned} k+83&=18\sqrt{k+2} \\ (k+83)^2&=18^2(k+2) \\ k^2+166k+6886&=324k+5832 \\ k^2-158k+1054&=0 \end{aligned}$$

Using the quadratic formula:

$$k=\frac{-(-158)\pm\sqrt{(-158)^2-4(1)(1054)}}{2(1)}=\frac{158\pm\sqrt{2252}}{2}=79\pm\sqrt{563}$$

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
Response 0:
To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes the value of $a$ closest to 1,000. We can start by plugging in each answer choice into the equation and calculating the resulting value of $a$. However, this may be tedious, so we can use estimation instead.

If $t$ is decreased by 10, then $a$ is decreased by 8. So, to get from 1,052 to 1,000, we need to decrease $a$ by 52. Since each decrease of 10 in $t$ results in a decrease of 8 in $a$, we need to decrease $t$ by approximately $\frac{10}{8} \times 52 = 65$.

Starting with answer choice D, we can subtract 65 from $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to get $-115^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Plugging this into the equation, we get $a \approx 880$, which is too low.

Moving on to answer choice C, we can subtract 65 from $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to get $-114^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Plugging this into the equation, we get $a \approx 902$, which is closer but still too low.

Trying answer choice B, we can subtract 65 from $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to get $-113^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Plugging this into the equation, we get $a \approx 925$, which is too high.

Finally, we can try answer choice A. Subtracting 65 from $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ gives $-111^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Plugging this into the equation, we get $a \approx 981$, which is the closest to 1,000.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
We can solve the problem by finding the temperature $t$ that makes $a=1,000$. Substituting $a=1,000$ into the given equation and solving for $t$, we get:
$$1,000=1,052+1.08 t$$
$$1.08 t=52$$
$$t=\frac{52}{1.08}\approx48.15$$

To find the temperature at which the speed of sound is closest to 1,000 feet per second, we need to minimize the expression $|a-1000|$. This is equivalent to minimizing the expression $a-1000$ or $1000-a$, depending on whether $a$ is greater or less than 1,000. 

Setting $a-1000=0$ and solving for $t$, we get:
$$1,052+1.08t-1000=0$$
$$1.08t=52$$
$$t=\frac{52}{1.08}\approx 48.15$$

Therefore, the temperature closest to 1,000 feet per second is approximately $48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
We can solve the problem by finding the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can do this by comparing the differences between 1,000 and $a$ for each choice. The choice with the smallest difference is the answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that minimizes $|a-1000|$. Since $a=1,052+1.08 t$, we have $|a-1000|=|1,052+1.08 t-1000|=|52+1.08 t|$. Thus, we need to find the value of $t$ that minimizes $|52+1.08 t|$. 

Note that $52+1.08 t$ is an increasing function of $t$, so $|52+1.08 t|$ is minimized when $52+1.08 t$ is closest to zero. Solving $52+1.08 t=0$, we get $t\approx -48.15$. 

Therefore, the air temperature that results in a speed of sound closest to 1,000 feet per second is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ -48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}}$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
First, we can set up an equation to solve for $t$ when $a=1000$:
\begin{aligned} a &=1,052+1.08 t \\ 1000 &=1,052+1.08 t \\ -52 &=1.08 t \\ -48.\bar{1} & \approx t \end{aligned}
Therefore, the air temperature closest to $-48.\bar{1}$ is $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can start by plugging in each of the answer choices for $t$ and calculating the corresponding value of $a$. Then we can compare the values of $|a-1000|$ to see which one is smallest.

Action: 

Plug in $t=-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$:
$$
a=1,052+1.08(-46) \approx 1,000.32
$$
Plug in $t=-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$:
$$
a=1,052+1.08(-48) \approx 998.56
$$
Plug in $t=-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$:
$$
a=1,052+1.08(-49) \approx 999.44
$$
Plug in $t=-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$:
$$
a=1,052+1.08(-50) \approx 1,000.32
$$
Therefore, the answer is closest to 1,000 feet per second when the air temperature is $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 9:
We can solve the problem by finding the value of $t$ that minimizes the absolute difference between $a$ and 1,000. That is, we want to solve the equation $|a-1000|= \min$.

We can rewrite $|a-1000|$ as $\sqrt{(a-1000)^2}$, which is a smooth function that is minimized when its derivative is zero. Taking the derivative of $\sqrt{(a-1000)^2}$ with respect to $t$, we get:

$$\frac{da}{dt}=1.08$$

Setting $\frac{da}{dt}=1.08$ and solving for $t$, we get:

$$1.08t=48$$

$$t\approx44.44$$

Therefore, the air temperature that will make the speed of sound closest to 1,000 feet per second is approximately $44.44^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$2 a x-15=3(x+5)+5(x-1)$$In the equation above, $a$ is a constant. If no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, what is the value of $a$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 4
  D: 8
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")  

Explication: 

$$2ax-15=3(x+5)+5(x-1)$$
$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$(2a-8)x=25$$
$$x=\frac{25}{2a-8}$$

Since there is no value of $x$ that satisfies the equation, the denominator of the fraction $\frac{25}{2a-8}$ must be equal to zero. Therefore, we have:

$$2a-8=0$$
$$a=4$$
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B") 

The given equation can be simplified as $$(2a-8)x=43$$
For the equation to have no solution, the coefficient of x should be zero. Therefore, we get $$(2a-8)=0$$
Solving this equation gives $a=4$. Therefore, the answer is (C).
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can simplify the equation to: $$(2a-8)x=43$$
Since there is no value of $x$ that satisfies the equation, we know that $(2a-8)\neq 0$. Thus, $$2a-8\neq 0 \Rightarrow a\neq 4$$
Therefore, the value of $a$ must be 2, which is choice B.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can simplify the equation as follows:
$$2ax - 15 = 3x + 15 + 5x - 5$$
Simplifying further, we get:
$$2ax - 15 = 8x + 10$$
$$2ax - 8x = 25$$
$$2x(a-4) = 25$$
Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, we know that $a-4$ cannot be equal to 0 (otherwise, we could just substitute any value of $x$ and get a solution). Therefore, we can divide both sides by $2(a-4)$ to get:
$$x = \frac{25}{2(a-4)}$$
This equation has no solutions if the denominator is equal to 0, which means $a-4$ must be equal to 0. Therefore, $a=4$ is the value that makes the equation unsolvable.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B") 

Expanding and simplifying both sides of the equation, we get $$(2a-8)x=43.$$Since there is no value of $x$ that satisfies the equation, $2a-8 \neq 0$, which means $a \neq 4$. Thus, the only answer choice that could be correct is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 2}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")  
Solution: First, we simplify the right-hand side of the equation: $$2 a x-15=3(x+5)+5(x-1)$$$$2 a x-15=3x+15+5x-5$$$$2 a x-15=8x+10.$$Then, we simplify the left-hand side of the equation: $$2 a x-15=8x+10$$$$2 a x=8x+25$$$$a=\frac{8x+25}{2x}.$$Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, we know that the equation has no real solutions. This means that the discriminant of the quadratic equation formed by setting the left-hand side of the equation equal to zero is negative. The discriminant is $$b^2-4ac=(2a)^2-4(1)(-15)=4a^2+60.$$We know that this is negative, so $$4a^2+60<0.$$Dividing both sides by $4$ gives $$a^2+15<0.$$This is impossible for any real value of $a$, so there is no solution. Therefore, the answer is $a=\frac{8x+25}{2x}$ for any $x$ that satisfies the equation. In particular, we can take $x=1$ to get $a=\frac{33}{2}$, which is not one of the answer choices. The closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }2}$.

Question: The function $f$ is defined by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$. The graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following intervals contains the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-4<x<-3$
  B: $-3<x<1$
  C: $1<x<3$
  D: $3<x<4$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Explanation:  
We can expand the given function as $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. We can rewrite this as $f(x)=(x+2)^2-1$. Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is at $(-2,-1)$, and the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$. The correct interval that contains $-2$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -4 < x < -3}$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$, we use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$. In this case, we have $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$. Thus, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Since $-4<-2<1$, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is in the interval $-4<x<1$, which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("-2") 

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola of the form $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$ is $h$. We can rewrite $f(x)$ as $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$, which is in the form $f(x)=(x+h)^2+k$ where $h=2$ and $k=-1$. Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is at $x=-h=-2$. Hence, the answer is not any of the given intervals.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("-2")  

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$, we can use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where the quadratic function is in the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$. 

In this case, $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$ and $b=4$. Thus, 

$x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$

Therefore, the answer is not one of the given choices, but the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("-2") 

Explanation: The vertex of the parabola $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ is at $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic term and the linear term, respectively. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but rather the specific value $x=-2$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$, we need to use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$ where $ax^2+bx+c$ is the standard form of a quadratic function. In this case, $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$. Thus, $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Since $-4<x<-3$, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("-2")  

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ is $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("-2")  

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola defined by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$, we need to use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where the quadratic function is of the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$. 

In this case, we have $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. 

Therefore, the answer is not one of the given choices.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("-2") 

Explanation: 
To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$, we use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where the quadratic function is in the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$. In this case, $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$ and $b=4$. Substituting these values into the formula, we get $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$. Since $-4<-2<-3$, the answer is (A).
Response 9:
Action: Answer("-2") 

Explanation:
The vertex of the parabola $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ can be found by completing the square. We have $f(x)=(x+2)^2-1$. Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is $(-2,-1)$. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$, which is in the interval $-4<x<-3$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -4<x<-3}$.

Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")  

We are given that $y=100$ and we want to find $x$. Substituting the given values, we get $0.10 x+0.20 (100)=0.18(x+100)$. Simplifying gives $0.10x=2$, so $x=20$. Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 50}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ saline solution.
Response 1:
First, we need to solve for $x$ in the equation $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$ Expanding the right side gives $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18x+0.18y$$ Subtracting $0.18x$ and $0.20y$ from both sides gives $$0.02x=-0.02y$$ Dividing both sides by $-0.02$ gives $$x=y$$ This means that the amount of $10 \%$ saline solution used is equal to the amount of $20 \%$ saline solution used. Since Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ saline solution, he must also use 100 milliliters of the $10 \%$ saline solution. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
First, we can substitute $y=100$ into the equation to get $$0.10x+20=0.18(x+100).$$Simplifying the equation gives $$0.10x+20=0.18x+18.$$Solving for $x$ gives $$x=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 50}.$$
Response 3:
First, we can simplify the given equation as follows:
$$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$
$$0.10x+0.20y=0.18x+0.18y$$
$$0.02y=0.08x$$
$$y=4x$$

Since Clayton used a total of 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, we know that $y=100$.

Substituting this value into the equation we found earlier, we get:
$$100=4x$$
$$x=25$$

Therefore, Clayton must use 25 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
First, we can simplify the equation: $$0.10x+0.20y=0.18(x+y)$$$$0.10x+0.20y=0.18x+0.18y$$$$0.02y=0.08x$$$$y=4x$$ We know that $x+y=100$, so substituting $y=4x$ gives $x+4x=100$, or $x=20$. Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }25}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
First, we can simplify the equation by distributing the $0.18$ on the right side: $$0.10x+0.20y=0.18x+0.18y.$$Then, we can simplify further by subtracting $0.10x$ and $0.18y$ from both sides: $$0.02y=0.08x.$$Finally, we can solve for $x$ using the given value of $y=100$: $$0.02(100)=0.08x \implies x=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }50}.$$
Response 7:
The equation can be simplified as $0.02y=0.08x$ or $y=4x$. 
Since Clayton used 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, he will use $100/4=25$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
First, let's substitute $y=100$ into the equation to get rid of one variable: $$0.10 x+0.20 (100)=0.18(x+100)$$Simplifying, we have: $$0.10 x+20=0.18x+18$$Solving for $x$, we get: $$0.08x=2$$ $$x=25$$

Therefore, Clayton must use 25 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
First, we can simplify the equation by distributing the $0.18$ on the right-hand side: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18x+0.18y$$Then, we can simplify further by moving all the $x$ terms to the left-hand side and all the $y$ terms to the right-hand side: $$0.10 x - 0.18x = 0.18y - 0.20y$$Simplifying again, we get: $$-0.08x = -0.02y$$Dividing both sides by $-0.02$ gives us: $$4x = y$$We know that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, so $y=100$. Substituting this into the equation above, we get: $$4x = 100$$Solving for $x$, we get: $$x = 25$$Therefore, Clayton must use 25 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.

Question: Lani spent $15 \%$ of her 8-hour workday in meetings. How many minutes of her workday did she spend in meetings?
Choices:
  A: 1.2
  B: 15
  C: 48
  D: 72
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we need to convert 8 hours to minutes and then multiply it by $15 \%$.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 8 hours is equal to $8 \times 60 = 480$ minutes.

To find $15 \%$ of 480, we can multiply 480 by $0.15$:

$$480 \times 0.15 = 72$$

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

Response 4:
To solve this problem, we need to find $15 \%$ of 8 hours and convert it to minutes. 

Action: Answer("C") 

$15 \%$ of 8 hours is $(0.15)(8\text{ hours}) = 1.2$ hours. 

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60: 

$1.2 \text{ hours} \cdot 60 \frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}} = 72 \text{ minutes}$ 

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

Response 9:
To solve the problem, we need to convert the percentage to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, there are 480 minutes in an 8-hour workday. 

Action: Answer("72") 

To find out how many minutes Lani spent in meetings, we can set up a proportion: 

$\frac{\text{minutes in meetings}}{\text{total minutes in workday}} = \frac{15}{100}$ 

Cross-multiplying gives: 

$100 \cdot \text{minutes in meetings} = 15 \cdot 480$ 

Dividing both sides by 100 gives: 

$\text{minutes in meetings} = \frac{15 \cdot 480}{100} = 72$ 

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
The slope of the linear function represents the amount of monthly rental price increase for every one thousand dollars increase in the property's purchase price. We can calculate the slope by dividing the change in monthly rental price by the change in the purchase price: 

$\text{slope} = \dfrac{\text{change in } r}{\text{change in } p} = \dfrac{r_2 - r_1}{p_2 - p_1}$ 

We can use the data from any two properties to calculate the slope. Let's use the first and fourth properties: 

$\text{slope} = \dfrac{r_2 - r_1}{p_2 - p_1} = \dfrac{1040 - 950}{140 - 128} = \dfrac{90}{12} = 7.5$ 

This means that for every one thousand dollars increase in the property's purchase price, the monthly rental price increases by $7.5$ dollars. 

To find the y-intercept, we can substitute the slope and any point from the table into the point-slope form of a linear equation: 

$r - r_1 = m(p - p_1)$ 

Let's use the first property: 

$r - 950 = 7.5(p - 128)$ 

$r = 7.5p - 870$ 

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price and property purchase price is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 870$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ r(p)=2.5 p-870}$
Response 1:
The slope of the linear function can be calculated by finding the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. For example, for the property on Clearwater Lane, the slope is $\frac{950-515}{128-70} \approx 4.25$. We can do the same calculation for each property and take the average to get an estimate of the slope. Doing this, we get $\frac{4.25+4.75+4.25+4.75+4.25}{5} = 4.46$. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and D since their slopes are too different from the estimated slope. Now we just need to check which of the remaining choices passes through one of the points. For example, plugging in $p=128$ into choice B, we get $r(128)=5(128)+165=725$. Since the actual rental price is 950, we can eliminate choice B. Plugging in $p=140$ into choice C, we get $r(140)=6.5(140)+440=995$. This is close to the actual rental price of 1040, so we can choose choice C as the answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate of change of the rental price per unit change in the purchase price. The slope can be calculated as the ratio of the change in rental price to the change in purchase price between any two points on the line. For example, between Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive, the rental price increased by $1310-950=360$ dollars and the purchase price increased by $176-128=48$ thousand dollars. Thus, the slope is $360/48=7.5$. The $y$-intercept of the line represents the rental price when the purchase price is zero, which is not a meaningful quantity in this context. Therefore, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to write the function as $r(p)-950=7.5(p-128)$. Simplifying this expression gives $r(p)=7.5p-10$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
We need to find a linear function that relates the monthly rental price $r$ with the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars. We can assume that the function is of the form $r(p)=ap+b$, where $a$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. To find the slope $a$, we can use the formula $a=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\Delta r}{\Delta p}$, where $\Delta r$ is the change in monthly rental price and $\Delta p$ is the change in purchase price. We can choose any two points from the table to calculate the slope. For example, using the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, we have $\Delta r=1310-950=360$ and $\Delta p=176-128=48$. Therefore, $a=\frac{360}{48}=7.5$. To find the $y$-intercept $b$, we can use any point on the line. Using the point $(128, 950)$, we have $950=7.5(128)+b$, which gives $b=-10$. Therefore, the linear function is $r(p)=7.5p-10$, which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$.
Response 4:
The slope of the line that represents the linear function is equal to the ratio of the change in rental price to the change in purchase price between any two points on the line. If we choose two points $(p_1, r_1)$ and $(p_2, r_2)$ on the line, then the slope is given by: $$\frac{r_2-r_1}{p_2-p_1}$$We can choose the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$ from the table. The slope of the line passing through these two points is: $$\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=\frac{360}{48}=7.5$$Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is of the form $r(p)=7.5p+b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept of the line. We can use the point $(70, 515)$ to find $b$: $$515=7.5(70)+b$$Solving for $b$, we get $b=-10$. Therefore, the function that represents the relationship is: $$r(p)=7.5p-10$$Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$
Response 5:
We see that the slope of the line that relates the monthly rental price to the purchase price is the ratio of the change in rental price to the change in purchase price. For example, between the properties on Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive, the rental price increases by $1310-950=360$ dollars, while the purchase price increases by $176-128=48$ thousand dollars. Thus, the slope between these two points is $360/48=7.5$. We can check that this is true for the other pairs of points as well. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
The slope of a linear function is given by the formula $\text{slope}=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$. In this case, the rise is the change in monthly rental price, and the run is the change in purchase price. We can choose any two properties from the table to calculate the slope. Let's choose Clearwater Lane and Glenview Street. 
The rise is $1040-950=90$, and the run is $\frac{(140000-128000)}{1000}=12$. Therefore, the slope is $\frac{90}{12}=7.5$. 
The $y$-intercept represents the monthly rental price when the purchase price is $0$. Since this doesn't make sense in this context, we know that the $y$-intercept should be the monthly rental price when the purchase price is $0$ divided by $1000$, which is $0$ in this case.
Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price $r$ and purchase price $p$ is $r(p)=7.5p+0$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
To find the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$ and the property's purchase price $p$, we need to use the given information to find the slope and $y$-intercept of the function. The slope of a linear function is given by the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$. In this case, the change in $y$ is the change in monthly rental price, which is given by the difference between the rental prices of any two properties, and the change in $x$ is the change in purchase price, which is given by the difference between the purchase prices of the same two properties. For example, we can choose the properties on Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive to find the slope:

slope $= \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x} = \frac{1,310-950}{176-128} = 5$

So the slope of the linear function is 5. To find the $y$-intercept, we can choose any of the properties and substitute the values into the function. For example, we can choose the property on Edgemont Street:

$r(p) = 515$
$p = 70$

Substituting into the equation $r(p) = mp+b$, we get:

$515 = 5(70)+b$

Solving for $b$, we get:

$b = 165$

So the $y$-intercept of the linear function is 165. Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is:

$r(p) = 5p+165$

Answer: Answer(B)
Response 8:
We need to find a linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price. We can use the slope-intercept form of a linear function, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We can find the slope of the line by using two points from the table. Let's use Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive: 

- Clearwater Lane: $(128, 950)$
- Driftwood Drive: $(176, 1310)$

The change in the monthly rental price is $1310-950=360$, and the change in the purchase price is $176-128=48$. Therefore, the slope is $m=\frac{360}{48}=7.5$. 

To find the y-intercept, we can use any point from the table and the slope we just found. Let's use Edgemont Street: 

- Edgemont Street: $(70, 515)$

Substituting $p=70$ and $r=515$ into the slope-intercept form, we get: 

$515=7.5(70)+b$

Simplifying the right side, we get: 

$515=525+b$

Subtracting 525 from both sides, we get: 

$-10=b$

Therefore, the y-intercept is $b=-10$. 

Putting it all together, we get the linear function: 

$r(p)=7.5p-10$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ r(p)=7.5p-10}$
Response 9:
The slope of the line is the ratio of the change in $r$ to the change in $p$, so the slope is the change in rental price per $1000.  For example, the slope for the first property is $\frac{950-0}{128-0}=7.421875$.  The slope for the second property is $\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=7.6$.  The slope for the third property is $\frac{515-0}{70-0}=7.357142857$.  The slope for the fourth property is $\frac{1040-0}{140-0}=7.428571429$.  The slope for the fifth property is $\frac{3365-0}{450-0}=7.477777778$.  We see that the slopes are all very close to each other, so we can average them to get the slope of the line.  The average slope is $\frac{7.421875+7.6+7.357142857+7.428571429+7.477777778}{5}=7.457073213$.  We can now use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the line.  We use the point $(128,950)$, so $r-950=7.457073213(p-128)$.  Solving for $r$, we get $r=7.457073213p-870.1843374$.  Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } r(p)=2.5p-870}$.

Topic: Math
Question: Nate walks 25 meters in 13.7 seconds. If he walks at this same rate, which of the following is closest to the distance he will walk in 4 minutes?
Choices:
  A: 150 meters
  B: 450 meters
  C: 700 meters
  D: 1,400 meters
Response 0:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula:
distance = rate x time

First, we need to find Nate's rate:
rate = distance/time = 25 meters/13.7 seconds

Now, we can use this rate to find the distance he will walk in 4 minutes:
time = 4 minutes = 240 seconds
distance = rate x time = (25 meters/13.7 seconds) x 240 seconds

Simplifying, we get:
distance = 439.42 meters

This is closest to choice B: 450 meters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula:

distance = rate × time

We first need to find Nate's rate (or speed):

rate = distance/time

We know that he walks 25 meters in 13.7 seconds, so:

rate = 25/13.7 ≈ 1.82 m/s

Now we can use this rate to find the distance he will walk in 4 minutes (which is 240 seconds):

distance = rate × time = 1.82 × 240 ≈ 437 meters

So the closest answer choice is B: 450 meters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
To solve this problem, we can first find Nate's speed in meters per second by dividing the distance he walked by the time it took him: 

25 meters / 13.7 seconds = 1.82 meters per second

Next, we can use this speed to find the distance he will walk in 4 minutes (which is 240 seconds): 

1.82 meters per second x 240 seconds = 436.8 meters

So the closest answer choice is B: 450 meters. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time.

Action: Answer("C") 

First, we need to find Nate's rate:
rate = distance / time
rate = 25 meters / 13.7 seconds
rate ≈ 1.82 meters/second

Then, we can use this rate to find the distance he will walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds):
distance = rate x time
distance = 1.82 meters/second x 240 seconds
distance ≈ 436 meters

The closest answer choice to 436 meters is C: 700 meters.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: distance = rate × time

We need to convert 4 minutes to seconds, which is 4 × 60 = 240 seconds.

Nate's rate is: 25 meters ÷ 13.7 seconds = 1.82 meters per second

So, the distance Nate will walk in 4 minutes is:
distance = 1.82 meters/second × 240 seconds = 436.8 meters

The closest answer choice is B: 450 meters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
To solve this problem, we can use a proportion: 

25 meters / 13.7 seconds = x meters / 240 seconds

where x is the distance Nate will walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds). 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

25 * 240 = 13.7 * x

x = (25 * 240) / 13.7

x ≈ 437 meters

So the closest answer choice is B: 450 meters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
To solve the problem, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time. 

First, we need to find Nate's rate: 

rate = distance / time = 25 meters / 13.7 seconds

Next, we can use the rate to find the distance Nate will walk in 4 minutes: 

distance = rate x time = 1.82 meters per second x 240 seconds 

distance ≈ 436 meters

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& b=2.35+0.25 x \\& c=1.75+0.40 x\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ represent the price per pound, in dollars, of beef and chicken, respectively, $x$ weeks after July 1 during last summer. What was the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 2.60$
  B: $\$ 2.85$
  C: $\$ 2.95$
  D: $\$ 3.35$
Response 0:
We are given that $b=c$ and we need to solve for $b$. Substituting the given expressions for $b$ and $c$, we have: $$2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$$ Simplifying the equation, we get: $$0.15x=0.60 \Rightarrow x=4$$ Substituting $x=4$ in the expression for $b$, we get: $$b=2.35+0.25\times 4=2.35+1.00=3.35$$ Therefore, the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken was $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \$3.35}$.
Response 1:
We have $b=c$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
2.35+0.25x &= 1.75+0.40x \\
0.15x &= 0.60 \\
x &= 4
\end{aligned}
$$
So the price per pound of beef was $b=2.35+0.25\cdot 4=\$2.35+1.00=\$3.35$ when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
We need to set $b=c$ and solve for $x$ to find out when the prices are equal. $$\begin{aligned}2.35+0.25 x &= 1.75+0.40 x\\ 0.15x &= 0.6\\ x &= 4 \end{aligned}$$
So, the prices are equal 4 weeks after July 1. We can now substitute $x=4$ in any of the two equations to find the common price. $$\begin{aligned}b &= 2.35+0.25(4) = \$ 2.35+1.00 = \$ 3.35\\ c &= 1.75+0.40(4) = \$ 1.75+1.60 = \$ 3.35\end{aligned}$$
So, the common price is $\$ 3.35$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
We want to find the value of $x$ that makes $b=c$. So we substitute the expressions for $b$ and $c$ and solve for $x$: $$\begin{aligned}b&=c \\2.35+0.25 x&=1.75+0.40 x \\0.15 x&=0.6 \\x&=4\end{aligned}$$ Now we can substitute $x=4$ into either expression for $b$ or $c$ to find the common value: $$\begin{aligned}b&=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \$2.85} \\c&=1.75+0.40(4)=3.15\end{aligned}$$
Response 4:
We want to find the value of $x$ that makes $b=c$. So we have: $$\begin{aligned} 2.35+0.25 x &= 1.75+0.40 x \\ 0.15 x &= 0.60 \\ x &= 4 \end{aligned}$$ Now we can substitute $x=4$ into either equation to find the common price: $$\begin{aligned} b &= 2.35+0.25\cdot 4 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95} \\ c &= 1.75+0.40\cdot 4 = \$2.95 \end{aligned}$$
Response 5:
We need to find the value of $x$ such that $b=c$. Substituting the given expressions for $b$ and $c$ we get: $$2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x.$$Solving for $x$ we get $x=6$. Now substituting this value of $x$ in the expression for $b$ we get: $$b=2.35+0.25(6)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}.$$
Response 6:
We are given that $b=c$, so we can substitute the equations given and solve for $x$: $$\begin{aligned} 2.35+0.25 x &= 1.75+0.40 x \\ 0.10 x &= 0.60 \\ x &= 6 \end{aligned}$$ Now we can substitute this value of $x$ into either equation to find the price per pound of beef: $$b = 2.35+0.25(6) = 3.10$$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \$3.35}$.
Response 7:
We can set $b=c$ and solve for $x$ to find the week when the prices were equal. Then we can substitute that value of $x$ to either equation to find the price per pound. $$\begin{aligned} 2.35+0.25x &=1.75+0.40x\\0.15x&=0.60\\x&=4\end{aligned}$$Therefore, the prices were equal 4 weeks after July 1. Substituting $x=4$ into the equation for $b$, we get $$b=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \$2.85}.$$
Response 8:
We have $b=c$ when $2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$, so $0.15x=0.6$ and $x=4$. Substituting $x=4$ into the equation for $b$, we have $b=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$.
Response 9:
We need to find the value of $x$ for which $b=c$. Substituting the given expressions for $b$ and $c$, we get $2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$. Simplifying this equation, we get $0.15x=0.6$, which implies $x=4$. Substituting this value of $x$ into the expression for $b$, we get $b=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$.

Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
Response 0:
Let $A$ denote the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ denote the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never". Then, we want to find $P(A|B)$. Using Bayes' theorem, we have \begin{align*}
P(A|B) &= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\
&= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|\text{not }A)P(\text{not }A)}.
\end{align*}We are given that $P(A) = 0.309$, $P(\text{not }A) = 1-P(A) = 0.691$, $P(\text{Never}) = 0.313$, and $P(B|\text{Never}) = 0$. Using the law of total probability, we have $$P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\text{not }A)P(\text{not }A) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\text{not }A)(1-P(A)).$$We can solve for $P(B|A)$ and $P(B|\text{not }A)$ using the given information: \begin{align*}
P(B) &= P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\text{not }A)(1-P(A)) \\
0.687 &= P(B|A)(0.309) + P(B|\text{not }A)(0.691) \\
P(B|A) &= \frac{0.687 - P(B|\text{not }A)(0.691)}{0.309}.
\end{align*}Substituting this into the original expression, we get \begin{align*}
P(A|B) &= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|\text{not }A)P(\text{not }A)} \\
&= \frac{\frac{0.687 - P(B|\text{not }A)(0.691)}{0.309}(0.309)}{\frac{0.687 - P(B|\text{not }A)(0.691)}{0.309}(0.309)+P(B|\text{not }A)(0.691)} \\
&= \frac{0.687 - P(B|\text{not }A)(0.691)}{0.687 + 0.309P(B|\text{not }A)}.
\end{align*}We want to find $P(A|B)$ when $P(B|\text{Never}) = 0$. In other words, we want to find $P(B|\text{not }A)$. We know that $P(\text{Never}) = 0.313$ and $P(\text{Rarely}) = 0.243$, so $P(B|\text{not }A) = P(\text{Often}) + P(\text{Always}) = 0.135 + 0.309 = 0.444$. Substituting this into the expression we derived for $P(A|B)$, we get \begin{align*}
P(A|B) &= \frac{0.687 - 0.444(0.691)}{0.687 + 0.309(0.444)} \\
&= \frac{0.312}{0.818} \\
&\approx 0.381.
\end{align*}Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}$.
Response 1:
Let's call the event of a user answering "Always" as $A$ and the event of a user not answering "Never" as $B$. We want to find the conditional probability $P(A|B)$. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$We know that $P(A)=0.309$ and $P(B)=1-P(\text{Never})=1-0.313=0.687$. To find $P(B|A)$, we can use the fact that all users who answered "Always" also did not answer "Never", so $P(B|A)=1$. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:$$P(A|B)=\frac{1\cdot 0.309}{0.687}\approx 0.45$$Therefore, the closest answer choice is (C) 0.45. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B),$ which is equal to $\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.$ From the table, we see that $P(A)=0.309$ and $P(B)=1-0.313=0.687.$ Also, $P(A\cap B)=P(A)=0.309.$ Therefore, $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}=\frac{0.309}{0.687}\approx 0.45.$$ Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}.$
Response 3:
Let's call the event of a user answering "Always" as $A$ and the event of a user not answering "Never" as $B$. We want to find $P(A|B)$.

$B$ is the complement of the event "Never", so $P(B) = 1 - P(Never) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687$.

The table does not provide information on the joint probability $P(A \cap B)$, so we need to use Bayes' Theorem:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

We can estimate $P(A)$ from the table as $0.309$. To estimate $P(B|A)$, note that if a user answered "Always", then they definitely did not answer "Never". So $P(B|A) = 1$. 

Substituting all values into the formula, we get:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.45$$

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (C) 0.45. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B).$ Using Bayes' theorem, we have \begin{align*}
P(A|B) &= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\
&= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\text{not }A)P(\text{not }A)}.
\end{align*}We are given that $P(\text{not }A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.309 = 0.691.$ We can also find that $P(B|A) = 1$ since if a tablet user answered "Always," then they did not answer "Never." Finally, we can find $P(B|\text{not }A)$ using the information in the table. Since $31.3\%$ of tablet users answered "Never," we know that $100\% - 31.3\% = 68.7\%$ of tablet users did not answer "Never." Of those, $24.3\%$ answered "Rarely," $13.5\%$ answered "Often," and $30.9\%$ answered "Always." Therefore, $P(B|\text{not }A) = 0.687 - 0.313 = 0.374.$ Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get \begin{align*}
P(A|B) &= \frac{(1)(0.309)}{(1)(0.309) + (0.374)(0.691)} \\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}.
\end{align*}
Response 5:
Let's denote the event that a tablet user answered "Always" by $A$ and the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never" by $B$. Then we want to find $P(A|B)$, the probability that a tablet user answered "Always" given that the tablet user did not answer "Never". Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

We can calculate each of the terms on the right-hand side of the equation as follows:

- $P(A) = 0.309$, the percent of tablet users who answered "Always"
- $P(B|A) = 1$, since if a tablet user answered "Always", then they did not answer "Never"
- $P(B) = 1 - P(Never) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687$, the complement of the percent of tablet users who answered "Never"

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.45$$

Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}$.
Response 6:
Let's call the event of a tablet user answering "Always" as $A$ and the event of a tablet user not answering "Never" as $B$. We want to find $P(A|B)$, which is the probability of a tablet user answering "Always" given that they did not answer "Never". 

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

We know that $P(A) = 0.309$ from the table. To find $P(B)$, we need to add up the percentages of all the categories except "Never":

$$P(B) = 1 - P(\text{Never}) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687$$

To find $P(B|A)$, we need to look at the row for "Always" and see what percentage of those who answered "Always" did not answer "Never":

$$P(B|A) = \frac{\text{Percent of "Always" who did not answer "Never"}}{\text{Percent of all respondents who did not answer "Never"}} = \frac{0.309}{1 - 0.313} = 0.447$$

Putting it all together, we have:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{0.447 \times 0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.20$$

So the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0.31}$, but none of the answer choices are very close.
Response 7:
Let's call the event of a tablet user answering "Always" as $A$ and the event of a tablet user not answering "Never" as $B$. We want to find $P(A|B)$, the probability of $A$ given $B$. 

$B$ is the complement of the event "Never", so $B$ is the event of a tablet user answering "Rarely", "Often", or "Always". 

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

We know that $P(A) = 0.309$ and $P(B) = 1 - P(Never) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687$. 

To find $P(B|A)$, we need to look at the row of the table corresponding to "Always" and add up the percentages for "Rarely", "Often", and "Always". This gives us $P(B|A) = 0.135 + 0.309 = 0.444$.

Plugging in all the values, we get:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{0.444 \times 0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.199 \approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}$$
Response 8:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B),$ the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." 

The probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never" is $1-0.313=0.687.$ Out of these tablet users who did not answer "Never," the percentage who answered "Always" is $\frac{0.309}{0.687}\approx 0.449.$

Therefore, the closest choice to $P(A|B)$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}.$
Response 9:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $N$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Never." We want to find $P(A|N^c),$ the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never."
\begin{align*}
P(A|N^c) &= \frac{P(A\cap N^c)}{P(N^c)} \\
&= \frac{P(A)}{P(N^c)} \quad \text{since } A\cap N^c = A \\
&= \frac{0.309}{1-0.313} \quad \text{since } N^c = \text{not }N \\
&= \frac{0.309}{0.687} \\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}.

Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and the second equation by $-3$, then adding the two resulting equations together to eliminate $y$:

$$\begin{aligned} &(-2)(2x-3y=-14)\\&(-3)(3x-2y=-6)\\ \implies &-4x+6y=28\\&-9x+6y=18 \end{aligned}$$

Adding the two equations gives $-13x=46$, so $x=-\frac{46}{13}$. Substituting this value back into either of the original equations gives $y=-\frac{10}{13}$. Therefore, $x-y=-\frac{36}{13}$, which is approximately $-2.8$. The closest answer choice to this value is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ -8}$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B") 

To solve the system of equations, we can use elimination method.

Multiplying the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$, we get:

$$\begin{aligned}& 4 x-6 y=-28 \\& 9 x-6 y=-18\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

$$\begin{aligned} &-5x=-10 \\ &\implies x=2 \end{aligned}$$

Substituting $x=2$ in the first equation, we get:

$$\begin{aligned} 2(2)-3y&=-14 \\ \implies -3y&=-18 \\ \implies y&=6 \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, $(x,y)=(2,6)$ and $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and the second equation by $-3$ to get:
$$\begin{aligned}& -4x+6y=28 \\& -9x+6y=18\end{aligned}$$
Then, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate $y$:
$$5x=10 \Rightarrow x=2$$
Substituting $x=2$ into either of the original equations, we can solve for $y$:
$$2(2)-3y=-14 \Rightarrow y=8$$
Therefore, $x-y=2-8=-6$, which is answer choice $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ -4}$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can solve the system of equations using elimination method. Multiplying the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$, we get: 
$$\begin{aligned}& 4 x-6 y=-28 \\& 9 x-6 y=-18\end{aligned}$$
Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $-5x=-10$, which implies $x=2$. Substituting $x=2$ in the second equation, we get $3(2)-2y=-6$, which implies $y=6$. Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B") 

To solve the system of equations, we can use either elimination or substitution method. Using the elimination method, we can multiply the first equation by $3$ and the second equation by $2$, and then subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate $y$: 

$$\begin{aligned} &6x-9y=-42 \\&-6x+4y= -12 \\ \end{aligned}$$

Adding the two equations above, we have $-5y=-54$, which gives us $y=10.8$. Substituting $y=10.8$ into the first equation, we have $2x-3(10.8)=-14$, which gives us $x=5.4$. Therefore, $x-y=5.4-10.8=-5.4=-8+(-4)/10=\boxed{-8}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-3$ and the second equation by $2$, and then adding the resulting equations to eliminate $y$: 

$$\begin{aligned} &-6x+9y=42 \\ &+6x-4y=-12 \\ &\hline \\ &5y=30 \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, $y=6$. Substituting this value into the first equation, we get $2x-3(6)=-14$, which gives $x=2$. Thus, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve the system of equations, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, and then add the resulting equations to eliminate $y$: 

$$\begin{aligned} &4x-6y=-28 \\&9x-6y=-18 \end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation gives $5x=10$, so $x=2$. Substituting $x=2$ into the second equation gives $3(2)-2y=-6$, so $y=6$. Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-3$ and the second equation by $-2$ to get:

$$\begin{aligned}&-6x+9y=42\\&-6x+4y=12\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $5y=30$, so $y=6$. Substituting this value of $y$ into either equation, we can solve for $x$:

$$2x-3(6)=-14 \Rightarrow x=2$$

Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ -4}$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B") 

To solve the system of equations, we can multiply the first equation by $-2$ and the second equation by $-3$ and then add the two equations together, which gives us $x-y=-8$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("D") 

Solving the system of equations, we get $x=0$ and $y=2$. Therefore, $x-y=0-2=-2$. However, we are looking for $x-y$ and not $y-x$, so we have $x-y=-(-2)=\boxed{2}$.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 0:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 

The amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{1}{4}-x$ (because Jennifer uses $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal per serving). 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from Crunchy Grain cereal and the calories from Super Grain cereal: 

\begin{align*}
&\text{Calories from Crunchy Grain cereal} = \frac{3}{4}\text{cup} \cdot \frac{210\text{ calories}}{\text{serving}} \cdot \frac{1\text{ serving}}{1\text{ cup}} = 157.5\text{ calories} \\
&\text{Calories from Super Grain cereal} = x\text{cup} \cdot \frac{240\text{ calories}}{\text{cup}} = 240x\text{ calories} \\
&\text{Total calories} = 157.5\text{ calories} + 240x\text{ calories} = 270\text{ calories}
\end{align*}

Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{1}{4}$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 1:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 

The total number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}=280$ calories. 

So the total number of calories from Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $270-280=-10$ calories. 

Since Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup, we have $\frac{-10}{240}=-\frac{1}{24}$ cup of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's say Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. This means she is using $(1-x)$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

From the information given in the problem, we know that the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270. We can use this information to create an equation: 

$240x + 210(1-x) = 270$

Simplifying the equation gives: 

$240x + 210 - 210x = 270$

$30x = 60$

$x = 2/3$

So Jennifer is using $\frac{2}{3}$ cups of Super Grain cereal and $\frac{1}{3}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

To check that this is correct, we can calculate the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture: 

$240 \cdot \frac{2}{3} + 210 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 160 + 70 = 230$

This is not exactly 270, but it is close. We can see that we need slightly more Super Grain cereal to get to 270 calories. 

To get 270 calories, we need: 

$240x + 210(1-x) = 270$

$240x + 210 - 210x = 270$

$30x = 60$

$x = 2/3 + 1/6 = 5/6$

So Jennifer needs to use $\frac{5}{6}$ cups of Super Grain cereal and $\frac{1}{6}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal to get a total of 270 calories in one cup of the mixture. 

To find how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture, we need to divide $\frac{5}{6}$ cups by the total amount of cereal, which is $\frac{5}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = 1$ cup: 

$\frac{\frac{5}{6}}{1} = \frac{5}{6}$

So $\frac{5}{6}$ cups of the mixture is Super Grain cereal. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. The amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x$. We can set up the equation:
\begin{align*}
240x+210\left(1-x\right)&=270 \\
240x+210-210x&=270 \\
30x&=60 \\
x&=2/4=1/2
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{2}\text{ cup}}$.
Response 4:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x$. Since the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, we can write the equation: $$240x+210\left(1-x\right)=270.$$ Solving for $x$, we get $x=\frac{3}{4}$. Therefore, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 5:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal (in cups) in one cup of the mixture. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal (in cups) in one cup of the mixture is $1-x$. Since the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, we have the equation $240x+210(1-x)=270$, which simplifies to $30x=60$. Therefore, $x=2/3$. So, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 6:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $y$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

We know that Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup, so $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal will provide $240x$ calories. 

We also know that Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup. To find out how many calories are in one cup of Crunchy Grain cereal, we can use the following proportion: 

$\frac{210 \text{ calories}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup}} = \frac{x \text{ calories}}{1 \text{ cup}}$

Simplifying this proportion, we get:

$x = 280$

So one cup of Jennifer's mixture contains $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $y$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal to get one cup of the mixture.
Then, we can write two equations based on the given information:
Equation 1: $240x + 210y = 270$ (total calories in one cup of the mixture)
Equation 2: $\frac{180}{0.05} = 3600$ milligrams of potassium is the daily allowance for adults.
Since one serving of Crunchy Grain cereal provides $180$ milligrams of potassium, Jennifer can have at most $\frac{3600}{180} = 20$ servings of Crunchy Grain cereal per day. Therefore, the total amount of cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{3}{4} \operatorname{cup} + x \operatorname{cup} \leq \frac{20}{4} \operatorname{cup} = 5 \operatorname{cups}$.
Solving Equation 1 for $x$, we get $x = \frac{3}{8} - \frac{7}{16}y$. Substituting this into the inequality above, we get $\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{16}y \leq 5$, which implies $y \geq \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$.
Therefore, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $x = \frac{3}{8} - \frac{7}{16}y = \frac{3}{8} - \frac{7}{16} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture, measured in cups. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x$. We can set up the following equation based on the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture: 

$240x + 210\left(1-x\right) = 270$

Solving for $x$ gives:

$x = \frac{3}{8}$

Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{3}{8}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{5}{8}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

To check, we can calculate the total amount of calories in one cup of the mixture: 

$240\left(\frac{3}{8}\right) + 210\left(\frac{5}{8}\right) = 270$

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $y$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 
We are given that a serving size of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories. Therefore, $y$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal will provide $210 \times \frac{4}{3}y = 280y$ calories. 
We are also given that each serving of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 50 calories from fat. Therefore, $y$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal will provide $50 \times \frac{4}{3}y = \frac{200}{3}y$ calories from fat. 
We know that the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270. Therefore, we can write the following equation:
\begin{align*}
240x + 280y &= 270(x+y) \\
\Rightarrow 240x + 280y &= 270x + 270y \\
\Rightarrow 10x &= -10y \\
\Rightarrow x &= -y
\end{align*}
Since we cannot have a negative amount of cereal, we can conclude that $y= \frac{1}{3}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal and $x = -\frac{1}{3}$ cup of Super Grain cereal. 
Therefore, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $-\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{240}{30} = -\frac{8}{3}$ calories. 
Since we cannot have a negative amount of cereal, we can conclude that Jennifer must mix $\frac{1}{3}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{1}{3}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal to get a total of 270 calories in one cup of the mixture.

Topic: Math
Question: $$-2 x+3 y=6$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of which of the following equations is perpendicular to the graph of the equation above?
Choices:
  A: $3 x+2 y=6$
  B: $3 x+4 y=6$
  C: $2 x+4 y=6$
  D: $2 x+6 y=3$
Response 0:
To solve the problem, we need to find the slope of the given equation. Rearranging the equation in slope-intercept form, we get: $$y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$$The slope of this equation is $\frac{2}{3}$. 

The equation perpendicular to this line must have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. The negative reciprocal is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Now we can check which equation has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To find the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line, we need to take the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. 

The given equation $-2x+3y=6$ can be written in slope-intercept form as $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. Therefore, the slope of the given line is $\frac{2}{3}$. 

The line perpendicular to this line will have a slope of $-\frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}}=-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Now we need to find which of the answer choices has a line with a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

A: $3x+2y=6$ can be written in slope-intercept form as $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$. This line is perpendicular to the given line, so the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
To solve this problem, we need to find the slope of the given equation and then find the equation with the negative reciprocal slope. 

Action: Solve the given equation for y: $$-2 x+3 y=6$$

$$3 y=2 x+6$$

$$y=\frac{2}{3} x+2$$

So, the slope of the given equation is $\frac{2}{3}$. The equation that is perpendicular to this equation will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$.

Action: Find the equation whose slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$:

The equation with slope $-\frac{3}{2}$ has the form $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+b$, where $b$ is a constant. To find $b$, we need to use the fact that the line passes through the point $(0, c)$, where $c$ is the $y$-intercept.

So, we have:

$$c=-\frac{3}{2}(0)+b$$

$$c=b$$

Therefore, the equation we are looking for is $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+c$, where $c$ is the $y$-intercept.

Now, we need to check which of the given equations has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$.

Action: Check the slope of each equation:

A: $3 x+2 y=6$

$$2 y=-3 x+6$$

$$y=-\frac{3}{2} x+3$$

The slope of this equation is $-\frac{3}{2}$, so it is perpendicular to the given equation.

B: $3 x+4 y=6$

$$4 y=-3 x+6$$

$$y=-\frac{3}{4} x+\frac{3}{2}$$

The slope of this equation is $-\frac{3}{4}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given equation.

C: $2 x+4 y=6$

$$4 y=-2 x+6$$

$$y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{3}{2}$$

The slope of this equation is $-\frac{1}{2}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given equation.

D: $2 x+6 y=3$

$$6 y=-2 x+3$$

$$y=-\frac{1}{3} x+\frac{1}{2}$$

The slope of this equation is $-\frac{1}{3}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given equation.

Therefore, the answer is A: $3 x+2 y=6$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
To find the equation that is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find the slope of the given equation. The slope of the given equation is $$-\frac{-2}{3}=\frac{2}{3}.$$ The slope of a line perpendicular to this line would be the negative reciprocal of this slope, which is $$-\frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}}=-\frac{3}{2}.$$ 

Therefore, the equation that is perpendicular to the given equation must have a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$. The only equation that has this slope is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2x+4y=6}.$
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
To find the equation that is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find the slope of the given equation. 

Slope of the given equation: 

$$-2 x+3 y=6$$
$$3y = 2x + 6$$
$$y = \frac{2}{3}x + 2$$

So, the slope of the given equation is $\frac{2}{3}$.

The slope of a line perpendicular to this line will be the negative reciprocal of this slope. 

So, the slope of the line perpendicular to the given equation is $-\frac{3}{2}$.

Now, let's check the slope of each equation given in the choices:

A: $3 x+2 y=6$
$$2y = -3x + 6$$
$$y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3$$
The slope of this equation is $-\frac{3}{2}$, which is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given equation. So, A is perpendicular to the given equation.

B: $3 x+4 y=6$
$$4y = -3x + 6$$
$$y = -\frac{3}{4}x + \frac{3}{4}$$
The slope of this equation is $-\frac{3}{4}$, which is not the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given equation. So, B is not perpendicular to the given equation.

C: $2 x+4 y=6$
$$4y = -2x + 6$$
$$y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3}{4}$$
The slope of this equation is $-\frac{1}{2}$, which is not the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given equation. So, C is not perpendicular to the given equation.

D: $2 x+6 y=3$
$$6y = -2x + 3$$
$$y = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{2}$$
The slope of this equation is $-\frac{1}{3}$, which is not the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given equation. So, D is not perpendicular to the given equation.

Therefore, the equation that is perpendicular to the given equation is A. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
To find the equation that is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find the slope of the given equation first. 

The given equation is $-2x+3y=6$ which can be written as $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. So, the slope of the given equation is $\frac{2}{3}$.

The line perpendicular to this line will have a slope which is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$.

Now, let's check which of the given equations has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$.

A: $3x+2y=6$ can be written as $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$. The slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$, so this equation is perpendicular to the given equation.

B: $3x+4y=6$ can be written as $y=-\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{3}{2}$. The slope is $-\frac{3}{4}$, so this equation is not perpendicular to the given equation.

C: $2x+4y=6$ can be written as $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$. The slope is $-\frac{1}{2}$, so this equation is not perpendicular to the given equation.

D: $2x+6y=3$ can be written as $y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$. The slope is $-\frac{1}{3}$, so this equation is not perpendicular to the given equation.

Therefore, the answer is (A) $3x+2y=6$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
To find the slope of the given equation, we can rearrange it in slope-intercept form: $$y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$$
The slope of this equation is $\frac{2}{3}$. 
For two lines to be perpendicular, their slopes must multiply to give $-1$. Thus, we need to find an equation with a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
To solve this problem, we need to find the slope of the given equation. The slope of the given equation is $m=-\frac{-2}{3}=\frac{2}{3}$. The slope of a line perpendicular to this line will be the negative reciprocal of this slope, which is $-\frac{3}{2}$. Now, we need to check which equation has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$.

We can solve this problem using determinants. If we write the system of equations in matrix form as $AX=B$, where $A$ is the coefficient matrix, $X$ is the variable matrix, and $B$ is the constant matrix, then the system has no solution if and only if $\det(A)=0$. 

$$\begin{aligned} \begin{vmatrix} k & -3 \\ 4 & -5 \end{vmatrix} &= k(-5)-(-3)(4) \\ &= -5k+12 \end{aligned}$$

So the system has no solution if $-5k+12=0$, which occurs when $k=\boxed{\frac{12}{5}}$.

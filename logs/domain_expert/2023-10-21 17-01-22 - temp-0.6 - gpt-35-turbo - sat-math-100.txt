Question: A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 10,800$
  B: $\$ 16,200$
  C: $\$ 21,600$
  D: $\$ 29,700$

Action: Answer("B")

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Solution: 

Since the equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate, we can model its value $V$ (in dollars) as a linear function of time $t$ (in years) with an initial value of $V_0 = 32,400$ and a final value of $V_f = 0$ after 12 years. Thus, we have the equation:

$$V = V_0 - \frac{V_0 - V_f}{12} t = 32,400 - \frac{32,400 - 0}{12} t = 32,400 - 2,700 t$$

To find the value of the equipment 4 years after it is purchased, we substitute $t=4$ into the equation:

$$V = 32,400 - 2,700 \cdot 4 = 21,600$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$ 21,600$.
Response 4:
We can solve the problem using linear depreciation, where the value of the equipment decreases by the same amount each year. 

The initial value of the equipment is $\$ 32,400$, and it depreciates over 12 years. Therefore, the yearly depreciation is:

$\frac{\$ 32,400}{12 \text{ years}} = \$ 2,700 \text{ per year}$

After 4 years, the equipment has depreciated by:

$4 \text{ years} \cdot \$ 2,700 \text{ per year} = \$ 10,800$

So the current value of the equipment is:

$\$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 = \$ 21,600$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$ 21,600$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B") 

Solution: 

Since the equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate, we can model this situation with a linear function. Let $y$ be the value of the equipment in dollars and $x$ be the number of years that have passed since it was purchased. Then, we can write the following equation:

$y = mx + b$

where $m$ is the slope of the line (the rate of depreciation) and $b$ is the $y$-intercept (the initial value of the equipment).

We know that the equipment is worth $\$ 32,400$ when it is purchased, so we have the point $(0, 32400)$ on the line. We also know that the equipment is considered to have no value after 12 years, so we have the point $(12, 0)$ on the line. Therefore, we can find the slope of the line as follows:

$m = \frac{0 - 32400}{12 - 0} = -2700$

Substituting the slope and the point $(0, 32400)$ into the equation $y = mx + b$, we can solve for $b$:

$32400 = (-2700)(0) + b$

$b = 32400$

So the equation of the line is:

$y = -2700x + 32400$

To find the value of the equipment 4 years after it is purchased, we can substitute $x = 4$ into the equation:

$y = -2700(4) + 32400 = 21600$

Therefore, the equipment is worth $\$ 21,600$ 4 years after it is purchased.
Response 6:
Let's use straight-line depreciation method for this question. Each year, the equipment depreciates by the same amount. 

The total depreciation over the 12 years is $\$32,400 - \$0 = \$32,400$. 

So, the yearly depreciation is $\frac{\$32,400}{12 \text{ years}} = \$2,700$.

After 4 years, the equipment would have depreciated by $4 \times \$2,700 = \$10,800$. 

Therefore, the equipment is worth $\$32,400 - \$10,800 = \$21,600$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let the value of the equipment after $4$ years be $x$. 

The equipment depreciates at a constant rate, which means that the value decreases by the same amount each year. 

After $12$ years, the equipment has no monetary value, so we can set up the equation:

$32400 - 12x = 0$

Solving for $x$, we get $x = 2700$.

So after $4$ years, the equipment is worth:

$32400 - 4x = 32400 - 4(2700) = 21600$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$21,600}$.
Response 8:
Since the equipment depreciates at a constant rate, we can use straight-line depreciation to determine how much it depreciates in value each year. Straight-line depreciation means that the equipment loses an equal amount of value each year. 

The initial value of the equipment is $\$ 32,400$, and it depreciates over 12 years. Therefore, the equipment depreciates by $\frac{\$ 32,400}{12} = \$ 2,700$ per year. 

After 4 years, the equipment has depreciated by $4 \times \$2,700 = \$10,800$. Therefore, the equipment is worth $\$32,400 - \$10,800 = \$21,600$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
The equipment depreciates at a constant rate for 12 years. Therefore, the equipment depreciates $\frac{\$ 32,400}{12} = \$ 2,700$ per year. After 4 years, the equipment would have depreciated by $4 \times \$ 2,700 = \$ 10,800$. Therefore, the equipment would be worth $\$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 = \$ 21,600.$

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cylindrical can containing pieces of fruit is filled to the top with syrup before being sealed. The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. If $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, which of the following is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can?
Choices:
  A: $7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  B: $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  C: $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  D: $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 0:
Let's first find the volume of the cylinder. We know that the area of the base is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and the height is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, so the volume is given by:

$V_{\text{cylinder}} = \text{area of base} \times \text{height} = 75 \times 10 = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

However, we also know that the syrup takes up $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of the total volume. Therefore, the volume of the fruit pieces is:

$V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} - V_{\text{syrup}} = 750 - 110 = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

So the answer is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
Response 1:
Let's first find the volume of the cylinder using the given information. We have the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so its radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. The height of the cylinder is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is approximately $\pi (4.33)^2 (10) \approx 594.6 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the fruit in the can is the difference between the volume of the cylinder and the volume of the syrup: $594.6 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 484.6 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$ is the closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can.
Response 2:
Let's begin by finding the volume of the cylinder. The volume of the cylinder can be calculated as follows:
$$V_{cylinder} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height} = 75\text{~cm}^{2} \times 10\text{~cm} = 750\text{~cm}^{3}$$
Since the syrup fills the can to the top, the total volume of the syrup and fruit together is $750\text{~cm}^{3}$. We are told that $110\text{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed, so the volume of the fruit is:
$$V_{fruit} = 750\text{~cm}^{3} - 110\text{~cm}^{3} = 640\text{~cm}^{3}$$
Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, $V = \pi r^{2}h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We know that the area of the base is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so we can solve for the radius: 

\begin{align*}
A &= \pi r^{2} \\
75 &= \pi r^{2} \\
r^{2} &= \frac{75}{\pi} \\
r &\approx 4.04 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{align*}

Using the given height of $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, we can calculate the total volume of the can:

\begin{align*}
V_{\text{can}} &= \pi r^{2}h \\
&= \pi (4.04 \mathrm{~cm})^{2} (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \\
&\approx 509 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}
\end{align*}

We know that it took $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup to fill the can to the top, so the volume of the fruit must be:

\begin{align*}
V_{\text{fruit}} &= V_{\text{can}} - V_{\text{syrup}} \\
&= 509 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \\
&= 399 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 4:
First, we can find the volume of the cylinder using the formula $V = \pi r^{2} h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the area of the base is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Plugging this in with the height of $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, we get a volume of $V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^{2} (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

The volume of the syrup is given as $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, so the volume of the fruit must be $V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 481 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Finally, we need to convert this volume to an amount of fruit. Since the fruit is not a liquid, we cannot assume that the volume of the fruit is equal to the volume of the space it occupies. However, we can make a reasonable estimate by assuming that the fruit is roughly spherical in shape and packing together as tightly as possible. In this case, the fruit will occupy about 74% of the volume it fills. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is approximately $\frac{481}{0.74} \approx 651 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
We can start by calculating the volume of the cylinder using the given formula $V = Bh$ where $B$ is the base area and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. Substituting the given values, we get $V = (75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2})(10 \mathrm{~cm}) = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

We know that the volume of the syrup added is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is the difference between the volume of the cylinder and the volume of the syrup. Thus, the volume of the fruit is $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's start by calculating the volume of the can using the given values. 
The formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. 
We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. 
The height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. 
Using these values, we can calculate the volume of the can as $V_{can} = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 592.45 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

We are also given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. This volume includes the volume of the fruit and the empty spaces between the fruit. So, the volume of the fruit is $V_{fruit} = V_{can} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 482.45 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Therefore, the answer is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$, which is the only choice that is greater than $482.45 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
Response 7:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^{2} h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Since we know the area of the base is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, we can find the radius by taking the square root of the area and dividing by $\pi$: $r = \sqrt{75/\pi}$. Plugging in the values we have: $V = \pi (\sqrt{75/\pi})^{2} \times 10 = 750\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Now, we can subtract the volume of the syrup from the total volume to find the volume of the fruit: $750 - 110 = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Therefore, the answer is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's begin by finding the volume of the can. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, the radius of the base is $\sqrt{75/(\pi)} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $\pi (\sqrt{75/(\pi)})^{2} (10) = 750\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the remaining volume inside the can is $750-110=640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. This remaining volume is the sum of the volume of the fruit and the air pockets between the fruit. Since the fruit is packed tightly, we can assume that the air pockets are negligible. Therefore, the total volume of the fruit is approximately $640\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylindrical can using the given information. 

Volume of the cylindrical can = Base area x Height = $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \times 10 \mathrm{~cm} = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the remaining volume must be occupied by the fruit. 

Volume of fruit = Total volume - Volume of syrup = $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If $2 w+4 t=14$ and $4 w+5 t=25$, what is the value of $2 w+3 t ?$
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 10
  C: 13
  D: 17
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation. This gives us $w+t=3$, so $2w+3t=2(w+t)+t=2(3)+t=6+t$. Therefore, $2w+3t=\boxed{13}$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this problem by using elimination method. Multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation, we get $w + t = 3$. Subtracting $w + t = 3$ from $4w + 5t = 25$, we get $3w + 4t = 22$. Multiplying $2w + 4t = 14$ by 3 and subtracting $3w + 4t = 22$, we get $2w + 3t = 4$. Therefore, the answer is $2w + 3t = 4 + (w + t) = 4 + 3 = 7$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation to eliminate $w$: 

$(4w+5t)-(4w+8t)=25-28 \Rightarrow t=-1.$ 

Substituting $t=-1$ in the first equation gives $2w+4(-1)=14,$ so $w=9.$ Thus, $2w+3t=2(9)+3(-1)=\boxed{13}.$
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and then adding the two equations together to eliminate $w:$
\begin{align*}
-2(2w+4t)&=-2\cdot 14\\
\Rightarrow \qquad -4w-8t&=-28\\
\qquad 4w+5t&=25\\
\hline
\Rightarrow \qquad \qquad -3t &= -3\\
\Rightarrow \qquad \qquad t &= 1
\end{align*}
Now we can substitute this value of $t$ into either of the original equations to solve for $w:$
\begin{align*}
2w+4(1)&=14\\
\Rightarrow \qquad 2w&=10\\
\Rightarrow \qquad w&=5
\end{align*}
Finally, we can substitute these values of $w$ and $t$ into $2w+3t$ to get:
$$2w+3t=2(5)+3(1)=13$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }13}.$
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve this problem, we can use elimination method. Multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by -1, we get $4w+8t=28$ and $-4w-5t=-25$. Adding these two equations, we get $3t=3$, so $t=1$. Substituting $t=1$ in the first equation, we get $2w+4=14$, so $w=5$. Therefore, $2w+3t=2(5)+3(1)=13$. Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 13}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation to eliminate $w$. This gives us $-7t = -3$, so $t = \frac{3}{7}$. Substituting this value into the first equation, we get $w = \frac{7}{2} - 2t = \frac{7}{2} - 2\cdot\frac{3}{7} = \frac{13}{7}$. Finally, $2w + 3t = 2\cdot\frac{13}{7} + 3\cdot\frac{3}{7} = \frac{26+9}{7} = \frac{35}{7} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 13}$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")  

First, we can find the value of $w$ by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation. This gives us $w=3$. 
Then, we can substitute $w=3$ into the first equation and solve for $t$. This gives us $t=1$. 
Finally, we can substitute $w=3$ and $t=1$ into $2w+3t$ and get $2(3)+3(1)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 13}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this problem by using elimination method. If we multiply the first equation by $-2$, we get $-4w-8t=-28$. If we add this equation to the second equation, we get $4w+5t-4w-8t=25-28$, which simplifies to $-3t=-3$. Therefore, $t=1$. Substituting this value in the first equation gives $2w+4=14$, or $2w=10$, which implies $w=5$. Finally, $2w+3t=2(5)+3(1)=13$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation. This will eliminate $w$ and give us the value of $t.$ Then we can substitute this value of $t$ into either equation to find the value of $w.$

Multiplying the first equation by $-2,$ we get $-4w-8t=-28.$ Adding this to the second equation $4w+5t=25,$ we get $-3t=-3$ or $t=1.$ Substituting $t=1$ into the first equation $2w+4t=14,$ we get $2w+4=14$ or $2w=10$ or $w=5.$ Finally, substituting $t=1$ and $w=5$ into $2w+3t,$ we get $2(5)+3(1)=13.$
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation to get $t=3$. Substituting this value of $t$ into the first equation gives $w=4$. Therefore, $2w+3t=2(4)+3(3)=8+9=13$.

Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")  

Solution: 
Expanding the left side we get:
$$5ax^3 - abx^2 + 20ax^2 - 3bx + 15x^2 + 12ax + 12 = 20x^3 - 9x^2 - 2x + 12$$
Equating the coefficients of $x^3$ on both sides, we get:
$$5a = 20 \Rightarrow a = 4$$
Equating the coefficients of $x^2$ on both sides, we get:
$$-ab + 20a + 15 = -9 \Rightarrow -4b + 80 + 15 = -9 \Rightarrow b = \frac{86}{4} = 21.5$$
Therefore, $ab = 4 \times 21.5 = 86$, which corresponds to the answer C.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A") 

We can start by expanding the left side of the equation and grouping like terms with the right side of the equation to get:

$$5ax^3 + (12-5b)x^2 + (12-4ab)x + 12 = 20x^3 - 9x^2 - 2x + 12$$

Equating the coefficients of the corresponding powers of $x$ gives us:

$$\begin{cases} 5a = 20 \\ 12-5b = -9 \\ 12-4ab = -2 \end{cases}$$

Solving for $a$ and $b$ gives us $a=4$ and $b=-3$. Therefore, $ab = (4)(-3) = -12$. However, the answer choices do not include a negative value, so we select the positive value that is closest to it, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 18}$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A") 

We can simplify both sides of the equation and then equate the coefficients of the corresponding terms. Doing so, we get:

$5a = 20 \implies a = 4$

$12-3b = 0 \implies b = 4$

Therefore, $ab = 4 \cdot 4 = 16$. 

So, the answer is A: 18.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can find the value of $a$ by expanding the left-hand side of the given equation and comparing it to the right-hand side:
$$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$
$$5a x^3+(12-5ab) x^2+(12-4b) x+12a=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$
Comparing coefficients of the terms with the same degree, we get:
$$5a=20\implies a=4$$
$$12-5ab=-9\implies 20-5b=-9\implies b=\frac{29}{5}$$
Therefore, $a b = 4 \cdot \frac{29}{5} = 20$.

  A: $(a+2 b)^{2}$
  B: $(2 a+2 b)^{2}$
  C: $(4 a+4 b)^{2}$
  D: $(4 a+8 b)^{2}$
Response 0:
We can simplify $4z+8y$ as $4(a^2+b^2)+8(ab)$. 

This can be further simplified as $4a^2+4b^2+8ab$. 

We can factor this using the identity $a^2+2ab+b^2=(a+b)^2$. 

Thus, $4a^2+4b^2+8ab=4(a^2+2ab+b^2)=4(a+b)^2$.

Therefore, the answer is $(a+ b)^2$ which is equivalent to choice B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
We can simplify $4z+8y$ by substituting $z=a^2+b^2$ and $y=ab$:

$4z+8y=4(a^2+b^2)+8(ab)$

$=4a^2+4b^2+8ab+4ab+4b^2$

$=4a^2+8ab+8b^2$

Expanding $(a+2b)^2$ gives $a^2+4ab+4b^2$. Substituting $y$ for $ab$ gives $a^2+4y+4b^2$, which is equivalent to $z+4y$.  
Adding $4z$ gives $4z+4y$, which simplifies to $4(z+y)$.  
Therefore, Answer("None of the Above") since none of the given choices are equivalent.
Response 6:
We can simplify $4z+8y$ as $4(a^2+b^2)+8(ab)$. Factoring out a 4, we have $4(a^2+2ab+b^2)$. Notice that $a^2+2ab+b^2$ is a perfect square and can be factored as $(a+b)^2$. Thus, $4z+8y=4(a+b)^2$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
We can start by factoring 4 out of the expression $4z+8y$ to get $4(z+2y)$. We know that $z=a^{2}+b^{2}$ and $y=ab$ so we can substitute these into the expression to get $4(a^{2}+b^{2}+2ab)$. This can be simplified as $4(a+b)^{2}$. Therefore, the answer is (C) $(4a+4b)^2$.

The function $f(x)$ is linear and passes through two points $(5,16.94)$ and $(40,51.59)$. The slope of the line is $\frac{51.59-16.94}{40-5}=0.99$. So, the equation of the line is $f(x)=0.99x+b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Plugging in the point $(5,16.94)$ gives $16.94=0.99(5)+b$, so $b=11.99$. Thus, the function is $f(x)=0.99x+11.99$.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $a$ & $3 a$ & $5 a$ \\\hline$y$ & 0 & $-a$ & $-2 a$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$ are shown in the table above, where $a$ is a constant. If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $x+2 y=a$
  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
Response 0:
We can use the values in the table to form a system of linear equations. For example, using the first two rows of the table, we have the equations $a+0\cdot b=0$ and $3a+(-a)\cdot b=0$, which simplify to $a=0$ and $2a=0$, respectively. Since $a=0$, we can use the third row of the table to check our work: $5a+(-2a)\cdot b=-2a$, which should equal $0$ if $a=0$. Thus, $b=2.5$. We can now use $a=0$ and $b=2.5$ to check which equation is satisfied by all the values in the table. Plugging in $x=a$ and $y=0$ gives $a+2\cdot 0\cdot b=a$, which is true. Plugging in $x=3a$ and $y=-a$ gives $3a+2\cdot (-a)\cdot b=5a$, which is also true. Finally, plugging in $x=5a$ and $y=-2a$ gives $5a+2\cdot (-2a)\cdot b=-7a$, which is not true. Therefore, the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ is given by $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ x+2y=5a}$.
Response 1:
Substitute the given values of $x$ and $y$ into the equation $ax+by=c$ to find out which equation is true.

\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
a+0b&=c \\
3a+(-a)b&=c \\
5a+(-2a)b&=c \\
\end{cases}
&\implies
\begin{cases}
a&=c \\
2a&=c \\
-a&=c \\
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

Since $a$ is a non-zero constant, the only equation that holds for all three values is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }x+2y=5a}$.
Response 2:
We can start by finding the slope of the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$. We can see that if we increase $x$ by $2a$, then we decrease $y$ by $a$. So, the slope is $\frac{-a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}$. 

Next, we need to find the $y$-intercept. We can see that when $x=5a$, $y=-2a$. So, the $y$-intercept is $-2a$. 

Therefore, the equation of the linear relationship is $y=-\frac{1}{2}x-2a$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
We can use the method of finding the equation of a line given two points. Here, we have three points $(a,0)$, $(3a,-a)$, and $(5a,-2a)$ on the line. Using the first two points, we find that the slope of the line is $$\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-\frac{a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}.$$ Using the second and third points, we get the same slope. Therefore, the equation of the line is of the form $$y=mx+b,$$ where $m=-\frac{1}{2}$ is the slope. Plugging in the coordinates of the point $(a,0)$, we get $$0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b.$$ Solving for $b$, we find $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $$y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{a}{2}.$$ Multiplying both sides by $-2$, we get $$2y=x-a.$$ Adding $5a$ to both sides, we get $$2y+5a=x.$$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ x+2y=5a}.$
Response 4:
We can use the given table to form three equations: \begin{align*}
a&=0+2(0)\\
3a&=-a+2(-a)\\
5a&=-2a+2(-2a)
\end{align*}Simplifying, we have $a=0$, $5a=-3a$, and $9a=-4a$. Thus, $a=0$ and the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $x+2y=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 5a}$.
Response 5:
We can write the relationship as $y=mx+b$. From the table, we can see that when $x=a$, $y=0$. Substituting these values, we get $0=a\cdot m+b$. When $x=3a$, $y=-a$, so $-a=3a\cdot m+b$. When $x=5a$, $y=-2a$, so $-2a=5a\cdot m+b$. We can use the first equation to solve for $b$ in terms of $m$: $b=-am$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $-a=3am-am^2$. Simplifying, we get $am^2-4am+a=0$. We can factor this to get $a(m-1)(am-1)=0$. Since $a\neq 0$, we have $m=1$ or $m=\frac{1}{a}$. If $m=1$, then substituting into the third equation gives $2x-y=7a$. If $m=\frac{1}{a}$, then substituting into the third equation gives $2x-y=-5a$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }x+2y=a}$.
Response 6:
To have a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we need to check if their ratio is constant. We can see that $\frac{y}{x}$ is equal to 0 for $x=a$, $-\frac{1}{3}$ for $x=3a$, and $-\frac{2}{5}$ for $x=5a$. Since the ratio is not constant, there is no linear relationship between $x$ and $y$. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
We can see that if $x=a$, then $y=0$, giving us the point $(a,0)$. If $x=3a$, then $y=-a$, giving us the point $(3a,-a)$. If $x=5a$, then $y=-2a$, giving us the point $(5a,-2a)$. Since there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we know that the points $(a,0)$, $(3a,-a)$, and $(5a,-2a)$ must be collinear. We can check that the equation of the line passing through these points is $2x-y=5a$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2x-y=-5a}$.
Response 8:
We can see that for each change in $x$ by $2a$, $y$ decreases by $a$. This means that the slope of the line is $-a/(2a)=-1/2$. We can also see that when $x=0$, $y=0$. So the $y$-intercept is $0$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=(-1/2)x+0$ which simplifies to $2x-y=0$. 

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }2x-y=0}$
Response 9:
Substituting the given values of $x$ and $y$ into the equation $ax+b=y$, we have: \begin{align*}
a\cdot a+b&=0\\
a\cdot 3a+b&=-a\\
a\cdot 5a+b&=-2a
\end{align*}Solving this system of equations, we find $a=-\frac{1}{2}$ and $b=\frac{1}{2}a$. Thus, the equation is $x-2y=5a$, which is equivalent to $x+2y=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 5a}$.

Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
Response 0:
We can convert 2 decagrams to grams and then convert grams to milligrams. $$\begin{aligned}2 \text{ decagrams } &= 2 \cdot 10 \text{ grams } \\&= 20 \text{ grams } \\&= 20,000 \text{ milligrams}\end{aligned}$$Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
One 2-decagram container is equal to $2\times10=20$ grams. Since there are $1,000$ milligrams in one gram, there are $20\times1,000=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2,\!000}$ milligrams in one 2-decagram container. 

Therefore, there are 2,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.
Response 2:
Since 1 decagram is 10 grams, 2 decagrams is 20 grams. Since 1,000 milligrams is 1 gram, we have: $$\begin{aligned} 1 \text{ gram} &= 1,000 \text{ milligrams} \\ 20 \text{ grams} &= 20,000 \text{ milligrams} \end{aligned}$$
Thus, there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container. To find how many 1-milligram doses are in the container, we divide 20,000 by 1: $$\frac{20,\!000}{1} = 20,\!000$$
Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
One 2-decagram container is equal to $2 \times 10 = 20$ grams. Since $1,000 \text{ milligrams }= 1 \text{ gram}$, we have $20 \text{ grams } = 20,000 \text{ milligrams}$. Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
$2$ decagrams $=2 \times 10$ grams $=20$ grams $=20,000$ milligrams. Since there are $1,000$ milligrams in $1$ gram, there are $20,000$ milligrams in $20$ grams. Therefore, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }2{,}000}$ $1$-milligram doses in one $2$-decagram container. 

Alternatively, we could convert 2 decagrams to grams and then to milligrams. $2$ decagrams $=20$ grams $=20,000$ milligrams. Thus, there are $20,000$ $1$-milligram doses in one $2$-decagram container.
Response 5:
We have 1 decagram = 10 grams and 1,000 milligrams = 1 gram. Therefore, 1 decagram = 10,000 milligrams. 

Since the medicine is stored in 2-decagram containers, this is equivalent to 20 grams or 20,000 milligrams. 

Each milligram dose is 1/1000 of a gram, so there are 20,000/1 = 20,000 milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
1 decagram = 100 grams

1 decagram = $100 \cdot 1000$ milligrams = 100,000 milligrams

Therefore, 2 decagrams = $2 \cdot 100,000 = 200,000$ milligrams

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are $200,000/1,000 = 200$ grams in 2 decagrams.

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are $200 \cdot 1,000 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2000}$ milligrams in 2 decagrams.

Therefore, there are 2000 one-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.
Response 7:
The 2-decagram container has $2 \cdot 10=20$ grams. Since $1,000$ milligrams is equal to $1$ gram, there are $20 \cdot 1,000 = 20,000$ milligrams in the container. To find the number of 1-milligram doses, we divide by 1: 
$$\frac{20,000 \text{ milligrams}}{1 \text{ milligram per dose}} = 20,000 \text{ doses}$$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
We have $1$ decagram $= 10$ grams $= 10,000$ milligrams. Therefore, $2$ decagrams $= 20,000$ milligrams. One 2-decagram container has $20,000$ milligrams of medicine, which is equal to $20,000$ 1-milligram doses. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
One 2-decagram container is equal to $2 \times 10=20$ grams. Since 1,000 milligrams is equal to 1 gram, then there are $20 \times 1,000 = 20,000$ milligrams in a 20-gram container. Therefore, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 20,\!000}$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Alternatively, since 1 decagram is equal to $10$ grams, then 2 decagrams is equal to $20$ grams. Thus, there are $20\cdot1000=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 20,\!000}$ milligrams in one 2-decagram container.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& g(x)=2 x-1 \\& h(x)=1-g(x)\end{aligned}$$The functions $g$ and $h$ are defined above. What is the value of $h(0)$ ?
Choices:
  A: -2
  B: 0
  C: 1
  D: 2
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C") 

We know that $g(x) = 2x-1$. Therefore, $g(0) = 2(0)-1 = -1$. 

We also know that $h(x) = 1-g(x)$. Substituting $g(0)$ into this expression gives us:

$h(0) = 1 - g(0) = 1 - (-1) = 2$

Therefore, the answer is $h(0) = 2$, which is choice (C).

Question: In the $x y$-plane, the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ passes through the origin. Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 4
  C: 8
  D: 16
Response 0:
We know that the line passes through the origin, so we can substitute $x=0$ and $y=0$ into the equation of the line to get two equations:

$k = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{k-32}{2-k}$

Solving for $k$, we get:

$k^2 - 34k + 64 = 0$

We can factor this to get:

$(k-2)(k-32) = 0$

So $k=2$ or $k=32$. However, we need to check that these values satisfy the condition that the line passes through the origin:

If $k=2$, then the line passes through the points $(2,2)$ and $(2,32)$, which is a vertical line and does not pass through the origin.

If $k=32$, then the line passes through the points $(2,32)$ and $(32,32)$, which is a horizontal line and does not pass through the origin.

Therefore, none of the given choices satisfy the conditions of the problem. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
We can use the fact that the line passes through the origin to set up two equations:
$$k=32\cdot\frac{k-0}{k-2}$$
and
$$2=0\cdot\frac{k-2}{k-32}$$
Simplifying the first equation, we get:
$$k-2=\frac{32}{k-2}\cdot k$$
$$k^2-2k=32$$
$$k^2-2k-32=0$$
$$(k-8)(k+4)=0$$
So, $k=8$ or $k=-4$. However, $k$ cannot be negative since the line passes through the first quadrant and $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ are both positive. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
We know that the line passes through the origin. Therefore, the coordinates of both points $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ must satisfy the equation of the line, which is of the form $y = mx$. 

The slope $m$ of the line is given by: 

\begin{align*}
m &= \frac{32-k}{k-2} \\
\end{align*}

If the line passes through the origin, then both points $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ must satisfy the equation $y=mx$. 

\begin{align*}
2m &= k \\
32m &= k \\
\end{align*}

Setting these two equations equal to each other, we get: 

\begin{align*}
2m &= 32m \\
m &= 0 \\
\end{align*}

Substituting $m=0$ into the equation for the slope, we get: 

\begin{align*}
0 &= \frac{32-k}{k-2} \\
0 &= 32-k \\
k &= 32 \\
\end{align*}

Therefore, the only possible value of $k$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$.

Response 5:

Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We know that the line passes through the origin, so the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point $(k, 32)$ must be proportional to the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point $(2, k)$. This gives us the equation $k/2 = 32/k$, which simplifies to $k^2 = 64$, or $k = \pm 8$. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
We know that the line passes through the origin. So, substituting $(0,0)$ for $(x,y)$ in the equation of line, we get $y=\frac{32}{k-2}x$. 
Also, we know that the line passes through $(2,k)$. Substituting this point in the equation of line, we get $k=\frac{32}{k-2} \times 2$. 
Simplifying this, we get $k^2-36k+64=0$. 
Solving this quadratic equation, we get $k=16$ or $k=4$.

The median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for all 50 states was $26.95 \%$. What is the difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states?
Choices:
  A: $0.05 \%$
  B: $0.95 \%$
  C: $1.22 \%$
  D: $7.45 \%$
Response 0:
First, we need to find the median of the given 7 states. Arranging the data in order, we get:

$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$

The median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between this median and the median for all 50 states is:

$|27.9 \% - 26.95 \%| = 0.95 \%$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 1:
First, we need to find the median of the given 7 states. We can do this by ordering the percents from least to greatest: $$19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%$$ We can see that the median is $27.9\%$. The difference between this median and the median for all 50 states ($26.95\%$) is: $$27.9\% - 26.95\% = 0.95\%$$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 2:
To find the median of these 7 states, we need to put the $7$ percentages in order from least to greatest. We get: $$19.5 \% , 21.9 \% , 25.9 \% , 27.9 \% , 30.1 \% , 35.5 \% , 36.4 \%$$ The median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $26.95 \% - 27.9 \% = -0.95 \%$. However, we want the difference as a positive value, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 3:
To find the median of the 7 states, we first order the percentages from least to greatest: $$19.5 \% \quad 21.9 \% \quad 25.9 \% \quad 27.9 \% \quad 30.1 \% \quad 35.5 \% \quad 36.4 \%$$ We see that the median is the fourth value, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median of these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 4:

The median is the fourth value, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$.

To find the median of the 7 states, we need to order the data: $$ 19.5 \% \leq 21.9 \% \leq 25.9 \% \leq 27.9 \% \leq 30.1 \% \leq 35.5 \% \leq 36.4 \% $$ The median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median of these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is: $$ \begin{aligned} \lvert 27.9 - 26.95 \rvert &= 0.95 \% \\ \end{aligned} $$ Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 6:
To find the median of a set of data, we need to order the data from least to greatest. The ordered data for the 7 states are as follows: $$19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%.$$The median for these 7 states is the middle number, which is $27.9\%$. The difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $$|27.9\%-26.95\%|=0.95\%.$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 7:
First, we need to find the median of the given 7 states. We order the percents in increasing order: $$19.5 \% < 21.9 \% < 25.9 \% < 27.9 \% < 30.1 \% < 35.5 \% < 36.4 \%.$$The median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between this median and the overall median of $26.95 \%$ is $$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%,$$so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 8:
First, we need to find the median of the given 7 states. Writing the given percents in order, we get:

$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$

The median is $27.9 \%$, which is the same as the value for State B. The difference between the median for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is:

$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 9:
The median is the middle value of a set of data. In this case, we have $7$ data points. When we order them, we get:

$19.5 \%,$ $21.9 \%,$ $25.9 \%,$ $27.9 \%,$ $30.1 \%,$ $35.5 \%,$ $36.4 \%$

The median is $27.9 \%$. The difference between this and the median for all $50$ states, $26.95 \%$, is:

$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}Year & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Subscriptions } \\ \text { sold }\end{array}$ \\\hline2012 & 5,600 \\2013 & 5,880 \\\end{tabular}\end{center}The manager of an online news service received the report above on the number of subscriptions sold by the service. The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
First, we need to calculate the percent increase from 2012 to 2013, which is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05$ or 5%. Let's call this percent increase $x$. 

Next, we know that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is half of the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. This means the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $\frac{x}{2}$.

To find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, we need to add the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 to the 2013 subscription count of 5,880. Let's call the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 $y$. 

Using the percent increase formula, we can set up the equation: 

$y - 5880 = \frac{x}{2}(5880)$

Simplifying this equation: 

$y = 5880 + \frac{x}{2}(5880)$

Now we need to find the value of $x$ to solve for $y$. We know that $x$ is the percent increase from 2012 to 2013, so we can set up another percent increase formula to solve for $x$: 

$\frac{y - 5880}{5880} = 2x$

Simplifying this equation: 

$x = \frac{y - 5880}{2(5880)}$

We can substitute this expression for $x$ into the equation for $y$: 

$y = 5880 + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{y - 5880}{2(5880)}\right)(5880)$

Simplifying this equation: 

$y = 5880 + \frac{y - 5880}{8}$

Multiplying both sides by 8: 

$8y = 8(5880) + y - 5880$

Simplifying: 

$7y = 5880 \cdot 7 + 5880$

$y = 6,468$

Therefore, the manager expected 6,468 subscriptions to be sold in 2014. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
The problem mentions 2013 and 2014, but only gives us data for 2012 and 2013. We need to use this data to make an estimate for 2014. Let's call the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 "x". 

The problem states that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is half the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Let's use "p" to represent the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{1}{2}p$. 

From 2012 to 2013, the number of subscriptions increased from 5,600 to 5,880. That's an increase of 280, or approximately 5%. We can use this to set up an equation:

$5,880 = 5,600(1 + 0.05)$

Simplifying this equation gives us:

$5,880 = 5,880$

This is true, but not particularly helpful. We need to use the information about the percent increases to set up another equation. 

If the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is "p", then the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 will be:

$x = 5,880(1 + p)$

But we also know that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is half the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. We can use this to set up another equation:

$0.05 = \frac{1}{2}p$

Solving for "p" gives us:

$p = 0.1$

Now we can substitute this value of "p" into our equation for 2014 subscriptions:

$x = 5,880(1 + 0.1)$

Simplifying this equation gives us:

$x = 6,468$

So the manager expected 6,468 subscriptions to be sold in 2014.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Unfortunately, the question seems incomplete as the data for 2014 is missing. Please provide the data for 2014 or clarify the question.
Response 3:
We cannot determine the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 since we are not given the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. However, we can set up an equation using the information given. Let x be the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. Then the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $\frac{x}{2}$. Using these percents, we can write:

$5,880 = 5,600(1+x)$
$S = 5,880(1+\frac{x}{2})$

where $S$ is the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Simplifying the second equation:

$S = 5,880 + \frac{1}{2}(5,880)x$

We can solve for x by substituting the first equation into the second equation:

$S = 5,880 + \frac{1}{2}(5,880)(\frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600})$
$S = 6,027$

So the manager expected 6,027 subscriptions to be sold in 2014.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can begin by finding the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: 

$$\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\times 100\%\approx 5\%$$ 

Let $x$ represent the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is $2x$. We want $2x$ to be double 5%, so $2x=10\%$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=5\%$. 

Using this percent increase, we can find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014: 

$$5880\times 1.05\approx \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6440}$$
Response 5:
We cannot determine the answer to this question without additional information about the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
Response 6:
First, we need to calculate the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: 

$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05$ or 5% increase 

Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is 2x. 

Using the formula for percent increase, we can set up the following equation: 

$1.05 \cdot (1+x) = 1 + 2x$

Simplifying and solving for x, we get: 

$x = 0.1$

Therefore, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is 10%. 

To find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, we can multiply the number sold in 2013 by 1.1: 

$5880 \cdot 1.1 = 6,468$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D") 

To solve the problem, we can use the formula for percent increase: 

percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then we have:

- From 2012 to 2013, the percent increase is:

percent increase = $\frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$

- From 2013 to 2014, the percent increase is:

percent increase = $\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$

The problem tells us that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Therefore:

$2 \times \frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} = \frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600}$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$x \approx 6,468$

Therefore, the manager expected 6,468 subscriptions to be sold in 2014. The closest choice is D.
Response 8:
First, we need to find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. To do this, we can use the formula:

percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Plugging in the values, we get:

percent increase from 2012 to 2013 = $\frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$

Next, we need to find the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Let's call this percent increase "x". Then we know that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is double this, or 2x. We can set up an equation:

2x = 5\% + x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 5\%

So the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is 5\%. To find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, we can use the formula:

new value = old value $\times$ (1 + percent increase)

Plugging in the values, we get:

new value = 5,880 $\times$ (1 + 5\%) $\approx$ 6,168

Therefore, the manager expected 6,168 subscriptions to be sold in 2014.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("D") 

To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase:

percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is:

$\frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$

Let y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is:

$2y = (1+y)^2-1 \approx 2y+2y^2$

Simplifying and solving for y, we get:

$2y^2+2y-1 \approx 0$

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

$y \approx 0.468$

Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is:

$x \approx 5,880 \times (1+y) \approx 6,468$

So, the answer is D.

Question: A customer paid $\$ 53.00$ for a jacket after a 6 percent sales tax was added. What was the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 47.60$
  B: $\$ 50.00$
  C: $\$ 52.60$
  D: $\$ 52.84$
Response 0:
Let $x$ be the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added. 

Since the 6% sales tax is added to the original price, the total amount paid is:

$$x + 0.06x = 1.06x$$

We know that the customer paid $\$ 53.00$ for the jacket, so we can set up the following equation:

$$1.06x = 53$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = \frac{53}{1.06} \approx 50$$

Therefore, the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added was $\$ 50.00$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let $x$ be the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added. 

The price of the jacket after the sales tax was added is $x + 0.06x = 1.06x$.

We know that the customer paid $\$53.00$ for the jacket after the sales tax was added. 

So we have the equation: 

$$1.06x = 53.00$$ 

Solving for $x$, we get: 

$$x = \frac{53.00}{1.06} \approx 50.00$$

Therefore, the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added was $\$50.00$, which is choice B.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company purchased a machine valued at $\$ 120,000$. The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year so that after 10 years the value will be $\$ 30,000$. Which of the following equations gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased for $0 \leq t \leq 10 ?$
Choices:
  A: $v=30,000-9,000 t$
  B: $v=120,000-9,000 t$
  C: $v=120,000+9,000 t$
  D: $v=120,000-30,000 t$
Response 0:
Since the value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year, we can find the annual depreciation by dividing the total depreciation by the number of years: 

$120,000 - 30,000 = 90,000$
 
$90,000 \div 10 = 9,000$

Therefore, the value of the machine, $v$, $t$ years after it was purchased is given by:

$v = 120,000 - 9,000t$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
At the time of purchase, the value of the machine is $\$ 120,000$. Since the value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year, we can find the yearly depreciation rate by dividing the total depreciation by the number of years: $\frac{120000-30000}{10}=9000$. Therefore, for each year $t$ after the purchase, the value of the machine can be represented as $v=120,000-9,000t$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
We can use the formula for linear depreciation, which is $v = P - rt$, where $P$ is the initial value of the machine, $r$ is the depreciation rate, $t$ is the time in years, and $v$ is the current value of the machine. 

We are given that the initial value of the machine is $\$120,000$, and that the value depreciates by the same amount each year. After 10 years, the value will be $\$30,000$. So, we can set up the equation:

$30,000 = 120,000 - 10r$

Simplifying, we get:

$10r = 90,000$

$r = 9,000$

Therefore, the equation that gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased is:

$v = 120,000 - 9,000t$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
We can find the amount of depreciation per year by subtracting the final value from the initial value and dividing by the number of years: $\frac{120,000-30,000}{10}=9,000.$ Therefore, for each year that passes, the value of the machine decreases by $9,000.$ Since the initial value of the machine is $\$ 120,000,$ the equation that gives the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased is: $v=120,000-9,000t.$

We can use the information given to set up a linear equation in slope-intercept form: $v = mt + b$, where $m$ is the slope (the amount the value depreciates each year) and $b$ is the initial value of the machine.

We know that the initial value of the machine is $\$ 120,000$, so $b=120000$. We also know that after 10 years, the value will be $\$ 30,000$, so we can use this information to solve for the slope:

$30000 = m(10) + 120000$

$-90000 = 10m$

$m = -9000$

So the equation for the value of the machine, $v$, as a function of time, $t$, is:

$v = -9000t + 120000$

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
To calculate the annual depreciation, we can subtract the final value from the initial value and divide by the number of years: $\frac{120,000-30,000}{10}=9,000$. Therefore, the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased can be represented by $v=120,000-9,000t$.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& x=y-3 \\& \frac{x}{2}+2 y=6\end{aligned}$$Which ordered pair $(x, y)$ satisfies the system of equations shown above?
Choices:
  A: $(-3,0)$
  B: $(0,3)$
  C: $(6,-3)$
  D: $(36,-6)$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
We can solve the system of equations by substituting the first equation into the second equation. This gives us:

$$\frac{(y-3)}{2}+2y=6$$
Simplifying the equation above, we get:
$$\frac{y}{2} - \frac{3}{2} + 2y = 6$$
$$\frac{5y}{2} = \frac{15}{2} + \frac{3}{2}$$
$$y = 3$$

Substituting y = 3 into the first equation gives us:
$$x = y - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0$$

Therefore, the ordered pair $(x, y) = (0, 3)$ satisfies the system of equations.

Response 7:
Substitute the value of $x$ from the first equation into the second equation and solve for $y$.
$$\frac{y-3}{2}+2y=6$$
$$\frac{y-3}{2}=\frac{6}{3}$$
$$\frac{y-3}{2}=2$$
$$y-3=4$$
$$y=7$$
Substitute the value of $y$ into the first equation and solve for $x$.
$$x=7-3$$
$$x=4$$
Therefore, the ordered pair is $(x,y)=(4,7)$.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
We can solve this system of equations using substitution method. We substitute $x$ in terms of $y$ from the first equation into the second equation and solve for $y$. We get $y=3$. We can substitute this value of $y$ back into the first equation to find $x$. We get $x=0$. Therefore, the ordered pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the system of equations is $(0,3)$.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week?
Choices:
  A: 38
  B: 33
  C: 22
  D: 16
Response 0:
Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, the number of hours he worked for the entire week is $10 + h$. 

The amount of money he earns for the first 10 hours is $8 \cdot 10 = 80$ dollars, and the amount of money he earns for the rest of the week is $10h$ dollars. Therefore, he earns $80 + 10h$ dollars for the entire week.

He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week, so he saves $0.9(80 + 10h) = 72 + 9h$ dollars for the entire week.

We want to find the least value of $h$ such that $72 + 9h \ge 270$. Solving for $h$, we have $h \ge 22$. 

Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 22}$.
Response 1:
Let $x$ denote the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then he worked $10$ hours for $\$ 8$ per hour, so he earned $\$ 80$ from those $10$ hours. For the remaining $x$ hours, he earns $\$ 10$ per hour. Therefore, he earns $10(x) = 10x$ dollars from those $x$ hours. The total amount he earns for the week is $80+10x$ dollars. He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10x) = 72 + 9x$ dollars for the week. To save at least $\$ 270$ for the week, we must have \begin{align*}
72+9x &\geq 270 \\
9x &\geq 198 \\
x &\geq 22.
\end{align*}Thus, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 2:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken worked after the first 10 hours. Then, the amount of money he earned is $8\cdot 10 + 10x = 80 + 10x$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings which is $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$. We want to find the least $x$ such that $72+9x \geq 270$, or $9x \geq 198$, or $x \geq 22$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 3:
Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works after the first 10 hours. Ken earns $\$ 8 \cdot 10 + \$ 10h$ per week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of this, which is $0.9(\$ 80 + \$ 10h) = \$ 72 + \$ 9h$. We want this to be at least $\$ 270$, so we write the inequality $72 + 9h \geq 270$. Solving for $h$, we have $9h \geq 198$, so $h \geq 22$. Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$.
Response 4:
Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works after the first 10 hours. Then, he earns $8 \cdot 10 + 10h = 80 + 10h$ dollars. Ken saves $90 \%$ of this, which is $0.9(80+10h) = 72 + 9h$. We want $72+9h \ge 270$, so $9h \ge 198$ and $h \ge 22$. The smallest integer greater than or equal to 22 is 22, so Ken must work at least $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$ hours.
Response 5:
Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours for $\$ 8$ per hour, so he earned $\$ 80$ for the first $10$ hours. For the rest of the week, he earns $\$ 10$ per hour, so he will earn $10h$ dollars. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are $\$ 80 + \$ 10h$. 

He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he will save $0.9(\$ 80 + \$ 10h) = \$ 72 + \$ 9h$ dollars for the week. We want to find the least $h$ such that $\$ 72 + \$ 9h \geq \$ 270$. Solving for $h$, we get $h \geq \frac{198}{9} \approx 22$. 

Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 6:
Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours in the first part of the week. So, he earned $8 \cdot 10 + 10h = 80 + 10h$ dollars. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10h) = 72+9h$ dollars. We want to find the least $h$ such that $72+9h \ge 270$. Solving this inequality gives $h \ge 22$. Thus, the least number of hours Ken must work is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 7:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works at $\$ 10$ per hour. He earns $\$ 8 \cdot 10 = \$ 80$ for the first 10 hours and $\$ 10x$ for the remaining hours. His total earnings are $\$ 80 + \$ 10x$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so the amount he saves for the week is $0.9(\$ 80 + \$ 10x)$. We want this to be at least $\$ 270$. Therefore, we have the equation \begin{align*}
0.9(\$ 80 + \$ 10x) &\geq \$ 270\\
\$ 72 + \$ 9x &\geq \$ 270\\
\$ 9x &\geq \$ 198\\
x &\geq 22.
\end{align*} Ken must work at least $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$ hours to save at least $\$ 270$.
Response 8:
Let's begin by calculating Ken's earnings for the first 10 hours of work: 
$8\text{ dollars/hour} \cdot 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ dollars}$

Let's call the number of hours Ken needs to work after the first 10 hours $x$. 
His total earnings for the week would be:
$80 \text{ dollars} + 10\text{ dollars/hour} \cdot x \text{ hours} = 80+10x \text{ dollars}$

He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves:
$0.90(80+10x) = 72+9x$

We want to find the least number of hours $x$ for which $72+9x \geq 270$. 
Solving for $x$, we get $x\geq 22$. 

Therefore, Ken must work at least $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$ more hours to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week.
Response 9:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works beyond the first 10 hours. Then, he earns $8 \cdot 10 + 10x$ dollars in total for the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of this amount, which is $0.9(80+10x) = 72+9x$ dollars. We want this amount to be at least $\$ 270,$ so we have the inequality $72+9x \geq 270.$ Solving for $x,$ we find $x \geq 22.$ Therefore, Ken must work at least $22$ hours beyond the first $10$ hours.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages. For each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. What is the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 6
Response 0:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries 'x' 100-pound packages and 'y' 120-pound packages.
From the given information, we have two constraints:
1. x + y >= 10 (the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
2. 100x + 120y <= 1100 (the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)
We need to maximize the value of 'y'. Let's solve for 'y' in both equations:
1. y >= 10 - x
2. y <= (1100 - 100x) / 120
Combining these two inequalities, we get:
10 - x <= y <= (1100 - 100x) / 120
To maximize the value of 'y', we need to make it as close as possible to the upper limit, which is (1100 - 100x) / 120. However, 'y' must be an integer, so we need to round down to the nearest integer. Therefore, we have:
y <= floor((1100 - 100x) / 120)
Simplifying this inequality, we get:
y <= (55 - 5x) / 6
To maximize 'y', we need to maximize the right-hand side of this inequality. The largest integer value of 'y' that satisfies this inequality is 5, which occurs when x = 2. Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let x be the number of 100-pound packages and y be the number of 120-pound packages. We have the following system of inequalities:
```
x + y ≥ 10   (the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
100x + 120y ≤ 1100   (the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)
```
We want to maximize y, the number of 120-pound packages. Solving for x in the first inequality, we get:
```
x ≥ 10 - y
```
Substituting this into the second inequality, we get:
```
100(10 - y) + 120y ≤ 1100
1000 - 100y + 120y ≤ 1100
20y ≤ 100
y ≤ 5
```
Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries "x" 100-pound packages and "y" 120-pound packages.
From the given information, we know that:
x + y ≥ 10  (helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
100x + 120y ≤ 1100  (total weight of packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)

We need to find the maximum value of "y" that satisfies the above conditions.

Let's solve the first inequality for "x":
x + y ≥ 10
x ≥ 10 - y

Substituting this in the second inequality:
100x + 120y ≤ 1100
100(10 - y) + 120y ≤ 1100
1000 - 100y + 120y ≤ 1100
20y ≤ 100
y ≤ 5

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries "x" number of 120-pound packages and "y" number of 100-pound packages. We know that x + y must be at least 10, and 120x + 100y must be at most 1,100. We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 20, so we get 6x + 5y <= 55. Now we can use trial and error to find the maximum value of x that satisfies both equations:
- If x = 6, then 6 + y >= 10, so y >= 4. But 6(120) + 4(100) = 1,040, which is less than 1,100. So x = 6 is a valid solution.
- If x = 7, then 7 + y >= 10, so y >= 3. But 7(120) + 3(100) = 1,190, which is more than 1,100. So x = 7 is not a valid solution.
Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 6. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let x be the number of 100-pound packages and y be the number of 120-pound packages. We are looking for the maximum value of y that satisfies the conditions:
x + y ≥ 10
100x + 120y ≤ 1100
Simplifying the second inequality by dividing both sides by 20, we get:
5x + 6y ≤ 55
Rearranging the first inequality, we get:
y ≥ 10 - x
Substituting y with (10 - x) in the second inequality, we get:
5x + 6(10 - x) ≤ 55
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
x ≤ 5
Therefore, the maximum value of x is 5, which means the maximum value of y is 10 - x = 10 - 5 = 5.
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries x 100-pound packages and y 120-pound packages. From the problem, we know that:
- x + y ≥ 10 (the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
- 100x + 120y ≤ 1100 (the total weight cannot exceed 1100 pounds)

We want to find the maximum value of y, so we need to solve for y. Let's rearrange the first equation to get x in terms of y:
- x + y ≥ 10
- x ≥ 10 - y

Substituting this into the second equation:
- 100x + 120y ≤ 1100
- 100(10-y) + 120y ≤ 1100
- 1000 - 100y + 120y ≤ 1100
- 20y ≤ 100
- y ≤ 5

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's denote the number of 100-pound packages as "x" and the number of 120-pound packages as "y". We can create the following system of inequalities:
```
x + y >= 10  (the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
100x + 120y <= 1100  (the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)
```
We want to maximize the value of "y". To do this, we can solve for "x" in the first inequality and substitute it into the second inequality:
```
x + y >= 10
x >= 10 - y
100x + 120y <= 1100
100(10-y) + 120y <= 1100
1000 - 100y + 120y <= 1100
20y <= 100
y <= 5
```
Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To find the linear function that models the production, we need to find the slope (rate of decrease) and the initial value (production in 2000). 

The production decreased from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels over 13 years, or $\frac{2.1}{13}\approx 0.162$ million barrels per year. This is the slope of the linear function.

The initial value is 4 million barrels in 2000. Therefore, the linear function is of the form $f(t) = mt+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the initial value. 

Substituting the slope and initial value, we get:

$f(t) = 0.162t + 4$

To put this function in the given form, we can simplify the coefficient of $t$ by multiplying both sides by 130:

$f(t) = \frac{21}{130}t + 4$

Therefore, the answer is (A) $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$.
Response 2:
We can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, where the slope is equal to the rate of decrease in millions of barrels per year. The initial production in 2000 is (0, 4) and the production in 2013 is (13, 1.9). Therefore, the slope is:

$$
m = \frac{1.9-4}{13-0} = -\frac{21}{130}
$$

The y-intercept is 4, so the equation of the line is:

$$
f(t) = -\frac{21}{130}t + 4
$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
To find the slope of the line, we need to take the difference between the two production values and divide by the difference in the years: 
slope = $\frac{1.9-4}{2013-2000}=-\frac{21}{130}$. 

Since the question is asking for the production in millions of barrels, we need to scale the slope by a factor of 1 million. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
To find the linear function that best models the production, we need to use the two given data points: $(0,4)$ and $(13,1.9)$. We can use the slope formula to find the slope $m$ of the line passing through these two points: 

$$m = \frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x} = \frac{1.9-4}{13-0} = -\frac{21}{130}$$

Then, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the function $f$:

$$f(t) - 4 = -\frac{21}{130}t$$

Simplifying and rearranging, we get:

$$f(t) = -\frac{21}{130}t + 4$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.
Response 5:
The production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. The number of years between 2000 and 2013 is 13. Therefore, the production decreased by 4-1.9=2.1 million barrels in 13 years. 

The rate of decrease can be found by dividing the decrease in production by the number of years: $\frac{2.1}{13} \approx 0.1615$. 

The initial production in 2000 was 4 million barrels, therefore, the function that models the production is $f(t) = -0.1615t + 4$ where $t$ is the number of years after 2000.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
To find the linear function that models the production, we need to use the two given data points (2000, 4) and (2013, 1.9) to find the slope and y-intercept of the function. The slope is the rate of change of the production, which is the change in the y-value divided by the change in the x-value. 

Slope = (1.9-4)/(2013-2000) = -0.1

The y-intercept is the y-value when t=0, which is 4. 

Therefore, the equation of the linear function is:

f(t) = -0.1t + 4

To check which of the given functions matches this equation, we can simplify each function by multiplying and dividing by 10:

A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$ = 0.162t + 4. Not equivalent.
B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$ = 0.146t + 4. Not equivalent.
C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$ = -0.162t + 4. Not equivalent.
D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$ = -0.146t + 4. Equivalent.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation, which is given by $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope of the line. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels over a period of 13 years. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13}\approx 0.1615$ million barrels per year. 

Let $t$ be the number of years after 2000. Then, in the year $2000+t$, the production is $4-0.1615t$ million barrels. Thus, the function that models the production is $f(t)=4-0.1615t$. 

To check which of the given functions is equivalent to $f(t)$, we can simplify each function and compare it to $f(t)$. 

A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130}t+4 = 0.1615t+4.0308$
B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130}t+4 = 0.1462t+4.0308$
C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4 = -0.1615t+4.8462$
D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130}t+4 = -0.1462t+4.8462$

We can see that the function that best models the production is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }f(t)=\frac{19}{130}t+4}$.
Response 8:
We can start by finding the slope of the line that connects the points $(0,4)$ and $(13,1.9)$, which represents the decrease in production over the $13$-year period. The slope is given by:

$$m = \frac{1.9 - 4}{13 - 0} = -\frac{21}{130}$$

This tells us that the production decreased by $21/130$ million barrels per year. We can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to find the linear function $f$. Using the point $(0,4)$, we get:

$$f(t) - 4 = -\frac{21}{130} t$$

Solving for $f(t)$, we get:

$$f(t) = -\frac{21}{130} t + 4$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.
Response 9:
To find the linear function that models the production, we need to use the two data points: $(0, 4)$ and $(13, 1.9)$. The slope of the line passing through these points gives us the rate of decrease in millions of barrels per year. 

The change in production over 13 years is $1.9-4=-2.1$ million barrels. The corresponding change in $t$ is $13-0=13$ years. Therefore, the slope of the line is $\frac{-2.1}{13}=-\frac{21}{130}$.

The $y$-intercept of the line is the initial production, which is 4 million barrels.

Putting this together, we get the equation of the line in slope-intercept form: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$.

Question: The formula below is often used by project managers to compute $E$, the estimated time to complete a job, where $O$ is the shortest completion time, $P$ is the longest completion time, and $M$ is the most likely completion time.$$E=\frac{O+4 M+P}{6}$$Which of the following correctly gives $P$ in terms of $E, O$, and $M$ ?
Choices:
  A: $P=6 E-O-4 M$
  B: $P=-6 E+O+4 M$
  C: $P=\frac{O+4 M+E}{6}$
  D: $P=\frac{O+4 M-E}{6}$
Response 0:
We can solve for $P$ by isolating the variable $P$ in the formula. 

First, we can start by multiplying both sides of the formula by 6 to get: 

$$6E = O + 4M + P$$

Next, we can subtract $O+4M$ from both sides of the equation to get: 

$$P = 6E - O - 4M$$

So the answer is (A) $P=6E-O-4M$.
Response 4:
We can solve the given formula for $P$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
E&=\frac{O+4M+P}{6} \\

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer(A)
Response 7:
We can solve the given formula for $P$ by multiplying both sides by $6$ and then rearranging the terms:$$\begin{aligned} E &=\frac{O+4 M+P}{6} \\ 6 E &= O+4 M+P \\ P &= 6 E-O-4 M \end{aligned}$$Therefore, the answer is (A) $P=6 E-O-4 M$.

Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline1 & 5 \\\hline3 & 13 \\\hline5 & 21 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of the linear function $f$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=2 x+3$
  B: $f(x)=3 x+2$
  C: $f(x)=4 x+1$
  D: $f(x)=5 x$
Response 0:
Let's find the slope of the line, which is given by $\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\text{change in }f(x)}{\text{change in }x}$. We have:
$$\frac{\text{change in }f(x)}{\text{change in }x}=\frac{21-5}{5-1}=4$$
Therefore, the slope of the line is $4$. The $y$-intercept is $f(1)=5$. Hence, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To find a linear function, we need to find the slope and the $y$-intercept. In this case, we can see that when $x=1$, $f(x)=5$. When $x=5$, $f(x)=21$. So the slope is $\frac{21-5}{5-1}=4$. Therefore, we can eliminate choices (A), (B) and (D) since they all have different slopes. The only choice that is left is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4x+1}$.
Response 2:
We can observe that every time $x$ increases by 2, $f(x)$ increases by 8. Therefore, the slope of the line is $\frac{8}{2}=4$. We also notice that $f(1)=5$, which means the $y-$intercept is 1. Thus, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
We can find the slope of the line by using any two points from the table. Let's use $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$: 

slope $=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. 

So the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is: 

$$y=mx+b$$
$$y=4x+b$$

To find $b$, we can use any point on the line. Let's use $(1,5)$: 

$$5=4(1)+b$$
$$b=1$$

Thus, the equation of the line is $y=4x+1$, which corresponds to $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}}$.
Response 4:
We can determine the slope of the linear function $f$ using any two points. Let's use the first and second rows of the table to find that $f$ has a slope of $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. We can then use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find that $f(x)-5=4(x-1)$, which simplifies to $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To solve this, we need to find the slope and the y-intercept of the linear function. 

The slope is given by the change in $f(x)$ over the change in $x$, which is equal to:
$\frac{f(5)-f(1)}{5-1}=\frac{21-5}{4}=4$

To find the y-intercept, we can use the point-slope formula or we can just observe that when $x=0$, $f(x)=-3$. Therefore, the y-intercept is $-3$.

So the equation of the linear function is $f(x)=4x-3$. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
We can see that the function $f$ has a slope of $4$ because $f(5)-f(1)=21-5=16$ and $5-1=4$. Also, the $y$-intercept of $f$ is $1$ because $f(1)=5$. Therefore, the equation of $f$ is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To determine the equation of the linear function $f$, we need to find the slope and the $y$-intercept. The slope is given by the change in $f(x)$ divided by the corresponding change in $x$. For example, between $x=1$ and $x=3$, $f(x)$ increases by $13-5=8$, while $x$ increases by $3-1=2$. Therefore, the slope is $m=\frac{8}{2}=4$. 

To find the $y$-intercept, we can use any of the given points. For example, using $x=1$ and $f(x)=5$, we can write $f(x)=mx+b$ as $5=4(1)+b$, which gives $b=1$. 

Therefore, the equation of the linear function $f$ is $f(x)=4x+1$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4x+1}$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
To solve this problem, we can use the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. We can find the slope by dividing the change in $f(x)$ by the change in $x$, using any two points from the table. For example, using $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$, we get $$m=\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=\frac{8}{2}=4.$$ Then we can use one of the points and the slope to find the $y$-intercept. Using $(1,5)$ and $m=4$, we get $$5=4(1)+b,$$ which gives us $b=1$. Therefore, the equation of $f$ is $f(x)=4x+1$.

Question: Dreams Recalled during One Week\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\hline& None & 1 to 4 & 5 or more & Total \\\hline\hlineGroup X & 15 & 28 & 57 & 100 \\\hlineGroup Y & 21 & 11 & 68 & 100 \\\hlineTotal & 36 & 39 & 125 & 200 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The data in the table above were produced by a sleep researcher studying the number of dreams people recall when asked to record their dreams for one week. Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$
Response 0:
Out of the 39 people who recalled 1 or more dreams, 68 - 39 = 29 belong to Group Y. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is: $$\frac{29}{39} = \frac{79}{107} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{79}{164}}$$ Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
The probability of choosing a person who recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{200-36}{200}=\frac{164}{200}$. The probability that the chosen person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{68}{100} \div \frac{125}{200} = \frac{68}{125}$. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
The probability that a person belongs to Group Y given that they recalled at least one dream is equal to the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least one dream. From the table, we can see that there are $11+68=79$ people who recalled at least one dream in Group Y, and $39+125=164$ people who recalled at least one dream in total. Thus, the probability that a person belongs to Group Y given that they recalled at least one dream is:

$$\frac{79}{164}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$.
Response 3:
The probability that a person recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{200-36}{200} = \frac{8}{11}$. The probability that a person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{68}{125}$. Therefore, the probability that a person belonged to Group Y if they recalled at least 1 dream is: $$\frac{\frac{68}{125} \cdot \frac{8}{11}}{\frac{8}{11}} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } \frac{68}{100}}.$$
Response 4:
The table shows that out of the total 39 people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams, 11 of them were from Group Y. Similarly, out of the total 125 people who recalled 5 or more dreams, 68 of them were from Group Y. Therefore, out of the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream, the number of people from Group Y is $11+68=79$. Since there are a total of $36+39+125=200$ people who recorded their dreams, and $36$ of them did not recall any dreams, the probability of choosing a person who recalled at least 1 dream and belonged to Group Y is $\frac{79}{200-36}=\frac{79}{164}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
The probability that a person belongs to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is equal to the number of people who belong to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $39+125=164$. The number of people who belong to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream is $68$. Therefore, the probability that a person belongs to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is: 

$$\frac{68}{164}=\frac{17}{41}$$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{79}{164}}$
Response 6:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is the ratio of the number of people who recalled at least 1 dream in Group Y to the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. That is, $$\frac{68}{68+57+11}=\frac{68}{136}=\frac{1}{2}$$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$.
Response 7:
The probability of a person being chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{164}{200}=\frac{41}{50}$. 
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{\text{Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}}=\frac{68}{107}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
The probability of selecting a person who recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{200-36}{200}=\frac{164}{200}$. Out of these 164 people, 68 belonged to Group Y. Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{68}{164}$.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$C=75 h+125$$The equation above gives the amount $C$, in dollars, an electrician charges for a job that takes $h$ hours. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland each hired this electrician. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. How much more did the electrician charge Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 75$
  B: $\$ 125$
  C: $\$ 150$
  D: $\$ 275$
Response 0:
Let's start by finding out how much the electrician charged Mr. Roland. Let's say he worked for $x$ hours on Mr. Roland's job. Then, he worked for $x+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. We know that the amount charged is given by $C=75h+125$. So, the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is $C_1=75x+125$ and the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C_2=75(x+2)+125=75x+225$. 

To find out how much more the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland, we need to calculate the difference $C_2-C_1$. 

$C_2-C_1=(75x+225)-(75x+125)=100$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$ 100$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Let the number of hours the electrician worked on Mr. Roland's job be $x$. Then, the number of hours the electrician worked on Ms. Sanchez's job is $x+2$. 

Using the equation given, the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job is $C=75x+125$ dollars. 

For Ms. Sanchez's job, the amount charged is $C=75(x+2)+125=75x+225$ dollars.

The difference in the amount charged is: 

$$(75x+225)-(75x+125)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$150}.$$
Response 2:
Let's first find out how much the electrician charged Mr. Roland.
If the electrician worked for $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job, then he worked for $h+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job.
Using the given equation, the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job is:
$$C_{Mr.Roland}=75h+125$$
The amount charged by the electrician for Ms. Sanchez's job is:
$$C_{Ms.Sanchez}=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$$
Therefore, the amount more charged to Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland is:
$$C_{Ms.Sanchez}-C_{Mr.Roland}=(75h+225)-(75h+125)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$150}$$
Response 3:
Let's first find the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. Since he worked $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job, the amount charged would be $C=75h+125$. 

Now, for Ms. Sanchez's job, he worked 2 hours longer, so the amount charged would be $C=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$. 

The difference in the amount charged is: $$75h+225-(75h+125)=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$150}$$
Response 4:
Let's first find out how much the electrician charged Mr. Roland. Let $x$ be the amount of time in hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland. Then, the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job is $C=75x+125$ dollars. 

For Ms. Sanchez's job, the electrician worked for 2 hours longer, which means he worked for $x+2$ hours. The amount charged by the electrician for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C=75(x+2)+125$ dollars.

We need to find the difference between the two amounts, which is:

$$(75(x+2)+125)-(75x+125) = 75x+150-75x = 150$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's start by first finding out how much the electrician charged Mr. Roland. Let's substitute $h$ with $x$.
So, for Mr. Roland's job, $$C = 75x + 125$$
For Ms. Sanchez's job, the electrician worked 2 hours longer than Mr. Roland, so the number of hours he worked on her job was $x+2$. Therefore, the amount Ms. Sanchez was charged is, $$C = 75(x+2) + 125 = 75x + 225 + 125 = 75x + 350$$
We want to find the difference between the amount Ms. Sanchez was charged and the amount Mr. Roland was charged, so let's subtract the two equations:
$$(75x + 350) - (75x + 125) = 225$$
Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$225$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's first find out how much the electrician charged Mr. Roland. We can use the given equation with $h$ being the number of hours Mr. Roland's job took. So the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is $C=75h+125$.

Now we know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job. So let's say Ms. Sanchez's job took $h+2$ hours. Then the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$.

The question asks how much more the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland. So we need to find the difference between the two amounts:

$$(75h+225)-(75h+125)=100$$

So the answer is $\$100$, which is not one of the choices. However, we can see that the answer is exactly halfway between $\$75$ and $\$125$, which are the amounts charged for one hour of work. This suggests that we made a mistake somewhere and the answer should be one of the choices. Looking back at our work, we can see that we made a mistake in the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job. It should be:

$$C=75h+125$$

since his job took $h$ hours. Then the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is:

$$C=75(h+2)+125=75h+275$$

The difference between the two amounts is:

$$(75h+275)-(75h+125)=150$$

So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$150}$.
Response 7:
Let's first find the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's work. If he charges $C$ dollars for $h$ hours of work, then he charges $C=75h+125$ dollars for $(h+2)$ hours of work. We can substitute $h$ with $(h+2)-2$ to get the amount charged for $h$ hours of work. Thus, the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's work is $C=75(h+2-2)+125=75h+175$ dollars. 

Now, let's find the difference between the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's and Mr. Roland's work. The difference is $C_{\text{Sanchez}}-C_{\text{Roland}}=(75(h+2)+125)-(75h+175)=150$. 

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$ 150$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's start by finding out how many hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland. We can call this value $x$. Since the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job, then the number of hours worked for Ms. Sanchez is $x+2$. 

Using the equation given, we can calculate the cost of each job:
- Cost for Mr. Roland's job: $C = 75x + 125$
- Cost for Ms. Sanchez's job: $C = 75(x+2) + 125 = 75x + 225$

The difference in cost between the two jobs is:
$$(75x + 225) - (75x + 125) = 100$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.
 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Let's start by finding the amount that the electrician charged Mr. Roland. If he worked for $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job, we can substitute that into the equation to get $C = 75h + 125$. 

For Ms. Sanchez's job, we know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer, so the number of hours for her job is $h + 2$. Substituting that into the equation gives $C = 75(h+2) + 125$. 

To find the difference in the charges, we need to subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job: 

$$(75(h+2) + 125) - (75h + 125)$$
Simplifying this expression gives: 

$$75h + 150 - 75h - 125 = 25$$

So the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$25$ more than Mr. Roland.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
The total amount of energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories, which we can distribute among the three macronutrients as follows:

$4p$ food calories from protein
$9f$ food calories from fat
$4c$ food calories from carbohydrate

Since the total amount of food calories is 180, we have:

$4p+9f+4c=180$

Solving for $f$, we get:

$9f=180-4p-4c$
$f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 1:
We know that the 180 food calories come from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrates. Using the information in the table, we can write an equation in terms of $p$, $f$, and $c$:
$$4p+9f+4c=180$$
We want to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$. We can start by isolating $f$ on one side of the equation:
$$9f=180-4p-4c$$
$$f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$$
$$f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 2:
The 180 calories in the granola bar come from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate. Using the information from the table, the energy from the protein is $4p$ calories, the energy from the fat is $9f$ calories, and the energy from the carbohydrate is $4c$ calories. Therefore, we have the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{1}{9}(180-4p-4c)=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Thus, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 3:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ be the amounts of energy, in food calories, that come from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, respectively. Then we have the equations
\begin{align*}
E_p&=4p, \\
E_f&=9f, \\
E_c&=4c,
\end{align*}
since 1 gram of protein, fat, or carbohydrate provides 4, 9, or 4 food calories, respectively. We know that $E_p+E_f+E_c=180$, so substituting the above equations gives $4p+9f+4c=180$. Solving for $f$ gives
\begin{align*}
9f&=180-4p-4c \\
f&=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c).
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 4:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ denote the energy, in food calories, obtained from one gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. We are given that $E_p=4$, $E_f=9$, and $E_c=4$. Let $n_p$, $n_f$, and $n_c$ denote the number of grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in the granola bar, respectively. Then from the problem statement, we have $n_p E_p + n_f E_f + n_c E_c = 180$, or equivalently, $4p+9f+4c=180$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.
Response 5:
We know that the total energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories, and that this energy comes from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate. Using the table, we can write an equation in terms of food calories: $4p+9f+4c=180$. We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 9: $\frac{4}{9}p+f+\frac{4}{9}c=20$. We can then isolate $f$ by subtracting $\frac{4}{9}p$ and $\frac{4}{9}c$ from both sides, to get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 6:
The number of food calories from $p$ grams of protein is $4p$, the number of food calories from $f$ grams of fat is $9f$, and the number of food calories from $c$ grams of carbohydrate is $4c$. Since the total number of food calories is 180, we have $4p+9f+4c=180$. Solving for $f$ gives $f=\frac{1}{9}(180-4p-4c)=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 7:
Let's start by using the given information to set up an equation relating the total energy in the granola bar to the amounts of protein, fat, and carbohydrate it contains. From the table, we know that each gram of protein contributes 4 food calories, each gram of fat contributes 9 food calories, and each gram of carbohydrate contributes 4 food calories. Therefore, if the granola bar contains $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, we have:

$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$

To solve for $f$, we want to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by subtracting $4p + 4c$ from both sides:

$9f = 180 - 4p - 4c$

Now we can divide both sides by 9:

$f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}p - \frac{4}{9}c$

So the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
Response 8:
Since the granola bar contains $180$ food calories and each gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate contains $4$, $9$, and $4$ food calories, respectively, we know that $180=4p+9f+4c$. Dividing by $9$ gives $20=f/9+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$, so $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(A)}$ $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 9:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ denote the energy in food calories per gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. We have $180=E_p\cdot p+E_f\cdot f+E_c\cdot c$. Substituting the values from the table, we get $180=4p+9f+4c$. Solving for $f$ gives $f=\frac{1}{9}(180-4p-4c)=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.

Response 0:
To solve for $k$, we can isolate $k$ by squaring both sides of the equation. 

\begin{align*}
\sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\
\sqrt{k+2}&=x \\
(\sqrt{k+2})^2&=x^2 \\
k+2 &= x^2 \\
k &= x^2-2 \\
k &= 9^2-2 \\
k &= 79
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is (D) 79. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $$\sqrt{k+2}=x=9.$$Squaring both sides again, we get $$k+2=x^2=81.$$Therefore, $$k=81-2=79.$$ 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Squaring both sides of the equation $\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$, we get $k+2=x^2$. Substituting $x=9$ gives $k+2=81$. Thus, $k=79$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
To solve for $k$, we can start by isolating $k$ in the equation. We can do that by squaring both sides of the equation: $$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\ (\sqrt{k+2}-x)^2&=0^2 \\ k+2-2x\sqrt{k+2}+x^2&=0 \end{aligned}$$We know that $x=9$, so we can substitute that in: $$k+2-2(9)\sqrt{k+2}+9^2=0$$Simplifying: $$k+83-18\sqrt{k+2}=0$$Isolating the square root term: $$18\sqrt{k+2}=k+83$$Squaring both sides: $$\begin{aligned} (18\sqrt{k+2})^2&=(k+83)^2 \\ 324(k+2)&=k^2+166k+6889 \\ 324k+648&=k^2+166k+6889 \\ k^2-158k+6241&=0 \end{aligned}$$We can solve for $k$ using the quadratic formula: $$\begin{aligned} k&=\frac{-(-158)\pm\sqrt{(-158)^2-4(1)(6241)}}{2(1)} \\ &=\frac{158\pm\sqrt{24964}}{2} \\ &=\frac{158\pm158}{2} \\ &=79\text{ or }79 \end{aligned}$$Since $k$ cannot be negative, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:
$$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$
$$(\sqrt{k+2}-x)^2=0^2$$
$$(k+2)-2x\sqrt{k+2}+x^2=0$$
We know that $x=9$, therefore:
$$(k+2)-2(9)\sqrt{k+2}+(9)^2=0$$
$$(k+2)-18\sqrt{k+2}+81=0$$
Let $y=\sqrt{k+2}$, then the equation becomes:
$$y^2-18y+79=0$$
Solving for $y$:
$$y=\frac{18\pm\sqrt{(-18)^2-4(1)(79)}}{2(1)}$$
$$y=\frac{18\pm\sqrt{36}}{2}$$
$$y=9\pm3$$
Since $y=\sqrt{k+2}$, then:
$$\sqrt{k+2}=9+3=12$$ or $$\sqrt{k+2}=9-3=6$$
Squaring both sides of the equations above, we have:
$$k+2=12^2=144$$ or $$k+2=6^2=36$$
Therefore, the value of $k$ is:
$$k=144-2=142$$ or $$k=36-2=34$$
Answer: Answer("A") or Answer("C")
Response 5:
We can start by isolating $k$ in the equation given. 

$$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$

Adding $x$ to both sides, we get:

$$\sqrt{k+2}=x$$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$$(\sqrt{k+2})^2=x^2$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$k+2=x^2$$

Substituting $x=9$ into the equation above, we get:

$$k+2=9^2=81$$

Solving for $k$, we get:

$$k=81-2=79$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
To solve the equation, we can add $x$ to both sides and then square both sides of the equation. 

$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0\\ \sqrt{k+2}&=x\\ \sqrt{k+2}&=9\\ k+2&=81\\ k&=79 \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
First, we can add $x$ to both sides of the equation to get:
$$\sqrt{k+2}=x$$
Then, we can square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:
$$(\sqrt{k+2})^2=x^2$$
$$k+2=x^2$$
Now we can substitute $x=9$ into the equation to solve for $k$:
$$k+2=9^2$$
$$k+2=81$$
$$k=79$$
So the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:
$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\ \sqrt{k+2}&=x \\ (\sqrt{k+2})^2&=x^2 \\ k+2&=x^2 \\ k&=x^2-2 \end{aligned}$$
Now, substituting $x=9$ into the equation above, we get:
$$k=9^2-2=79$$
Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Squaring both sides of the equation, we have: 

$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\ \sqrt{k+2}&=x \\ (\sqrt{k+2})^2&=x^2 \\ k+2&=x^2 \\ k&=x^2-2 \end{aligned}$$

Substituting $x=9$, we get:

$$\begin{aligned} k&=9^2-2 \\ &=79 \end{aligned}$$

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
Response 0:
To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that will make $a$ closest to $1,000$ in the given equation. We can start by plugging in each of the answer choices into the equation and calculating the corresponding value of $a$.

A: $$a=1,052+1.08(-46)=1,000.32$$
B: $$a=1,052+1.08(-48)=998.56$$
C: $$a=1,052+1.08(-49)=999.36$$
D: $$a=1,052+1.08(-50)=998.56$$

The closest value of $a$ to $1,000$ is obtained when $t = -48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, which is choice B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
We can solve the problem by finding which value of $t$ makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can do this by finding the absolute value of the difference between 1,000 and $a$ and then minimizing that difference. We can write $|1000-a|$ as $|1000-(1052+1.08t)|=|48-1.08t|$. We want to minimize this expression, which means we want to find the value of $t$ that makes $48-1.08t=0$. Solving for $t$ gives $t=44.44$, which is closest to $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's substitute each temperature option into the equation to see which one results in a value closest to 1,000:
- For option A: $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-46) \approx 500$.
- For option B: $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-48) \approx 485$.
- For option C: $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-49) \approx 478$.
- For option D: $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-50) \approx 471$.

Action: Answer("B") 

Therefore, the air temperature that results in the speed of a sound wave closest to 1,000 feet per second is $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.
Response 3:
We can solve this problem by substituting the given values in the formula and finding the value of $t$ that gives $a$ closest to $1,000$.

$$a=1,052+1.08 t$$

Substituting $a=1,000$, we get:

$$1,000=1,052+1.08 t$$

Solving for $t$, we get:

$$t \approx -5.18$$

Therefore, the air temperature closest to $1,000$ feet per second is approximately $-5.18^\circ \mathrm{F}$. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
We can solve for $t$ in the given formula to get $t=\frac{a-1,052}{1.08}$. We want to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can substitute $a=1,000$ into the formula and solve for $t$: $1,000=1,052+1.08 t \Rightarrow t \approx -5.19$. We want to choose the temperature closest to $-5.19^\circ \mathrm{F}$. We can see that the closest temperature is $-48^\circ \mathrm{F}$, so the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
We can solve the problem by finding the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can do this by finding the absolute difference between $a$ and 1,000 and then minimizing it by finding the value of $t$ that makes this difference as small as possible. We can write this absolute difference as $|a-1000|$. 

Now, we want to minimize $|a-1000|$, which is equivalent to minimizing $(a-1000)^2$. We can find the minimum of this expression by setting its derivative with respect to $t$ equal to zero:

$$\frac{d}{d t}\left[(a-1000)^2\right]=2(a-1000)\frac{d a}{d t}=2(a-1000)(1.08)$$

Setting this equal to zero, we get:

$$2(a-1000)(1.08)=0$$

Solving for $a$, we get:

$$a=1000$$

Substituting this into the formula for $a$, we get:

$$1000=1,052+1.08 t$$

Solving for $t$, we get:

$$t\approx -49.63$$

The closest temperature in the choices to this value is $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To solve the problem, we need to substitute the values of the given choices in the formula and find the temperature that gives a value closest to 1000. 

Action: Since $a=1,052+1.08 t$, we can find $a$ for each choice: 
- For choice A, $a=1,052+1.08(-46) \approx 962.32$
- For choice B, $a=1,052+1.08(-48) \approx 957.76$
- For choice C, $a=1,052+1.08(-49) \approx 955.48$
- For choice D, $a=1,052+1.08(-50) \approx 953.2$

Therefore, the speed of sound is closest to 1000 feet per second at air temperature $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}}$.

Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 4
  D: 8
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")  

Expanding the right hand side, we get: $$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
Simplifying, we get: $$2ax-15=8x+10$$
Moving all the terms to one side, we get: $$2ax-8x=25$$
Factoring out $x$, we get: $$(2a-8)x=25$$
Since the equation has no solution, $2a-8$ must be equal to zero. Solving for $a$, we get $a=4$.
Response 1:

Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B") 

To solve the equation, we first distribute on the right side: 

$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$(2a-8)x=25$$

Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, we know that the coefficient of $x$ must be 0. Therefore, $2a-8=0$ and $a=4$. 

Thus, the answer is (C) 4.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B") 

To solve the equation, we first distribute on the right-hand side: $$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5.$$Simplifying the right-hand side gives $$2ax-15=8x+10.$$Bringing all the $x$ terms to the left-hand side gives $$2ax-8x=25.$$Factor out $x$ on the left-hand side: $$x(2a-8)=25.$$Since the equation has no solutions, we know that $2a-8\neq 0$, which means $a\neq 4$. Thus, the only answer choice that works is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 2}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can simplify the equation as follows:
$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$(2a-8)x=25$$
$$x=\frac{25}{2a-8}$$
Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, the denominator $2a-8$ must be equal to 0. Therefore, $a=4$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can start by simplifying both sides of the equation:
$$2ax-15=3(x+5)+5(x-1)$$
$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$2ax=8x+25$$
$$x=\frac{4a+25}{a-4}$$
Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, the denominator of the right-hand side must be equal to zero. Therefore, we have:
$$a-4=0$$
$$a=4$$
Thus, the value of $a$ is 4, which corresponds to choice (B).
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B") 

Expanding the right-hand side, we have: $$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
which simplifies to: $$2ax-15=8x+10$$
Rearranging, we get: $$(2a-8)x=25$$
Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, we know that $2a-8 \neq 0$. Therefore, we can solve for $a$: $$2a-8 \neq 0 \Rightarrow 2a \neq 8 \Rightarrow a \neq 4$$
So the only possible value of $a$ is 2.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B") 

Expanding the right-hand side, we get: 

$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$(2a-8)x=25$$

Since there is no value of $x$ that satisfies the equation, we know that $(2a-8)$ must be equal to zero (otherwise, we could solve for $x$). Therefore, we have:

$$(2a-8)=0$$
$$2a=8$$
$$a=4$$

Thus, the answer is (B) 4.

Question: The function $f$ is defined by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$. The graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following intervals contains the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-4<x<-3$
  B: $-3<x<1$
  C: $1<x<3$
  D: $3<x<4$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Explanation: We can expand the given quadratic function to get $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. Notice that this is in the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$, where $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ is given by $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2}=-2$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$, which is in the interval $-4<x<-3$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$, we can use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $ax^2+bx+c$ is the general form of a quadratic function. In this case, $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$, so $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but rather the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=-2$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("-2") 

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola of the form $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$ is $h$. We can rewrite $f$ as $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. Completing the square gives $f(x)=(x+2)^2-1$. Thus, the vertex has $x$-coordinate $-2$. The answer is not one of the choices, but the closest interval is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -4<x<-3}$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("-2") 

We can expand $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$. We can see that this is a quadratic function, which means that its graph is a parabola. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is given by $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, we have $a=1$ and $b=4$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but rather the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Explanation:

We can expand $f(x)$ to get $f(x)=x^{2}+4 x+3$. This is a quadratic function whose graph is a parabola. The vertex of the parabola is at the point $(-b / 2 a, c-b^{2} / 4 a)$, where $a=1, b=4,$ and $c=3$ are the coefficients of the quadratic function. Substituting these values, we get the $x$-coordinate of the vertex to be $-b / 2 a=-4 / 2=-2$. Therefore, the answer is A: $-4<x<-3$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("-2") 

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ is $-\frac{b}{2a}$, where the quadratic function is in the form of $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. In this case, $f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 3$. Thus, $-\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{4}{2(1)} = -2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but rather the value $x=-2$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("-2")
The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ is $-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ in the quadratic expression of $f$, respectively. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$, so $-\frac{b}{2a}=-2$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola, we use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic function in standard form. In this case, $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$ and $b=4$. Thus, $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$. We see that $-4<x<-3$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("-2")  

We can write the function as $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, we can use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a=1$ and $b=4$. So, $x=-\frac{4}{2}=-2$, which is in the interval $-4<x<-3$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -4<x<-3}$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Solution: The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola $f(x) = (x+3)(x+1)$, is given by $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$ where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic term and the linear term, respectively. In this case, we have $a=1$ and $b=4$, so $x=-\frac{4}{2}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but rather the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=-2$.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by $100$ gives $10x+20y=18(x+y),$ which simplifies to $2x=4y$ or $x=2y.$

Since Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, he must use $x+y=100+x$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution. Substituting $x=2y$ into the equation gives $3y=100,$ so $y=100/3.$ Thus, Clayton must use $x=2y=200/3$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(C) }50.$
Response 1:
We can begin by plugging in the given values and solving for $x$:

$$0.10 x+0.20 (100)=0.18(x+100)$$

Simplifying the equation yields:

$$0.10 x+20=0.18x+18$$

$$2=0.08x$$

$$x=25$$

Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }25}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
Response 2:
First, we need to substitute $y=100$ into the equation so that we only have one variable to solve for. 

$$0.10 x + 0.20(100) = 0.18(x+100)$$
$$0.10 x + 20 = 0.18x + 18$$
$$0.02x = 2$$
$$x = 100$$

Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 100}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")  
We can start the problem by substituting $y=100$ into the equation and then solve for $x$.
\begin{align*}
0.10 x+0.20 (100)&=0.18(x+100)\\
0.10 x+20&=0.18x+18\\
0.08x&=2\\
x&=25
\end{align*}
Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 50}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can begin by solving for $x$ in the equation given. 

\begin{align*}
0.10 x+0.20 y&=0.18(x+y) \\
0.10 x+0.20 y&=0.18x+0.18y \\
0.02 x&=0.02y \\
x&=y
\end{align*}

Since Clayton used 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, we know that $y=100$. Therefore, Clayton must use 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution and 100 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution to create the desired solution. However, the question asks for how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution Clayton must use, and we have found that the answer is 100 milliliters minus the 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, which is equal to $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }50}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")  
We can start by using algebra to solve for $x$ in terms of $y$:
$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x+y)$$
$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18x + 0.18y$$
$$0.02x = 0.02y$$
$$x = y$$
This tells us that we need to use equal amounts of the $10 \%$ and $20 \%$ saline solutions. Since we are already using 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ saline solution, we need to also use 100 milliliters of the $10 \%$ saline solution. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }50}$.
Response 8:
We can start by substituting $y=100$ in the given equation and solve for $x$:
\begin{align*}
0.10x+0.20(100)&=0.18(x+100)\\
0.10x+20&=0.18x+18\\
0.08x&=-2\\
x&=-25
\end{align*}
Since $x$ represents the number of milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution, we must have a positive value for $x$. Therefore, Clayton must use 25 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.

Question: Lani spent $15 \%$ of her 8-hour workday in meetings. How many minutes of her workday did she spend in meetings?
Choices:
  A: 1.2
  B: 15
  C: 48
  D: 72
Response 0:
To solve this problem, we need to find $15 \%$ of 8 hours and then convert it to minutes.

Action: Answer("C") 

$15 \%$ of 8 hours $= (0.15) \cdot 8 \text{ hours} = 1.2 \text{ hours}$ 

$1.2 \text{ hours} \cdot 60 \frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}} = 72 \text{ minutes}$ 

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we need to convert the percentage to an actual amount of time. 

Action: Answer("72")

Explanation: 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Lani's workday is 8 hours $\times$ 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes. 

Lani spent $15 \%$ of her workday in meetings, so the amount of time spent in meetings is: 

$15 \% \times 480 = \frac{15}{100} \times 480 = 72$ minutes. 

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how many hours Lani spent in meetings. We can do this by multiplying $15 \%$ by 8 hours: 

$$ 0.15 \times 8 \text{ hours} = 1.2 \text{ hours} $$

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1.2 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 

$$ 1.2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }72} \text{ minutes} $$

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
To solve the problem, we need to find $15 \%$ of 8 hours and convert it to minutes. 

$15 \%$ of 8 hours is $0.15 \times 8 = 1.2$ hours. 

To convert hours to minutes, we can multiply by 60: 

$1.2 \times 60 = 72$ 

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To convert a percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100. So, $15 \% = 0.15$. 

In 8 hours, there are 8 x 60 = 480 minutes. 

To find how many minutes Lani spent in meetings, we multiply the total number of minutes in her workday (480) by the decimal equivalent of the percent of her workday spent in meetings (0.15). 

Action: Answer("72")  

So, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
We can use the two data points provided to form two linear equations and solve for the coefficients. One point is $(128,000, 950)$ and the other is $(450,000, 3,365)$. Converting the first point to thousands of dollars, we get $(128, 0.95)$ and converting the second point to thousands of dollars, we get $(450, 3.365)$. The slope of the line is $\frac{3.365-0.95}{450-128}= \frac{2.415}{322} = \frac{12075}{1610} = \frac{2415}{322}$. Using the point-slope form of a linear equation, we have $r-0.95=\frac{2415}{322}(p-128)$. Solving for $r$ gives $r=\frac{2415}{322}p-870.5 \approx 2.5p-870$, which is closest to choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$. 

Note: We can ignore the other data points since they are not needed to form the linear equation.
Response 1:
The slope of the linear function represents the increase in monthly rental price for each additional thousand dollars paid for the property. We can find the slope by choosing any two points from the table and calculating the difference in rental price divided by the difference in purchase price. For example, using Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive: 

slope $= (1310-950)/(176-128)=360/48=7.5$

Therefore, the linear function is of the form $r(p) = 7.5p + b$. To find the y-intercept $b$, we can substitute one of the points and solve for $b$. Using Clearwater Lane: 

$950 = 7.5(128) + b$

$b = 950 - 960 = -10$

Thus, the linear function is $r(p) = 7.5p - 10$, which is represented by choice (D).

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
We can begin by finding the slope of the line. The slope represents the rate of change of the monthly rental price with respect to the purchase price. To find the slope, we can choose two points from the table and use the formula: slope $= \frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$. For example, using the first and fourth properties, we have:
\begin{align*}
\text{slope} &= \frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x} \\
&= \frac{1040 - 950}{140 - 128} \\
&= \frac{90}{12} \\
&= 7.5
\end{align*}
So the slope of the linear function is 7.5. We can also find the $y$-intercept by choosing any point and solving for $b$ in the equation $y=mx+b$. Using the first property, we have:
\begin{align*}
950 &= 7.5(128) + b \\
b &= 950 - 960 \\
b &= -10
\end{align*}
So the $y$-intercept is $-10$. Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is:
$$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$$
Thus, the answer is $\textbf{(D)}$.
Response 3:
To find the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, we need to find the equation of the line that passes through two points. We can use any two points from the table. Let's use the first and fourth points: $(128, 950)$ and $(140, 1040)$. 

The slope of the line passing through these two points is:

$$m = \frac{1040 - 950}{140 - 128} = \frac{90}{12} = 7.5$$

The y-intercept of the line passing through these two points is:

$$b = 950 - 7.5 \cdot 128 = -10$$

Therefore, the equation of the line is:

$$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$$

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 4:
The slope of the function would be the monthly rental increase per thousand dollars of purchase price. We can calculate this slope by choosing two points from the table and using the slope formula. Let's choose the first and second properties:
$$\text{slope}=\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=\frac{360}{48}=7.5$$
The slope is 7.5. The y-intercept is the rental price when the purchase price is zero, which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and D. Now, we can use the slope and one of the points to find the y-intercept. Let's use the first point:
$$950=7.5(128)+b$$
$$b=-770$$
Therefore, the equation of the linear function is $r(p)=7.5p-770$, which is equivalent to choice $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}}$.
Response 5:
We can use the two given data points for each property to find the slope of the line and the $y$-intercept. For example, for the first property, we have the two points $(128,000, 950)$ and $(0,0)$. The slope is $\frac{950-0}{128-0}=\frac{475}{64}$ and the $y$-intercept is $(0,0)$. Thus the equation of the line is $r(p)=\frac{475}{64}p+0=\frac{475}{64}p$. Converting to thousands of dollars, we get $r(p)=\frac{475}{64}\cdot \frac{1}{1000}p=\frac{19}{256}p$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } r(p)=2.5p-870}$.
Response 6:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. For example, between Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive, the rental price increased by $1310-950=360$ dollars, while the purchase price increased by $176-128=48$ thousand dollars. Therefore, the slope between Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive is $\frac{360}{48}=7.5$. We can check that this holds for all pairs of consecutive properties. 

In addition, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the $y$-intercept $b$. For example, using the pair of properties Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive, we have that the rental price $r$ is $950$ when the purchase price $p$ is $128$ thousand dollars. Therefore, using the point-slope form of a linear equation, we have:

$$r-950=7.5(p-128)$$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$$r(p)=7.5p-10$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }r(p)=7.5p-10}$.
Response 7:
We can start by finding the slope of the line, which represents the rate of change of the rental price with respect to the purchase price. We can choose two points from the table, for example, $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$. The difference in rental price is $1310 - 950 = 360$, and the difference in purchase price is $176 - 128 = 48$. Therefore, the slope of the line is $360/48 = 7.5$. 

Next, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the y-intercept. Using the point $(128, 950)$ and the slope $7.5$, we get:

$$r - 950 = 7.5(p - 128)$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$r(p) = 7.5p - 870$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }r(p)=2.5p-870}$.
Response 8:
The slope of the line (i.e. the rate of change of rental price with respect to purchase price) is the rental price divided by the purchase price. For example, for the first property, the slope is $\frac{950}{128}=7.421875$. We can calculate the slope for each property and find the average slope, which is approximately $7.4$. Therefore, the equation of the line is of the form $r(p)=7.4p+b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. To find $b$, we can plug in the coordinates of one of the points, say $(128,950)$, and solve for $b$. We get $950=7.4\cdot 128+b$, which gives $b=-870$. Therefore, the function that represents the relationship is:

$$r(p)=7.4p-870$$

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
We can use the formula for the equation of a line, $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. In this case, the slope represents the increase in monthly rental price for every thousand dollars increase in purchase price. We can find the slope by choosing two points from the table and using the formula $m=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\text{change in }r}{\text{change in }p}$. Let's use the points for Clearwater Lane and Glenview Street: $(p_1,r_1)=(128,950)$ and $(p_2,r_2)=(140,1040)$. The slope is $m=\frac{r_2-r_1}{p_2-p_1}=\frac{1040-950}{140-128}=\frac{90}{12}=7.5$. Therefore, the linear function is of the form $r(p)=7.5p+b$. To find $b$, we can use any point from the table and solve for $b$. Let's use Clearwater Lane: $950=7.5(128)+b \Rightarrow b=-870$. Thus, the function is $r(p)=7.5p-870$.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Nate walks 25 meters in 13.7 seconds. If he walks at this same rate, which of the following is closest to the distance he will walk in 4 minutes?
Choices:
  A: 150 meters
  B: 450 meters
  C: 700 meters
  D: 1,400 meters
Response 0:
To solve the problem, we can first find Nate's speed in meters per second by dividing the distance he walked by the time it took him: 

25 meters ÷ 13.7 seconds ≈ 1.82 meters per second

Then, we can use this speed to find the distance he will walk in 4 minutes (which is 240 seconds):

1.82 meters per second × 240 seconds = 436.8 meters

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the closest answer choice is:

Action: Answer("B") 450 meters
Response 1:
To find the answer, we need to convert 4 minutes to seconds, then use a proportion to find the distance Nate will walk. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so 4 minutes is:
4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds

Now we can set up a proportion:
25 meters / 13.7 seconds = x / 240 seconds

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
25 * 240 = 13.7 * x
x = (25 * 240) / 13.7
x ≈ 437 meters

The closest answer choice is B: 450 meters. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
To solve the problem, we need to find Nate's speed in meters per second and then multiply this by the number of seconds in 4 minutes. 

Speed = Distance ÷ Time

Nate's speed = 25 meters ÷ 13.7 seconds = 1.8248 meters per second (rounded to four decimal places)

4 minutes = 4 × 60 = 240 seconds

Distance Nate will walk = Speed × Time = 1.8248 meters per second × 240 seconds = 437.952 meters (rounded to three decimal places)

Therefore, the closest answer is B: 450 meters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
To solve this problem, we can use unit conversion. 

Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 

We can start by finding Nate's walking speed in meters per second:

25 meters / 13.7 seconds ≈ 1.82 meters per second

Then, we can use this speed to find how far Nate will walk in 4 minutes:

1.82 meters per second × 240 seconds = 436.8 meters

Rounding this to the nearest hundred gives us 700 meters, which is closest to choice (C).
Response 6:
To solve this problem, we need to convert 4 minutes into seconds since we have the speed (meters per second). There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so in 4 minutes, there are:
4 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds

Next, we need to find Nate's speed in meters per second:
Speed = Distance / Time
25 meters / 13.7 seconds = 1.8248 meters per second

Finally, we can find the distance Nate will walk in 240 seconds (4 minutes) at this rate:
Distance = Speed x Time
1.8248 meters/second x 240 seconds = 437.952 meters

The closest answer choice is B: 450 meters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
To convert 4 minutes to seconds, we multiply by 60: 

4 minutes = 4 × 60 seconds = 240 seconds

Nate's rate is 25 meters in 13.7 seconds. 

To find how far he will walk in 240 seconds, we can set up a proportion: 

25 meters / 13.7 seconds = x meters / 240 seconds

Solving for x, 

x = (25 meters / 13.7 seconds) × 240 seconds = 439.42 meters

The closest answer choice is B: 450 meters.

Therefore, 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
To solve this problem, we can start by finding Nate's speed in meters per second. 

Speed = distance / time
Speed = 25 meters / 13.7 seconds
Speed ≈ 1.82 meters per second

Next, we can use this speed to find how far Nate will walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds). 

Distance = speed x time
Distance = 1.82 meters per second x 240 seconds
Distance ≈ 437 meters

Therefore, the closest answer is B: 450 meters.

Action: Answer("B")

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& b=2.35+0.25 x \\& c=1.75+0.40 x\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ represent the price per pound, in dollars, of beef and chicken, respectively, $x$ weeks after July 1 during last summer. What was the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 2.60$
  B: $\$ 2.85$
  C: $\$ 2.95$
  D: $\$ 3.35$
Response 0:
We need to find the value of $x$ when $b=c$. Substituting the given expressions, we have: $$2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$$Solving for $x$, we get $x=6$. Now, substituting this value of $x$ in the expression for $b$, we get: $$b=2.35+0.25(6)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$$
Response 1:
We can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$ to find the week when the prices are equal: $$\begin{aligned} 2.35+0.25 x &= 1.75+0.40 x \\ 0.15 x &= 0.60 \\ x &= 4 \end{aligned}$$ So the prices are equal 4 weeks after July 1. We can substitute $x=4$ into either equation to find the price per pound: $$b = 2.35 + 0.25(4) = 2.35 + 1 = 3.35$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \$3.35}$.
Response 2:
We are given that the price of beef per pound is equal to the price of chicken per pound when $b=c$. Substituting the given equations, we get $$2.35+0.25x = 1.75+0.40x.$$Solving for $x$, we get $x=12$. Substituting $x=12$ into either equation to find the price, we get $$b=2.35+0.25\cdot 12 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \$ 3.35}.$$
Response 3:
We need to find the value of $x$ at which $b=c$. Therefore, we can set up the equation $2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$ and solve for $x$. 

$$\begin{aligned}0.15x&=0.60\\x&=4\end{aligned}$$

Now that we know $x=4$, we can substitute it into either one of the equations to find the price per pound of beef (or chicken) at that time. Using $b=2.35+0.25x$, we get:

$$\begin{aligned}b&=2.35+0.25(4)\\&=3.35\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \$3.35}$.
Response 4:
We are given that the price of beef per pound is equal to the price of chicken per pound, so we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$:

$$2.35 + 0.25x = 1.75 + 0.40x$$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$$0.15x = 0.60$$

$$x = 4$$

So the prices are:

$$b = 2.35 + 0.25(4) = 2.35 + 1.00 = 3.35$$

$$c = 1.75 + 0.40(4) = 1.75 + 1.60 = 3.35$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } \$3.35}$.
Response 5:
First, we will set $b=c$ and solve for $x$.
$$\begin{aligned}2.35+0.25x&=1.75+0.40x\\0.15x&=0.60\\x&=4\end{aligned}$$
Now, we can substitute $x=4$ into either equation to find the price per pound of beef at that time.
$$b=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$ 2.95}$$
Response 6:
From the given equations, we are given that $b=c$. Setting the two equations equal to each other, we get \begin{align*}
2.35+0.25x&=1.75+0.40x \\
\Rightarrow 0.15x&=0.60 \\
\Rightarrow x&=4
\end{align*}Substituting $x=4$ in the expression for $b$, we get $b=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$.
Response 7:
We can set $b=c$ and solve for $x$ to determine the week when the prices were equal. Then we can substitute that value of $x$ into either equation to find the price per pound.

$$\begin{aligned}2.35+0.25x&=1.75+0.40x\\0.15x&=0.60\\x&=4\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the prices were equal 4 weeks after July 1. Substituting $x=4$ into the equation for $b$ gives:

$$b=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \textdollar2.95}$$
Response 8:
We are given that $b=c$. Substituting the given equations for $b$ and $c$, we have $$2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x.$$Solving for $x$, we get $x=12$. Substituting $x=12$ into either equation for $b$ or $c$, we get $$b=c=2.35+0.25(12)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}.$$
Response 9:
Substitute $b$ for $c$ and solve for $x$. $$\begin{aligned} b&=c \\ 2.35+0.25 x &=1.75+0.40 x \\ 0.15 x &=0.60 \\ x &=4 \end{aligned} $$Substitute $x=4$ into $b$ and solve for $b$. $$\begin{aligned} b &=2.35+0.25 x \\ &=2.35+0.25 (4) \\ &=3.35 \end{aligned} $$Therefore, the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken was $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \$ 3.35}$.

Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38

Let's use the formula for conditional probability: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$. Let $A$ be the event that the user answered "Always" and $B$ be the event that the user did not answer "Never". Then, $B =$ Rarely + Often + Always $= 24.3\% + 13.5\% + 30.9\% = 68.7\%$. The probability that a user answered "Always" and did not answer "Never" is $P(A \cap B) = P(A) - P(\text{Always and Never}) = 30.9\% - 0\% = 30.9\%$. Therefore, $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{30.9\%}{68.7\%} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}$.

&=\frac{0.309}{1-0.313}\\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.38}.
\end{align*}
Response 2:
Let's first find the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never." This would be the sum of the percentages for the other three answer choices: $24.3 \% + 13.5 \% + 30.9 \% = 68.7 \%$. 

Next, we want to find the probability that a user answered "Always" given that they did not answer "Never." This would be the percentage of users who answered "Always" out of the total percentage who did not answer "Never": $\frac{30.9 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.45$ 

Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}$.
Response 3:
Let's consider the tablet users who did not answer "Never." This group represents $100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$ of all tablet users. Out of this group, the percentage of tablet users who answered "Always" is $\dfrac{30.9 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.449 \approx \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 0.45}$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(C)}$.
Response 4:
Let's use the formula for conditional probability: 

P(Always | Not Never) = P(Always and Not Never) / P(Not Never)

From the table, we can see that the percentage of users who answered "Always and Not Never" is $30.9\%$. The percentage of users who answered "Not Never" is $100\% - 31.3\% = 68.7\%$. 

Therefore, 

P(Always | Not Never) = 30.9% / 68.7% = 0.449, which is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}$.
Response 5:
Let's first calculate the total percent of tablet users who did not answer "Never". This is equal to $100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$. 

Now, we need to find the probability that a tablet user answered "Always" given that the tablet user did not answer "Never". This is a conditional probability, and we can find it using the formula:

$$P(\text{Always} \mid \text{not Never}) = \frac{P(\text{Always} \cap \text{not Never})}{P(\text{not Never})}$$

From the table, we can see that the percent of tablet users who answered "Always" and did not answer "Never" is $30.9 \%$. Therefore, we have:

$$P(\text{Always} \mid \text{not Never}) = \frac{30.9 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.45$$

So the closest answer choice is (C) 0.45. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We are asked to find $P(A|B),$ which is the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." 

We can use Bayes' Theorem to find $P(A|B):$ 

\begin{align*}
P(A|B)&=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\
&=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|A^c)P(A^c)} \\
&=\frac{(0.309)(0.309)}{(0.309)(0.309)+(0.243+0.135)(1-0.309)} \\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 0.45}
\end{align*}
Response 7:
Let $A$ denote the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ denote the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We are looking for the conditional probability $P(A|B).$ We can use Bayes' Theorem to write \begin{align*}
P(A|B) &= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\
&= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|A^c)P(A^c)} \\
&= \frac{(1)(0.309)}{(1)(0.309)+(0.657)(0.687)} \\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.38}.
\end{align*}
Response 8:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B).$ We know that $P(A)=0.309$ and $P(Never)=0.313.$ Therefore, $P(B)=1-P(Never)=0.687.$ We also know that $P(A \cap B)=P(A)=0.309.$ Thus, \begin{align*}
P(A|B)&=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \\
&=\frac{0.309}{0.687} \\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}.
\end{align*}
Response 9:
Let's first calculate the probability of a tablet user not answering "Never." This would be the sum of the percentages for Rarely, Often, and Always: $24.3 \% + 13.5 \% + 30.9 \% = 68.7 \%$. 

Now, we need to calculate the probability of a tablet user answering "Always" given that they did not answer "Never." This would be the percentage of people who answered "Always" divided by the percentage of people who did not answer "Never": $\frac{30.9 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.45$. 

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (C) 0.45.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")  

Solution: 

We can solve this system of equations by using elimination method. If we multiply the first equation by $3$ and the second equation by $2$, we can eliminate $y$ by adding the two equations. We get:

$$\begin{aligned}& 6 x-9 y=-42 \\& 6 x-4 y=-12\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

$$-5y=-30 \Rightarrow y=6$$

Substituting $y=6$ in the second equation, we get:

$$3x-2(6)=-6 \Rightarrow 3x=6 \Rightarrow x=2$$

Therefore, $(x,y)=(2,6)$ and $x-y=2-6=-4$. So the answer is (C).
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B") 

To solve the system of equations, we can use elimination method. If we multiply the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$, we get:

$$\begin{aligned}&4x-6y=-28 \\&9x-6y=-18\end{aligned}$$

Now, if we subtract the second equation from the first, the $y$ terms cancel out and we get:

$$-5x=-10$$

Therefore, $x=2$. Substituting this value in the second equation, we get:

$$3(2)-2y=-6 \implies -2y=-12 \implies y=6$$

Finally, $x-y=2-6=\boxed{-4}$
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can solve the system of equations using either elimination or substitution method. Using elimination, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, then subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate $y$:
$$\begin{aligned} &\begin{aligned} &2x-3y=-14 \\ &\times 2 \end{aligned} \\ \implies &4x-6y=-28 \\ \end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned} &\begin{aligned} &3x-2y=-6 \\ &\times 3 \end{aligned} \\ \implies &9x-6y=-18 \\ \end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned} &4x-6y=-28 \\ &-(9x-6y=-18) \\ \implies &-5x=-10 \\ \implies &x=2 \end{aligned}$$
Substituting $x=2$ into either equation, we can solve for $y$:
$$\begin{aligned} &3x-2y=-6 \\ \implies &3(2)-2y=-6 \\ \implies &-2y=-12 \\ \implies &y=6 \end{aligned}$$
Therefore, $(x,y)=(2,6)$ and $x-y=2-6=-4$. Hence, the answer is (C) $-4$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B") 

One way to solve the system of equations is to multiply the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$, and then add the two equations to eliminate $y$:
$$\begin{aligned}& 4x-6y=-28 \\& 9x-6y=-18\end{aligned}$$
Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $-5x=-10$, which implies $x=2$. Substituting $x=2$ into either equation, we get $y=3$. Therefore, $x-y=-1-3=-4$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D") 

To solve this system of equations, we can use elimination method. If we multiply the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$, we get
$$\begin{aligned}& 4 x-6 y=-28 \\& 9 x-6 y=-18\end{aligned}$$
Then, if we subtract the first equation from the second, we get $5x=10$, which implies $x=2$. Substituting $x=2$ into the second equation, we get $3(2)-2y=-6$, which implies $y=6$. Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")  

Solution: 
We can solve this system of equations by using elimination. If we multiply the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$, we can then add the equations to eliminate $y$:
$$
\begin{aligned} &2 x-3 y=-14 \\ &3 x-2 y=-6 \end{aligned}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\begin{aligned} &4 x-6 y=-28 \\ &9 x-6 y=-18 \end{aligned}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
5x=-10\quad\Rightarrow\quad x=-2
$$
Substituting $x=-2$ into the first equation, we can solve for $y$:
$$
2 x-3 y=-14 \quad\Rightarrow\quad -4-3y=-14 \quad\Rightarrow\quad y=10/3
$$
Therefore, $(x,y)=(-2,10/3)$ and $x-y=-2-10/3=-16/3$. Rounding to the nearest integer, we get $-5$, which is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 8}$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can solve the system of equations using elimination or substitution method. Using the substitution method, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ from the first equation: $2x-3y=-14 \Rightarrow 2x=3y-14 \Rightarrow x=\frac{3}{2}y-7$. Substituting this expression for $x$ into the second equation gives $3\left(\frac{3}{2}y-7\right)-2y=-6$, which simplifies to $y=2$. Substituting $y=2$ back into $x=\frac{3}{2}y-7$ gives $x=-1$. Therefore, $x-y=-1-2=-3$. However, none of the answer choices is $-3$. To get the closest answer, we can select the answer choice that is closest to $-3$, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }8}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")  

To solve this system of equations, we can use the elimination method. If we multiply the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$, we can eliminate $y$.
$$\begin{aligned}& 4 x-6 y=-28 \\& 9 x-6 y=-18\end{aligned}$$
Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $-5x = -10$, which implies $x=2$. Substituting this value of $x$ into either of the original equations, we get $y=4$. Therefore, $x-y=2-4=-2$, and the answer is $\boxed{\text{(B)}\,-8}$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D") 

Here's how to solve the system of equations: 

We can multiply the first equation by $-3$ and the second equation by $-2$ to get

$$\begin{aligned}-6x+9y&=42 \\-6x+4y&=12\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $5y=30$, so $y=6$. 

Substituting this value of $y$ into the first equation, we get $2x-18=-14$, so $x=2$. 

Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("D")  

To solve this system of equations, we can use either elimination or substitution method. Here, we will use the elimination method.

Multiplying the first equation by $3$ and the second equation by $2$, we get:

$$\begin{aligned}&6x-9y=-42 \\&6x-4y=-12\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

$$-5y=-30 \Rightarrow y=6$$

Substituting $y=6$ in either equation, we get:

$$2x-3(6)=-14 \Rightarrow x=2$$

Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$, so the answer is (C).

Response 5:
To solve the problem, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line. The equation is given by $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line. Since the line passes through the origin, we have $x_1 = 0$ and $y_1 = 0$. Substituting these values and the slope $m = \frac{1}{7}$, we get $y - 0 = \frac{1}{7}(x - 0)$, which simplifies to $y = \frac{1}{7} x$. Therefore, the point $(7,7)$ lies on the line. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
We can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to solve this problem. The equation of a line with slope $m$ passing through point $(x_1,y_1)$ is given by $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$.

Since the line passes through the origin, we have $x_1 = 0$ and $y_1 = 0$. Substituting $m = \frac{1}{7}$, we get $y = \frac{1}{7} x$ as the equation of the line.

Now we can check which of the given points lie on this line by substituting the coordinates into the equation. We get:

$A: (0,7) \Rightarrow y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 0 = 0 \neq 7$

$B: (1,7) \Rightarrow y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{7} \neq 7$

$C: (7,7) \Rightarrow y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 7 = 1 = 7$

$D: (14,2) \Rightarrow y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 14 = 2 \neq \frac{2}{7}$

Therefore, the point that lies on the line is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } (7,7)}$.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 0:
Let's say Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. We know that the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270. So, the total number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal is $270 - 240x$. We also know that one serving of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories. So, we can set up the equation: 

$$\frac{3}{4}(210) + \frac{1}{4}(240)(x) = 270$$

Simplifying this equation gives us:

$$157.5 + 60x = 270$$

Subtracting 157.5 from both sides, and then dividing by 60, we get:

$$x = \frac{2.2}{4} = 0.55$$

Therefore, Jennifer uses $0.55$ cups of Super Grain cereal.

Answer: $\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 1:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. Then, the calories in the mixture can be represented as $$240x+210\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)=270$$ Simplifying this expression, we get $$x=\frac{1}{3}$$ Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{3}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{3}=\frac{5}{12}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

Answer: Answer(C)
Response 2:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 

The amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{1}{4} - x$. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from the two cereals: 

\begin{align*}
240x + 210\left(\frac{3}{4} - x\right) &= 270 \\
240x + 157.5 - 210x &= 270 \\
30x &= 112.5 \\
x &= \frac{112.5}{30} = \frac{15}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \operatorname{cup}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 3:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal and $(1-x)$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal.
Then the total number of calories in the mixture is:
$240x+210(1-x)=270$
Solving for $x$, we get:
$x=\frac{3}{16}$
Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{3}{16}$ cups of Super Grain cereal and $\frac{13}{16}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal.
To find out how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture, we need to divide the amount of Super Grain cereal by the total amount of mixture in one cup:
$\frac{\frac{3}{16}}{\frac{3}{16}+\frac{13}{16}}=\frac{3}{16}\times\frac{16}{16}=\frac{3}{16}$
So, the answer is $\frac{3}{16}$ cup.
Answer: $\textbf{(A) }\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 4:
Let $x$ be the number of cups of Super Grain cereal Jennifer mixes with Crunchy Grain cereal. The total number of calories in the mixture is the sum of the calories from the Crunchy Grain cereal and the calories from the Super Grain cereal, which is $210 + 240x$. We need to solve the equation $210 + 240x = 270$ to find $x$. Subtracting 210 from both sides gives $240x = 60$, and dividing both sides by 240 gives $x = \frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{1}{4}\text{ cup}}$ of Super Grain cereal with Crunchy Grain cereal.
Response 5:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 
The amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x$. 
The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from the Crunchy Grain cereal and the calories from the Super Grain cereal. We can write an equation based on this information, as follows: 

\begin{align*}
210\left(\frac{1-x}{3/4}\right) + 240x &= 270 \\
140(1-x) + 320x &= 270 \cdot \frac{3}{4} \\
320x - 140x &= 60 \\
180x &= 60 \\
x &= \frac{1}{3}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 6:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $y$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

From the nutrition facts on the box, we know that one serving size of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, which is also equal to $\frac{1}{4}$ of a cup. So, if Jennifer mixes $y$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal, then she uses $4y$ servings of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

Each serving of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories and 50 of which are calories from fat. Therefore, one serving of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 160 calories that are not from fat. So, $4y$ servings of Crunchy Grain cereal provide $160 \cdot 4y = 640y$ calories that are not from fat.

We also know that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal, which provides 240 calories per cup. So, $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal provide $240x$ calories.

The total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270. Therefore, we can write an equation:

$$
240x+160\cdot 4y=270(x+y)
$$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$$
240x+640y=270x+270y
$$

$$
70x=370y
$$

$$
x=\frac{37}{7}y
$$

Since we want to find how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture, we need to find the ratio of Super Grain cereal to the total mixture. One cup of the mixture contains $x+y$ cups of cereal. We know that $x=\frac{37}{7}y$, so we can write:

$$
x+y=\frac{44}{7}y
$$

Therefore, the ratio of Super Grain cereal to the total mixture is:

$$
\frac{x}{x+y}=\frac{\frac{37}{7}y}{\frac{44}{7}y}=\frac{37}{44}
$$

Finally, we can find how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture by multiplying the ratio by one cup:

$$
\frac{37}{44}\cdot 1 = \frac{37}{44}
$$

So, Jennifer mixes $\frac{37}{44}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{7}{44}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal to make one cup of the mixture.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C") $\frac{1}{3}$ cup.
Response 7:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. Thus, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x$. We can set up the equation as follows: 

\begin{align*}
240x + 210(1-x) &= 270 \\
240x + 210 - 210x &= 270 \\
30x &= 60 \\
x &= 2 \\
\end{align*}

Therefore, Jennifer uses $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}}$ of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture.
Response 8:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. Therefore, the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is:
\begin{align*}
240x + 210\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right) &= 270 \\
240x + 157.5 - 210x &= 270 \\
30x &= 112.5 \\
x &= 3.75
\end{align*}
Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\boxed{\textbf{(A)} \frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}}$ of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{8}=\frac{5}{8}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal.
Response 9:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal and $(1-x)$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. We can set up the equation as follows:
\begin{align*}
240x + 210\left(1-x\right) &= 270 \\
30x &= 60 \\
x &= 2/3
\end{align*}
So, Jennifer uses $\frac{2}{3}$ cups of Super Grain cereal and $\frac{1}{3}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal, which means the answer is $\frac{2}{3} - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{12} = \frac{0.0833}{1}$ cup of Super Grain cereal.

We can solve for $v$ by rearranging the given equation as follows: $$h-k=-16t^2+vt$$
Adding $16t^2$ to both sides gives: $$vt=h-k+16t^2$$
Dividing by $t$ on both sides gives: $$v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16t$$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
We can start by rearranging the given equation to solve for $v$:
$$h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$$
$$h-k=-16 t^{2}+v t$$
$$v t=-16 t^{2}+h-k$$
$$v=\frac{-16 t^{2}+h-k}{t}$$
$$v=-16 t+\frac{h-k}{t}$$
Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
We can solve this equation for $v$ by taking the derivative of $h$ with respect to $t$. 

$$h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$$
$$\frac{dh}{dt}=-32 t + v$$
$$v=32t+\frac{dh}{dt}$$

Response 9:
To solve for $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$, we need to isolate the variable $v$ in the given equation. We can do this by rearranging the terms as follows:
$$h=k+v t-16 t^{2}$$
Adding $16 t^{2}$ to both sides, we get:
$$h+16 t^{2}=k+v t$$
Subtracting $k$ from both sides, we get:
$$h-k+16 t^{2}=v t$$
Finally, dividing both sides by $t$, we get:
$$v=\frac{h-k+16 t^{2}}{t}$$
Therefore, the answer is (B) $v=\frac{h-k+16}{t}$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
To find the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line, we need to take the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. 

Action: Answer("C") 

The given line has a slope of $\frac{2}{3}$. The line perpendicular to it will have a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$. The equation $2x+4y=6$ can be rewritten as $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$, which has a slope of $-\frac{1}{2}$, the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. Therefore, the graph of $2x+4y=6$ is perpendicular to the graph of $-2x+3y=6$.
Response 4:
To find the equation of a line perpendicular to the given equation, we need to take the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given equation. The given equation can be rewritten as $y = \frac{2}{3}x + 2$. The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$. The negative reciprocal of this slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To find the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line, we need to take the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. 

The given line is $-2x+3y=6$, or $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$.

The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$.

Now we need to find an equation with slope $-\frac{3}{2}$. The only equation with this slope is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 3x+4y=6}$.
Response 8:
To find the line that is perpendicular to the given line, we need to find the slope of the given line and then take the negative reciprocal of it. The given line can be written in slope-intercept form as $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$. The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, the slope of the line perpendicular to the given line is $-\frac{3}{2}$.

Now we need to find the equation of the line with slope $-\frac{3}{2}$ that passes through the origin (since the line must go through the point $(0,0)$ in order to be perpendicular to the given line). This line can be written in slope-intercept form as $y=-\frac{3}{2}x$. 

So the question is asking us to identify the equation whose graph has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$. The equation $2x+4y=6$ can be written in slope-intercept form as $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$, so this equation has a slope of $-\frac{1}{2}$, which is not equal to $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

The only equation that remains is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 2x+6y=3}$.

Response 7:
Action: Answer("A") 

We can solve the system of equations using elimination method as follows:
\begin{align*}
kx-3y&=4 \\
4x-5y&=7 \\
\end{align*}

Multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by $-k$, we get:

\begin{align*}
4kx-12y&=16 \\
-4kx+5ky&=-7k \\
\end{align*}

Adding the two equations, we get: 
\begin{align*}
-7y&=16-7k \\
y&=\frac{7k-16}{7} \\
\end{align*}

Substituting $y$ in terms of $k$ back into the first equation, we get: 
\begin{align*}
kx-3\left(\frac{7k-16}{7}\right)&=4 \\
7kx-21(7k-16)&=4\cdot7 \\
7kx-147k+336&=28 \\
7kx&=175k-308 \\
x&=\frac{25}{7}-\frac{4}{7k} \\
\end{align*}

So, the system has no solution if and only if $\frac{25}{7}-\frac{4}{7k}$ is not a real number, which happens if and only if $k=\frac{12}{5}$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{12}{5}}$.

Question: If $\frac{2 a}{b}=\frac{1}{2}$, what is the value of $\frac{b}{a} ?$
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4}$
  C: 2
  D: 4
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Solution:
We begin by cross multiplying the given equation to get rid of the fraction: $$
\begin{aligned}
2 a &=\frac{b}{2} \\
2 a &=\frac{1}{2} b \\
4 a &=b
\end{aligned}
$$ We can substitute $4a$ for $b$ in the initial equation to get: $$
\frac{2 a}{4 a}=\frac{1}{2}
$$ which simplifies to $\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, we know that $\frac{b}{a} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }2}$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Multiplying both sides of the equation $\frac{2a}{b}=\frac{1}{2}$ by $\frac{b}{2}$ gives $a = \frac{b}{4}$. Dividing both sides by $a$ gives $\frac{b}{a} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }4}$. 

Therefore, the answer is (D) 4.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
We can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by $\frac{b}{2}$ to isolate $\frac{b}{a}$:
\begin{align*}
\frac{2a}{b} &= \frac{1}{2}\\
\frac{2a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{2} &= \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{b}{2}\\
\frac{a}{1} &= \frac{b}{4}\\
\frac{b}{a} &= \frac{4}{1}\\
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }4}$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")  
Solution: We can start by cross-multiplying to get rid of the fractions: $$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{2 a}{b} &=\frac{1}{2} \\
2 a &=\frac{b}{2} \\
2 a &=\frac{1}{2} b \\
4 a &=b
\end{aligned}
$$
So $\frac{b}{a}=\frac{4 a}{a}=4$.
Response 9:
Solution: 

We begin by cross multiplying the given equation to get $4a=b$. Dividing both sides by $a$ gives us $\frac{b}{a}=4$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 4}$.

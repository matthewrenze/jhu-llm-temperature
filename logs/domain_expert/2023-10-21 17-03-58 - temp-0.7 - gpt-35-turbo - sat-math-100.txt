Topic: Math
Question: A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 10,800$
  B: $\$ 16,200$
  C: $\$ 21,600$
  D: $\$ 29,700$
Response 0:
Solution: Since the equipment depreciates at a constant rate, the depreciation per year is $\frac{\$ 32,400}{12}= \$ 2,700$. Therefore, after 4 years, the equipment will have depreciated by $4 \cdot \$ 2,700 = \$ 10,800$. The current value of the equipment will be the original cost minus the depreciation after 4 years, which is $\$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 = \$ 21,600$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Solution: 
The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years. Therefore, the equipment depreciates $\frac{\$32,400}{12}= \$2700$ per year. After 4 years, the equipment would have depreciated $4 \times \$2700 = \$10,800$. 

Therefore, the equipment is worth $\$32,400 - \$10,800 = \$21,600$ after 4 years.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
We can solve this problem using linear depreciation. If the equipment depreciates at a constant rate over 12 years, then its value decreases by $\frac{32400}{12} = 2700$ dollars per year. 

After 4 years, the equipment would have depreciated by $4 \times 2700 = 10800$ dollars. Therefore, the equipment would be worth $32400 - 10800 = 21600$ dollars.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B") 

Solution: 

Since the equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate, we can model its value $V$ (in dollars) after $t$ years as a linear function: 

$$V(t) = mt + b$$

where $m$ is the slope (rate of depreciation) and $b$ is the initial value of the equipment. 

We know that $V(0) = 32,400$, so $b = 32,400$. We also know that after 12 years, the equipment has no value, i.e. $V(12) = 0$. Using these two points, we can solve for $m$: 

$$0 = m(12) + 32,400 \Rightarrow m = -2,700$$

So the equation for $V(t)$ is: 

$$V(t) = -2,700t + 32,400$$

To find the value of the equipment 4 years after it is purchased, we can plug in $t=4$: 

$$V(4) = -2,700(4) + 32,400 = 16,200$$

Therefore, the camera equipment is worth $\$ 16,200$ 4 years after it is purchased.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
The equipment depreciates at a constant rate for 12 years, so each year it will lose the same amount of value. After 12 years, it will be worth 0. Therefore, the amount of value lost per year is:

$$\frac{\$ 32,400}{12 \text{ years}} = \$ 2,700 \text{ per year}$$

After 4 years, the value lost will be:

$$4 \text{ years} \times \$ 2,700 \text{ per year} = \$ 10,800$$

The current value of the equipment will be the original value minus the value lost, so:

$$\$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 = \$ 21,600$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$ 21,600$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Solution: 

The camera equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, so it depreciates $\frac{1}{12}$ of its value each year.

After 4 years, the camera equipment will have depreciated by $\frac{1}{12} \cdot 4 = \frac{1}{3}$ of its original value.

The current value of the camera equipment is:

$32400 - \frac{1}{3} \cdot 32400 = 32400 - 10800 = 21600$

Therefore, the camera equipment is worth $\$ 21,600$ after 4 years.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cylindrical can containing pieces of fruit is filled to the top with syrup before being sealed. The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. If $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, which of the following is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can?
Choices:
  A: $7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  B: $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  C: $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  D: $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 0:
Here, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to find the volume of the can. We can then subtract the volume of the syrup to find the volume of the fruit. 

$V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h$

We are given that the base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}}$. Substituting this and the given height of 10 cm into the formula, we get:

$V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi \left(\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}}\right)^2 \cdot 10 = 750\pi \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

We are given that it takes $110\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup to fill the can to the top. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is:

$V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} - V_{\text{syrup}} = 750\pi - 110 \approx 185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

So, the closest answer choice is (B) $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let the radius of the cylinder be $r$. From the given information, we know that the volume of the cylinder is $\pi r^2 \cdot 10 = 10\pi r^2$ and the volume of the syrup is $110 \text{ cm}^3$. Since the syrup fills the entire volume not occupied by the fruit, the volume of the fruit is $10\pi r^2 - 110$. We want to find the volume of the fruit, so we need to find $r$. The area of the base of the cylinder is $\pi r^2 = 75$, so $r^2 = \frac{75}{\pi}$ and $r = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}}$. Then the volume of the fruit is $10\pi r^2 - 110 = 750 - 110 = 640$. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let the radius of the base be $r$ and let the volume of fruit in the can be $V$. Then, the volume of syrup in the can is given by $\pi r^2 h$. We can set up the following equation: 

$$\pi r^2 h = 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

We can also use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to set up an equation for $V$: 

$$V = \pi r^2 h \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = \frac{220}{3} \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

Therefore, the answer is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the volume of the can using the given information: 

$V_{can} = A_{base} \times h = 75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \times 10 \mathrm{~cm} = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Since the can is filled to the top with syrup, the total volume of the contents (fruit + syrup) is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. We can find the volume of the fruit by subtracting the volume of the syrup from the total volume: 

$V_{fruit} = V_{total} - V_{syrup} = 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = -640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

The result is negative, which doesn't make sense for a volume. This means that there might be an error in the problem or in the answer choices. None of the answer choices are correct, so we would select the answer that is closest to a reasonable result, which is Choice C: $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
Response 4:
Let the radius of the cylindrical can be $r$.
The volume of the can is given by $\pi r^2 h$.
The volume of the syrup is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
We can use this to find the area of the top surface of the fruit, which is the same as the area of the base minus the area of the syrup.
Area of the top surface = Area of base - Volume of syrup/height = $75 - 110/10 = 64.0 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.
The height of the fruit in the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$.
So, the volume of the fruit in the can is given by $\pi r^2 h_{\text{fruit}}$, where $h_{\text{fruit}}$ is the height of the fruit.
The volume of the fruit in the can is $V_{\text{can}} - V_{\text{syrup}} = 750 - 110 = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
We can now find the volume of the fruit using $V_{\text{fruit}} = A_{\text{top}}h_{\text{fruit}} = 64.0h_{\text{fruit}}$.
$V_{\text{fruit}} = \pi r^2 h_{\text{fruit}} = \pi \cdot (\frac{75}{\pi})^2 h_{\text{fruit}} = 5625h_{\text{fruit}}/\pi$.
$V_{\text{fruit}} = 64.0h_{\text{fruit}} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
Hence, $h_{\text{fruit}} = 640/(64.0) = 10$, and $V_{\text{fruit}} = \pi r^2 h_{\text{fruit}} = \pi \cdot (\frac{75}{\pi})^2 \cdot 10 \approx 1767.1 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
Therefore, the closest volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}~185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 5:
Let the radius of the can be $r$ and let the volume of the fruit be $V$. Since the can is filled to the top with syrup, the total volume of the fruit and syrup is the volume of the can, which is $\pi r^2h = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. We also know that the volume of the syrup is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, so the volume of the fruit is $V = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is $\pi r^2h$, and we know that the base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and the height is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, so we can solve for $r$ as follows: 

$\pi r^2 = 75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \Rightarrow r^2 = \frac{75}{\pi} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \Rightarrow r \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$ 

Therefore, the volume of the fruit is approximately: 

$V \approx \pi r^2 h - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ 

So the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\mathrm{(B)~}185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 6:
Let the radius of the cylindrical can be denoted by $r$. The volume of the syrup and the volume of the fruit in the can are equal. We know that the volume of the syrup is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore,
$$\pi r^{2} \cdot 10 = 110 \implies r^{2} = \frac{11}{\pi}$$
We are asked to find the volume of the fruit in the can, which is the difference between the volume of the can and the volume of the syrup. The volume of the can is
$$\pi r^{2} \cdot 10 = 10 \cdot \frac{11}{\pi} = \frac{110}{\pi}$$
The volume of the fruit in the can is
$$\frac{110}{\pi} - 110 = 110 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\pi} - 1\right) \approx \boxed{\textbf{(C) }640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$$
Response 7:
We can start by finding the volume of the can using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V_{\text{can}} = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, the radius of the base is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $V_{\text{can}} = \pi (4.33)^2 (10) \approx 592.73 \mathrm{~cm}^3$.

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is equal to the total volume of the can minus the volume of the syrup, which is $V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{can}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 482.73 \mathrm{~cm}^3$.

The answer is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 8:
First, let's find the volume of the cylinder using the given information: 

$V_{\text{cylinder}} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 75\text{~cm}^2 \times 10\text{~cm} = 750\text{~cm}^3$

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is used, the volume of the fruit is the difference between the volume of the cylinder and the volume of the syrup:

$V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} - 110\text{~cm}^3 = 750\text{~cm}^3 - 110\text{~cm}^3 = 640\text{~cm}^3$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
Response 9:
Let's start by finding the volume of the can. We know that the area of the base is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and the height is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, so the volume is:

$V_{can} = \mathrm{Area~of~base} \times \mathrm{height} = 75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \times 10 \mathrm{~cm} = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

We also know that the can is filled to the top with syrup, so the volume of the syrup is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Let's subtract this from the total volume of the can to find the volume of the fruit:

$V_{fruit} = V_{can} - V_{syrup} = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Therefore, the closest answer is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Response 0:
Given that $y=kx$, and $y=24$ when $x=6$. We can find the value of $k$ as follows:

$k=\frac{y}{x}=\frac{24}{6}=4$

Therefore, $y=kx=4x$.

When $x=5$, then $y=4x=4 \times 5=20$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
We can use the information given to solve for $k$ first:
$y=kx \rightarrow 24=k(6) \rightarrow k=4$
Now that we know $k=4$, we can solve for $y$ when $x=5$:
$y=kx \rightarrow y=4(5)=20$
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
To find the value of $y$, we need to solve for $k$ first. Substituting the given values, we get:

$24 = k \times 6$

$k = 4$

Now that we know the value of $k$, we can substitute it back into the original equation and solve for $y$ when $x=5$:

$y = 4x$

$y = 4 \times 5$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
We can solve this problem by using the given equation $y=kx$ and the information provided that $y=24$ when $x=6$. 

First, we can find the value of $k$ by substituting $x=6$ and $y=24$ into the equation:
$$y=kx \quad \Rightarrow \quad 24=k \cdot 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k=4$$

Now that we know $k=4$, we can use the equation to find $y$ when $x=5$:
$$y=kx \quad \Rightarrow \quad y=4 \cdot 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y=20$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. 

Action: Answer("C")

$$ y=kx \Rightarrow y=4\cdot5=20 $$
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
We know that $y=kx$ and $y=24$ when $x=6$. Therefore, $24=k(6)$. Solving for $k$, we get $k=4$. We need to find the value of $y$ when $x=5$. Substituting the values of $k$ and $x$, we get $y=4(5)=20$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
We can start by finding the value of $k$ using the information given. We know that when $x=6$, $y=24$, so:

$24=k\cdot 6$

Solving for $k$:

$k=4$

Now that we have the value of $k$, we can use the equation $y=kx$ to find the value of $y$ when $x=5$:

$y=4\cdot 5 = 20$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
We can use the given equation $y=kx$ and the given point $(x,y)=(6, 24)$ to solve for the constant $k$. Substituting these values, we get $24=k\cdot6$, which simplifies to $k=4$.

Now that we know $k=4$, we can use the equation $y=4x$ to find the value of $y$ when $x=5$:
$$y=4x=4\cdot5=20$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We can use the given equation $y=kx$ and substitute the given values of $x$ and $y$ to find the value of $k$. Then we can use the value of $k$ to find the value of $y$ when $x=5$.

Given, $y=kx$, $y=24$ when $x=6$. 

So, $24=k(6)$ or $k=4$.

Now, we can use $k=4$ and $x=5$ to find $y$.

$$y=kx=4(5)=20$$

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If $2 w+4 t=14$ and $4 w+5 t=25$, what is the value of $2 w+3 t ?$
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 10
  C: 13
  D: 17
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")  

Solution: 

We are given two equations, 

$2 w+4 t=14$ ...(1)

$4 w+5 t=25$ ...(2)

Multiplying equation 1 with 2, we get,

$4 w+8 t=28$ 

Subtracting equation 2 from this, we get, 

$3t = 3$

$t=1$

Substituting $t=1$ in equation 1, we get, 

$2w+4=14$

$2w=10$

$w=5$

Thus, 

$2w+3t = 2(5)+3(1) = 13$ 

Hence, the answer is 13.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve for $w$ and $t$ by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation. This gives $-7t=-11$, so $t=\frac{11}{7}$. Substituting this value of $t$ into the first equation gives $w=\frac{3}{7}$. Finally, we can compute $2w+3t=\frac{6}{7}+\frac{33}{7}=\frac{39}{7}=5\frac{4}{7}$. The closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 13}$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve for $w$ and $t$ by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation to get $t=3$ and then substituting this value of $t$ into the first equation to get $w=2$. Thus, $2w+3t=2(2)+3(3)=13$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ to get $-4w-8t=-28$ and then adding it to the second equation to get $4w+5t-4w-8t=25-28$, which simplifies to $-3t=-3$. Thus, $t=1$. Substituting this value into the first equation gives $2w+4=14$, so $2w=10$ and $w=5$. Therefore, $2w+3t=2(5)+3(1)=13$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation. This eliminates the $2w$ term, giving us $-7t=-3,$ or $t=\frac{3}{7}.$ Plugging that into the first equation gives us $2w+4(\frac{3}{7})=14,$ which simplifies to $2w=\frac{50}{7}.$ Dividing both sides by $2$ gives $w=\frac{25}{7}.$ Finally, $2w+3t=2(\frac{25}{7})+3(\frac{3}{7})=\frac{71}{7}=13.$
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")  

Solution: 

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation, which eliminates $w$ and gives us an equation in terms of $t:$

\begin{align*}
(4w+5t)-2(2w+4t)&=25-2\cdot14\\
\Rightarrow \qquad 0w-t &= -3\\
\Rightarrow \qquad t &= 3.
\end{align*}

Substituting $t=3$ into the first equation yields $2w+4(3)=14,$ so $w=2.$ Therefore, $2w+3t=2(2)+3(3)=13.$
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve the problem, we need to eliminate either $w$ or $t$ from the two equations. We can do that by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and the second equation by $3$ and adding them up. This gives us $-2(2w+4t)+3(4w+5t)=-8w-8t+12w+15t=7t+4w=47$. Therefore, $2w+3t=\frac{47}{7}=6\frac{5}{7} \approx 13$. Answer is (C).
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve the given equations using elimination method. Multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation, we get $t=3$. Substituting $t=3$ in the first equation, we get $w=2$. Hence, $2w+3t=2(2)+3(3)=4+9=\boxed{13}$.
Response 8:
Solution:
We can solve this problem by either substitution or elimination method. Here we will solve it by elimination method.
Multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding with second equation, we get
\begin{align*} &-4w-8t+4w+5t=-28+25 \\ \Rightarrow&-3t=-3 \\ \Rightarrow & t=1 \end{align*}
Now, substituting $t=1$ in any of the equation, we get $2w=6$. Hence, $w=3$.
So, $2w+3t=2(3)+3(1)=9$.

Answer: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B") 

To solve the system of equations, we can multiply the first equation by $-2$ and add it to the second equation. This will eliminate $w$ and give us $t=2.$ 
Substituting $t=2$ into the first equation gives $w=3.$ 
Therefore, $2w+3t=2(3)+3(2)=6+6=\boxed{12}.$

Question: $$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$The equation above is true for all $x$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. What is the value of $a b$ ?
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 24
  D: 40
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can start by expanding the left hand side and equating it to the right hand side: 
$$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$
$$5 a x^{3}+15 x^{2}+20 a x^{2}+12 a x-4 b x^{2}-12 x+16 b x+12=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$
Simplifying the above expression and comparing the coefficients of like terms, we get:
$$5 a=20\Rightarrow a=4$$
$$-4b=16\Rightarrow b=-4$$
Therefore, $ab=4\times(-4)=-16$, which is not one of the answer choices. However, since "none of the above" is not an option, we select the closest answer, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 24}$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can begin solving the problem by expanding the left-hand side of the equation: 

$$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=5ax^3- abx^2+20x^2+12ax-3bx+12$$

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

$$20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12=20x^3+(-9-20)x^2+(-2+12a-3b)x+12$$

Since the equation is true for all $x$, we can equate the coefficients of the powers of $x$ on both sides of the equation. 

Comparing the coefficient of $x^2$, we get: 

$$5a - ab = -29$$

Comparing the coefficient of $x$, we get:

$$12a-3b=-2$$

Solving for $a$ and $b$, we get:

$$a = \frac{29}{5b-5}$$

$$b = \frac{12a+2}{3}$$

Substituting the expression for $a$ in terms of $b$ into the second equation, we get:

$$12\left(\frac{29}{5b-5}\right)+2=3b$$

Simplifying and solving for $b$, we get:

$$b=4,2$$

Substituting each value of $b$ into the expression for $a$ in terms of $b$, we get:

$$a=\frac{29}{5b-5}=\frac{29}{15}, -29$$

Since $a$ cannot be negative, the only valid value of $b$ is $b=4$, which gives $a=24/10=12/5$. Therefore, $ab=12$. 

Hence, the answer is (C) 24.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
We can expand the left-hand side of the equation to obtain: $$5a x^3 - ab x^2 + (20a + 12)x^2 + (-3ab - 40)x + 12a = 20x^3 - 9x^2 - 2x + 12$$We can equate coefficients of $x^3$, $x^2$, $x$ and constant terms on both sides of the equation to obtain: 
\begin{align*}
5a &= 20\\
ab &= -12\\
20a + 12 &= -9\\
-3ab - 40 &= -2\\
12a &= 12
\end{align*}
From the first equation, we get $a=4$. Substituting this value in the third equation we get $b=-1/4$. Thus, $a b = 4 \cdot (-1/4) = -1$.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Note: None of the above choices is correct.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B") 

Expanding the left side of the equation, we get:

$$5a x^3 + (12-5ab) x^2 + (12-4ab) x + 12a = 20 x^3 - 9 x^2 - 2 x + 12$$

By comparing the coefficients of each degree of $x$, we get the following system of equations:

$$\begin{cases}5a=20\\12-5ab=-9\\12-4ab=-2\\12a=12\end{cases}$$

Solving this system of equations, we get $a=4$ and $b=-\frac{4}{5}$, so $ab=-\frac{16}{5}$, which is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }20}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")  

We can start the problem by multiplying the terms on the left-hand side of the equation:
$$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$
$$5ax^3 - abx^2 + 15x^2 - 3bx + 20x + 12 = 20x^3 - 9x^2 - 2x + 12$$
$$15ax^3 - abx^2 + 18x^2 - 3bx = 0$$
We know that this equation is true for all $x$, so all coefficients must be equal to 0. Therefore, we get the following system of equations:
\begin{align*}
15a &= 0\\
-ab + 18 &= 0\\
-3b &= 0
\end{align*}
Solving this system, we get $a=0$ and $b=0$ or $a=0$ and $b=18/(-1)=-18$. Therefore, $ab=0\times0=0$ or $ab=0\times(-18)=0$. Since none of the choices is "None of the above", we select the most likely answer, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 20}$.

Question: If $a^{2}+b^{2}=z$ and $a b=y$, which of the following is equivalent to $4 z+8 y$ ?
Choices:
  A: $(a+2 b)^{2}$
  B: $(2 a+2 b)^{2}$
  C: $(4 a+4 b)^{2}$
  D: $(4 a+8 b)^{2}$
Response 0:
We can simplify $4z+8y$ by substituting the value of $z$ from the first equation:
$$4z+8y=4(a^2+b^2)+8y=4a^2+4b^2+8y$$
We can then substitute the value of $b^2$ in terms of $a$ and $y$:
$$4a^2+4b^2+8y=4a^2+4(\frac{y^2}{a^2})+8y=4a^2+\frac{4y^2}{a^2}+8y$$
Now we can factor out a 4 and write the expression in terms of $(a+2b)^2$:
$$4a^2+\frac{4y^2}{a^2}+8y=4\left(a^2+2ab+b^2\right)=4(a+b)^2=(a+2b)^2$$
Therefore, the answer is (A) $(a+2b)^2$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
We can simplify $4 z+8 y$ as $4(a^2+b^2)+8(ab)$. Distributing the 4, we get $4a^2+4b^2+8ab$. Now, using the formula $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$, we can re-write $4a^2+4b^2+8ab$ as $4(a^2+2ab+b^2)$. Substituting $z$ for $a^2+b^2$, we get $4z$ and we can substitute $(a+b)^2$ for $a^2+2ab+b^2$ to get $(a+b)^2$.

Therefore, the answer is:

Response 2:

Response 3:
We can simplify $4z+8y$ by substituting $z=a^{2}+b^{2}$ and $y=ab$. Then we get:

$4z+8y = 4(a^{2}+b^{2})+8(ab) = 4a^{2}+4b^{2}+8ab$

Now, notice that $4a^{2}+4b^{2}+8ab = 4(a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}) = 4(a+b)^{2}$. Therefore, we have:

$4z+8y = 4(a+b)^{2}$

So the answer is (B) $(2a+2b)^{2}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
We can simplify $4z + 8y$ as $4(a^2 + b^2) + 8(ab)$. Substituting $z$ and $y$ in terms of $a$ and $b$ we get, $4z + 8y = 4(a^2 + b^2) + 8(ab) = 4a^2 + 4b^2 + 4ab + 4ab = 4(a+b)^2$. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
We can simplify $4z+8y$ by substituting $z=a^2+b^2$ and $y=ab$ to get $4z+8y = 4(a^2+b^2) + 8(ab) = 4a^2+8ab+4b^2 = 4(a^2+2ab+b^2) = 4(a+b)^2$. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
We can start by factoring out $4$ from the given expression: $4z+8y = 4(z+2y)$. 

Now, we can use the given equations to substitute for $z$ and $y$: 

$z = a^2 + b^2$ 

$y = ab$ 

So, $4(z+2y) = 4(a^2 + b^2 + 2ab)$. 

Note that $a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = (a+b)^2$. 

Therefore, we have: 

$4(a^2 + b^2 + 2ab) = 4(a+b)^2$

Simplifying further, we get: 

$4(a+b)^2 = (2a + 2b)^2$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
We can see that the two points $(5,16.94)$ and $(10,21.89)$ lie on a line. Therefore, we can find the slope of the line using the two points. 

Slope $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{21.89 - 16.94}{10 - 5} = 0.99$

We know that $f(x)$ is a linear function, so it has the form $f(x) = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. 

We can find $b$ by plugging in one of the points and solving for $b$. Using point $(5, 16.94)$, we have:

$16.94 = 0.99(5) + b \implies b = 11.99$

Therefore, the function is $f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.

Response 7:
The given shipping charges have a linear relationship with merchandise weight. 

We can observe that when the merchandise weight is 0 pounds, the shipping charge is also 0 dollars. This eliminates options (A) and (B).

Let's use two points from the table to find the slope of the line, which represents the rate of change of the shipping charge with respect to the merchandise weight. For example, using (5, 16.94) and (20, 31.79):

slope $m=\dfrac{\text{change in shipping charge}}{\text{change in merchandise weight}}=\dfrac{\$31.79-\$16.94}{20-5}=\dfrac{\$14.85}{15}=0.99$

The y-intercept of the line represents the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0. We know from the table that this value is 0, so the y-intercept is also 0. This eliminates option (C).

Therefore, the equation of the line (or function that represents the shipping charge) is:

$f(x)=mx+b=0.99x+0=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ f(x)=3.39 x+16.94}$

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $a$ & $3 a$ & $5 a$ \\\hline$y$ & 0 & $-a$ & $-2 a$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$ are shown in the table above, where $a$ is a constant. If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $x+2 y=a$
  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
Response 0:
To have a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ we look for a relationship that can be written in the form $y=mx+b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. We can find the slope of the line from the table by looking at how much $y$ changes for every $x$ change. The slope of the line is the same between any two points on the line, so we can choose any two points. We will use the first and second rows: $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-1$. Thus, the equation $y=mx+b$ can be written as $y=-x+b$ for some $b$. We can find $b$ by plugging in one of the points: $0=-1\cdot0+b$ so $b=0$. Thus, the equation is $y=-x$, or $x+y=0$. We can rewrite this as $x+2y=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }a}$.
Response 1:
We can set up a system of equations to represent the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ using the values given in the table:
\begin{align*}
a+0b&=a\\
3a+(-a)b&=0\\
5a+(-2a)b&=0
\end{align*}
Simplifying each equation gives:
\begin{align*}
a&=a\\
2a&=b\\
5a&=2b
\end{align*}
We can now substitute $2a$ for $b$ in the third equation to get $5a=4a$, which is not true for all values of $a$. Therefore, there is no linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, and the answer is $\boxed{\text{None of the Above}}$.
Response 2:
Multiplying the second column by $2$ and subtracting the third column from the result gives $2a-3a=-a$ for the second and third rows, respectively. This matches the second column, so the relationship is linear. To find the slope, note that moving from $x=a$ to $x=5a$ corresponds to moving from $y=-a$ to $y=-2a$, which is a change of $y$ of $-a$, and a change of $x$ of $4a$. Therefore, the slope is $-\frac{a}{4a}=-\frac{1}{4}$. This means that the equation of the line is of the form $x+2y=k$ for some constant $k$. Plugging in $(x,y)=(a,0)$ gives $a+2\cdot 0=k$, so $k=a$. Therefore, the equation is $x+2y=\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ a}$.
Response 3:
To determine which equation represents the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we need to find the slope and the y-intercept of the line that passes through $(a,0)$, $(3a,-a)$, and $(5a,-2a)$.  

The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by: 

$$\text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

Using this formula, we can find the slope of the line passing through $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$: 

$$\text{slope} = \frac{-a - 0}{3a - a} = -\frac{1}{2}$$

We can also find the slope of the line passing through $(3a,-a)$ and $(5a,-2a)$: 

$$\text{slope} = \frac{-2a - (-a)}{5a - 3a} = -\frac{1}{2}$$

Since the slopes are the same, we know that the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is linear. 

To find the y-intercept, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation: 

$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$

where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1,y_1)$ is any point on the line. We can use $(a,0)$ as our point: 

$$y - 0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - a)$$

Simplifying, we get: 

$$y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}a$$

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 

$$2y = -x + a$$

Adding $x$ to both sides, we get: 

$$x + 2y = a$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ x+2y=a}$.
Response 4:
Substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ into the equation $ax+b=y$, we have the equations $a(0)+b=0$, $a(a)+b=-a$, and $a(3a)+b=-2a$. Solving these equations for $a$ and $b$, we find that $a=-\frac{1}{a}$ and $b=a^2$. Thus, the equation of the line is $ax+a^2=y$, which can be rewritten as $x+(a)y=a^2$. Dividing by $a$ gives $x + \frac{1}{a}y = a$, or $x + 2y = 2a$.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
We can start by finding the slope of the line that passes through the points $(a,0)$ and $(5a,-2a)$. The slope is given by $$m=\frac{-2a-0}{5a-a}=-\frac{2}{4}=-\frac{1}{2}.$$ Next, we can use the point-slope form of a line to get the equation of the line passing through $(a,0)$: $$y-0=-\frac{1}{2}(x-a)\Rightarrow y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}a.$$ Rearranging this equation gives us $x+2y=a$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.
Response 6:
We can start by looking at the slopes of the lines connecting the given points. The slope between $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$ is $\frac{-a-0}{3a-a} = -\frac{a}{2a} = -\frac{1}{2}$. The slope between $(a,0)$ and $(5a,-2a)$ is $\frac{-2a-0}{5a-a} = -\frac{2a}{4a} = -\frac{1}{2}$. Since the slopes are equal, we know that the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is linear. To find the equation of the line, we can use the point-slope formula with the point $(a,0)$ and the slope $-\frac{1}{2}$: $y-0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x-a)$. Simplifying, we get $2y=-x+a$, which is equivalent to $x+2y=a$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } x+2y=a}$.
Response 7:
Substituting the different values of $x$ and $y$ in the table into the different answer choices, we can see that only choice $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ x+2 y=5 a}$ is true for all of them.
Response 8:
We want to find an equation in the form of $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. We can find the slope of the line passing through the points $(a,0)$, $(3a,-a)$, and $(5a,-2a)$ by choosing any two points and finding the slope of the line passing through them. Let's use the first and last points: $$m = \frac{-2a-0}{5a-a} = -\frac{2}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}.$$ Now we use the point-slope form of a line: $$y-0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x-a).$$ Simplifying gives $-2y = x-a$, so $x+2y = a$, which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.
Response 9:
We can see that the slope of the line is $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-1.$ Since the line passes through the point $(3a,-a)$, its equation is $y-(-a)=-1(x-3a)$ or $y=-x+4a$. Solving for $2x-y$, we get $2x-y=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 7a}$.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
Response 0:
We know that 1 decagram = 10 grams and 1 gram = 1000 milligrams. So, 1 decagram = 10 * 1000 = 10,000 milligrams.

Therefore, 2-decagram container = 2 * 10,000 = 20,000 milligrams.

Since each dose is 1 milligram, the number of 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container is:
$$\frac{20,000\text{ milligrams}}{1\text{ milligram}}=20,000$$

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 1:
One 2-decagram container contains $2 \cdot 10=20$ grams of medicine. Since there are $1,000$ milligrams in a gram, there are $20,000$ milligrams in $20$ grams. Therefore, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 20,000}$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.
Response 2:
$1$ decagram $= 10$ grams $= 10,000$ milligrams. Therefore, $2$ decagrams $= 20,000$ milligrams. Since there are $20,000$ milligrams in one 2-decagram container, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 20,000}$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
$2$ decagrams $=$ $2 \times 10$ grams $=$ $20$ grams. 

$1$ gram $=$ $1,000$ milligrams. 

Therefore, $20$ grams $=$ $20,000$ milligrams. 

Thus, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 2,\!000}$ $1$-milligram doses in one $2$-decagram container.
Response 4:
Since, 1 decagram $=10$ grams and 1,000 milligrams $=1$ gram, 1 decagram $=10,000$ milligrams. Therefore, 2 decagrams $=20,000$ milligrams. Since there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2,000}$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
2 decagrams = $2 \times 10$ grams = $20$ grams
Since 1 gram = 1000 milligrams, 20 grams = $20,000$ milligrams
Therefore, there are $20,000$ milligrams in one 2-decagram container.
Since each dose is 1 milligram, there are $\frac{20,000}{1} = 20,000$ doses in one 2-decagram container.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
\begin{aligned}\text {2 decagrams } &=2 \times 10 \text { grams }=20 \text { grams } \\1 \text { gram } &=1,000 \text { milligrams } \\20 \text { grams } &=20,000 \text { milligrams }\end{aligned}
Therefore, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(C)} \: 2,000}$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.
Response 7:
We know that $1$ decagram is equal to $10$ grams. Since there are $1,000$ milligrams in $1$ gram, there are $10\cdot1,000=10,000$ milligrams in $1$ decagram. 

A $2$-decagram container would have twice as much medicine as a $1$-decagram container, so it would have $2\cdot10,000=20,000$ milligrams of medicine.

Therefore, there are $\frac{20,000}{1}=20,\!000$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Since 1 decagram is equal to 10 grams, then 2 decagrams is equal to 20 grams. Since 1,000 milligrams is equal to 1 gram, then we have: $$\begin{aligned} 1\text{ gram} &= 1,000 \text{ milligrams}\\ 20 \text{ grams } &= 20,000 \text{ milligrams}\end{aligned}$$Therefore, there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container. To find how many 1-milligram doses there are, we divide 20,000 milligrams by 1 milligram per dose: $$\begin{aligned} \frac{20,000\text{ milligrams}}{1\text{ milligram/dose}} &= 20,000 \text{ doses} \end{aligned}$$Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
One 2-decagram container is equal to $2 \times 10=20$ grams. 

There are $1,000$ milligrams in one gram, so there are $1,000 \times 20=20,000$ milligrams in $20$ grams. 

Therefore, there are $\frac{20,000}{1}=20,\!000$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")  

Explanation: 
$h(x)=1-g(x)$

$h(0)=1-g(0)=1-(2(0)-1)=1-(-1)=1+1=2$

Therefore, the answer is (C) 1.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")  
$h(x)=1-g(x)=1-[2x-1]=1-2x+1=2-2x.$

So, $h(0)=2-2(0)=2.$
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C") 

We have $h(x)=1-g(x)$, so $h(0)=1-g(0)=1-2(0)-1=0-1=-1$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
$$\begin{aligned} h(x)&=1-g(x) \\&=1-(2x-1) \\&=1-2x+1 \\&=2-2x \end{aligned}$$
So, $h(0)=2-2(0)=2$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C") 

We first evaluate $g(0)$: $$g(0)=2(0)-1=-1$$Since $h(x)=1-g(x)$, we have: $$h(0)=1-g(0)=1-(-1)=1+1=2$$Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(D)}$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")  

To find $h(0)$, we first need to find $g(0)$, which is:
$$g(0)=2(0)-1=-1$$
Then, we can find $h(0)$ by subtracting $g(0)$ from $1$:
$$h(0)=1-g(0)=1-(-1)=1+1=2$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }1}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")  

We have $h(x)=1-g(x)$, so $h(0)=1-g(0)=1-(2\cdot 0-1)=1-(-1)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 1}$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C") 

We have $h(x)=1-g(x)=1-(2x-1)=2(1-x)$. Plugging in $x=0$, we get $h(0)=2(1-0)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2}$.

Among the remaining 150 people, at most 15 people could have chosen the first picture since $0.20(150)=30<36$.
Therefore, the possible values of $p$ satisfy $48<p\leq 150-15=135$.

Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
We can use the fact that the line passes through the origin to set up a system of equations:
\begin{align*}
k &= \frac{32}{k} \cdot k \\
2 &= \frac{32}{k}
\end{align*}
Solving the second equation gives $k=16$. Checking the first equation, we see that $k=16$ satisfies it, so the answer is:

Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
We know that the line passes through the origin. Therefore, both $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ must lie on the line. The slope of the line is given by:
$$\frac{32-k}{k-2}$$
This is because the slope is equal to the change in vertical distance divided by the change in horizontal distance between the two points. However, since the line passes through the origin, we also know that:
$$\frac{32-k}{k-2} = -1$$
This is because the slope of the line passing through the origin is equal to the opposite of the ratio of the $x$-coordinate to the $y$-coordinate of any point on the line. Solving for $k$ gives:
$$32-k = -k+2 \Rightarrow k = 8$$
Therefore, the answer is (C) $8$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We know that the line passes through the origin, which means that $(0, 0)$ satisfies the equation of the line. So we can find the slope of the line from the two given points as follows:

$$\text{slope} = \frac{32-k}{k-2}$$

For the line to pass through the origin, we need the $y$-intercept to be 0, which means the equation of the line can be written as $y = mx$, where $m$ is the slope. Therefore, we need the slope to be:

$$m = \frac{32-k}{k-2} = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{0}{0} = \text{undefined}$$

The only value of $k$ that makes the slope undefined is $k = 2$. Therefore, the answer is:

The median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for all 50 states was $26.95 \%$. What is the difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states?
Choices:
  A: $0.05 \%$
  B: $0.95 \%$
  C: $1.22 \%$
  D: $7.45 \%$
Response 0:
First, we need to arrange the values in ascending order: \begin{align*}
&19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%\\
\end{align*}The median of these 7 values is $27.9\%$, which is one of the values given in the table. Since the median for all 50 states is $26.95 \%$, the difference between the two is $27.9-26.95=0.95\%$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 1:
The median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states is the median of the numbers $19.5, 21.9, 25.9, 27.9, 30.1, 35.5$, and $36.4$. To find the median, we arrange the numbers in order: $$19.5 \quad 21.9 \quad 25.9 \quad 27.9 \quad 30.1 \quad 35.5 \quad 36.4.$$ The median is $27.9 \%$. Therefore, the difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $$\left|26.95-27.9\right|=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}.$$
Response 2:
First, we need to find the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states. Listing the percentages in increasing order we get: $$19.5 \% , 21.9 \%, 25.9 \%, 27.9 \%, 30.1 \%, 35.5 \%, 36.4 \%.$$ The median is $27.9 \%$ since it is the 4th value in the ordered list. The difference between this value and the median for all 50 states, $26.95 \%$, is: $$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%.$$ 
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 3:
The median of the 7 given states can be found by listing them in order: State D, State A, State C, State B, State G, State E, State F. The median is State B with $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
First, we need to write the given data in order from least to greatest: 

$19.5 \%,$ $21.9 \%,$ $25.9 \%,$ $27.9 \%,$ $30.1 \%,$ $35.5 \%,$ $36.4 \%$

The median of these 7 states is $27.9 \%$, which is greater than the median of all 50 states. Therefore, we need to subtract the median of all 50 states from the median of these 7 states: 

$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 5:
First, we need to put the given percentages in order from least to greatest: $19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$. The median of these percentages is $27.9 \%$, which is the median for these 7 states. The difference between this median and the median for all 50 states is $27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$.  

Therefore, the answer is  \boxed{B: 0.95 \%}.
Response 6:
First, we need to order the states by the percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher:
State D, State A, State C, State B, State E, State G, State F.

The median of these seven states is the middle value. Since there are an odd number of values, the median is the fourth value, which is $25.9 \%$.

The difference between the median for these seven states and the median for all 50 states is $26.95 \% - 25.9 \% = 1.05 \%$.

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 1.22 \%}$ (closest to $1.05 \%$)
Response 7:
To find the median, we need to order the percentages in ascending order. 
$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$
The median is $27.9 \%$ since it is the middle value. 
The difference between the median of these 7 states and the median of all 50 states is $26.95\%-27.9\%=-0.95\%$. 
Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$
Response 8:
First, we need to arrange the percent of residents in increasing order. 

$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$

The median is the middle value. In this case, there are 7 values, so the median is the 4th value, which is $27.9 \%$. 

The difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is:

$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$
Response 9:
First, we need to find the median of the 7 states given in the table. Arranging the data in increasing order, we have:

$19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%$

The median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. 

The difference between the median for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is:

$27.9\% - 26.95\% = 0.95\%$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}Year & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Subscriptions } \\ \text { sold }\end{array}$ \\\hline2012 & 5,600 \\2013 & 5,880 \\\end{tabular}\end{center}The manager of an online news service received the report above on the number of subscriptions sold by the service. The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
First, we need to find out how many subscriptions were sold in 2013. Then, we can use the information given to set up an equation to solve for the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. 

To find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: 

$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05$ or 5% 

Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is 2x. 

So we have: 

$1.05 \cdot (1+x) = 1+2x$ 

Simplifying: 

$1.05 + 1.05x = 1+2x$ 

$0.05x = 0.05$ 

$x = 1$ or 100% 

This means that the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is expected to be twice the number sold in 2013. 

Subscriptions sold in 2013: 5,880 

Subscriptions sold in 2014: 2 * 5,880 = 11,760 

Answer: Action: Answer("None of the above") 

The correct answer is not among the choices given. The expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is 11,760, which is not one of the answer choices.
Response 1:
Let S be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013. Since the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 was (S-5600)/5600 = 0.05S/56, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 was 2(0.05S/56) = 0.05S/28. Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 was S + (0.05S/28)S = S(1 + 0.05/28) = S(107/56). Substituting S = 5880, we get that the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 was 5880(107/56) ≈ 11340. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Unfortunately, there is an error in this question as there is no data provided for 2014 subscriptions sold. Therefore, it is impossible to answer this question with the given information.
Response 3:
There seems to be some missing information in the question, specifically the data for the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Without this information, it is not possible to answer the question.
Response 4:
The table provides information on subscriptions sold in 2012 and 2013. To estimate the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, we need to first determine the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 and the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $(5,880-5,600)/5,600 \times 100\% = 5\%$. 

Since the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is half of the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, we have $\dfrac{x}{2} = 0.05$. Solving for x, we get $x = 0.1$. Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $5,880 \times (1+0.1) = 6,468.$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
First, we need to find the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is given by $\frac{x - 5{,}880}{5{,}880} \times 100\% = \frac{x}{5{,}880} \times 100\%$. 

Next, we need to find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013, which is given by $\frac{5{,}880 - 5{,}600}{5{,}600} \times 100\% = 5\%$. 

Since the manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, we have:

$$2 \times 5\% = \frac{x}{5{,}880} \times 100\%$$

Simplifying this equation gives $x = 6{,}168$. Therefore, the manager expected 6,168 subscriptions to be sold in 2014.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
The question mentions an expected percent increase from 2012 to 2013 and an expected percent increase from 2013 to 2014. However, there is no information given about the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate how many subscriptions the manager expected would be sold in 2014. The answer is "None of the Above".
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")  

We can start by finding the percent increase from 2012 to 2013:
$$\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\times 100\% \approx 5\%$$
Let $x$ be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, according to the problem, we have:
$$2x = \frac{5880(1+x)-5880}{5880}\times 100\% \approx 10.34\%$$
Solving for $x$, we get $x\approx 5.17\%$. Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is approximately:
$$5880(1+0.0517) \approx 6468$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 6,468}$.
Response 8:
First, we need to calculate the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 and from 2013 to 2014. 

The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is: 

$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05$ or 5%. 

To estimate the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, we need to make an assumption. Let's assume that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $x$%. Then, according to the problem, we have: 

$2(5\%) = x\%$

Solving for $x$, we get: 

$x = 10\%$

So, we expect the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 to be: 

$5,880 \times (1 + 10\%) = 6,468$ 

Therefore, the answer is (D) 6,468.

Question: A customer paid $\$ 53.00$ for a jacket after a 6 percent sales tax was added. What was the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 47.60$
  B: $\$ 50.00$
  C: $\$ 52.60$
  D: $\$ 52.84$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let the price of the jacket before tax be $x$. 
The amount paid by the customer after adding 6% sales tax is: 
\begin{align*}
\$ 53 &= x + 0.06x \\
&= 1.06x \\
\end{align*}
Solving for $x$ we get $x = \frac{\$ 53}{1.06} \approx \$ 50. Answer(\text{B})$.
Response 5:
Let's first find out the amount of tax paid on the jacket.
$6\%$ of $x$ is $\frac{6}{100}x = 0.06x$
So, the total amount paid for the jacket is $x+0.06x=1.06x$ (where $x$ is the price of the jacket before tax).
We know that the total amount paid for the jacket is $\$53.00$, so we can set up the equation:
$1.06x = 53$
Solving for $x$, we get:
$x = \frac{53}{1.06} = 50$
Therefore, the price of the jacket before tax was $\$50.00$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let's assume the price of the jacket before tax was $x$ dollars. Then, we know that the customer paid $6\%$ tax on $x$ and the total amount paid was $\$53.00$. Thus,

$$x + 0.06x = 53$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$1.06x = 53$$

Dividing by 1.06 on both sides, we get:

$$x = \frac{53}{1.06} \approx 50$$

So, the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added was $\$50.00$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let x be the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added. 
After the sales tax, the price becomes: x + 6% of x = x + 0.06x = 1.06x.
We know that 1.06x = 53, so x = 53/1.06 = 50.
Therefore, the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added is $\$ 50.00$, so the answer is:

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company purchased a machine valued at $\$ 120,000$. The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year so that after 10 years the value will be $\$ 30,000$. Which of the following equations gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased for $0 \leq t \leq 10 ?$
Choices:
  A: $v=30,000-9,000 t$
  B: $v=120,000-9,000 t$
  C: $v=120,000+9,000 t$
  D: $v=120,000-30,000 t$
Response 0:
The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year, so the value decreases by $\frac{120,000-30,000}{10}=9,000$ dollars each year. 

Let $v$ be the value of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased for $0 \leq t \leq 10$. 

The initial value of the machine is $\$120,000$, so when $t=0$, $v=120,000$. 

Over $t$ years, the value of the machine decreases by $9,000t$, so the equation that represents the value of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased is:

$v=120,000-9,000t$

Therefore, the answer is (A): $v=30,000-9,000t$.
Response 1:
The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year, so the total amount of depreciation after 10 years is $120,000 - 30,000 = 90,000$. The value of the machine decreased by $90,000$ over a period of 10 years, so the yearly depreciation is $9,000$. 

At time $t=0$, the value of the machine is $\$120,000$. For each year that passes, the value decreases by $9,000$. Therefore, the equation that gives the value, $v$, of the machine, $t$ years after it was purchased is:

$v = 120,000 - 9,000t$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let $d$ be the depreciation amount per year. It depreciates by $d$ dollars per year for 10 years, so the value of the machine in $t$ years, $0 \leq t \leq 10$ is $v=120,000-dt$. 

We can solve for $d$ by using the information that after 10 years, the value of the machine is $30,000$. Substituting $t=10$ and $v=30,000$, we get $30,000=120,000-d(10)$, which gives $d=9,000$. 

Therefore, the equation that gives the value of the machine in $t$ years is $v=120,000-9,000t$, so the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
To find the depreciation per year, we subtract the final value from the initial value and divide by the number of years: $\frac{\$120,\!000 - \$30,\!000}{10 \text{ years}} = \$9,\!000.$ We can use this information to set up an equation for the value of the machine in dollars, $v$, $t$ years after it was purchased: $v = \$120,\!000 - \$9,\!000t.$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
We know that the value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year, which means the rate of depreciation is constant. Let $r$ be the rate of depreciation (in dollars per year). Then, the initial value of the machine is $v_0 = 120,000$ and the value of the machine after 10 years is $v_{10} = 30,000$. 

We can use the formula for linear depreciation: $v_t = v_0 - rt$, where $v_t$ is the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased. 

Using the given information, we have:

$v_{10} = v_0 - 10r = 30,000$

$v_0 = 120,000$

Solving for $r$ gives $r = 9,000$. 

So the equation that gives the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased is:

$v_t = v_0 - rt = 120,000 - 9,000t$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
We can start by using the given information to find the rate at which the value of the machine is depreciating. The machine loses a total value of $\$ 120,000 - \$ 30,000 = \$ 90,000$ in 10 years, so it must be losing $\$ 9,000$ in value each year. 

We can use this rate to write an equation for the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased. At time $t=0$, the machine is worth $\$ 120,000$, so we have an initial value of $v_0 = 120,000$. Then, for each year that passes, the value decreases by $\$ 9,000$, so the equation is:

$$v = v_0 - 9,000t$$

Substituting in $v_0 = 120,000$, we get:

$$v = 120,000 - 9,000t$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
We can use the information given to create a linear equation in slope-intercept form: $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope (rate of depreciation) and $b$ is the initial value (value at $t=0$). We know that the initial value is $\$120,000$ and that the value after 10 years is $\$30,000$, so we can set up the equation:

$30,000 = m(10) + 120,000$

Simplifying this equation gives:

$m = -9,000$

So the equation that gives the value of the machine, $v$, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased is:

$v = -9,000t + 120,000$

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
The initial value of the machine is $120,000$ dollars and it depreciates by the same amount each year. After $10$ years, the value of the machine will be $30,000$ dollars. So, over the course of $10$ years, the machine has lost $120,000-30,000=90,000$ dollars in value. Therefore, the value of the machine decreases by $9,000$ dollars each year. 

To find the equation that gives the value of the machine, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation: $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$ where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line. 

We know that the initial value of the machine is $120,000$, so we can use the point $(0,120,000)$. We also know that the slope of the line is $-9,000$ (negative because the value is decreasing). 

Using the point-slope form, we get:

$$v-120,000=-9,000t$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$v=-9,000t+120,000$$

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(B)}.$

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& x=y-3 \\& \frac{x}{2}+2 y=6\end{aligned}$$Which ordered pair $(x, y)$ satisfies the system of equations shown above?
Choices:
  A: $(-3,0)$
  B: $(0,3)$
  C: $(6,-3)$
  D: $(36,-6)$
Response 0:
To solve the system of equations, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation for $x:$
$$\frac{x}{2}+2y=\frac{y-3}{2}+2y=\frac{5y-6}{2}=6.$$Solving for $y$ gives $y=3.$ Substituting $y=3$ back into the first equation gives $x=0.$ Thus the solution is $(0,3).$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
We can substitute $x$ in the second equation with the expression given for $x$ in the first equation, then simplify to solve for $y$. 

$$\begin{aligned} \frac{x}{2} +2y &=6 \\ \frac{(y-3)}{2}+2y &=6 \\ y-3+4y &=12 \\ 5y &=15 \\ y &=3 \end{aligned}$$

Now we can substitute $y=3$ back into the first equation to solve for $x$.

$$\begin{aligned} x &= y-3 \\ x &= 3-3 \\ x &= 0 \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the ordered pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the system is $(0,3)$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
To solve the system of equations, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get a single equation with one variable. 
$$\begin{aligned} \frac{x}{2}+2 y &=6 \\ \frac{(y-3)}{2}+2 y &=6 \\ 3 y-3 &=6 \\ y&=3 \end{aligned}$$
Then we can substitute $y=3$ into the first equation to find $x$.
$$\begin{aligned} x&=y-3 \\ x&=3-3 \\ x&=0 \end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the solution is $(x,y)=(0,3)$, which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.
Response 4:
Substitute the first equation into the second equation to get $$\frac{y-3}{2}+2 y=6$$ Simplifying the equation above, we get $5y=15$, so $y=3$. Substituting $y=3$ back into the first equation gives $x=0$. Thus, the answer is $(0,3)$, which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.
Response 5:
To solve the system of equations, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation and get: $$\frac{y-3}{2}+2y=6$$ Simplifying, we get: $$\frac{5y}{2}=9$$ Then, we can solve for $y$ to get $y=\frac{18}{5}$. 

Substituting this value of $y$ back into the first equation, we get: $$x=\frac{18}{5}-3=\frac{3}{5}$$

Therefore, the ordered pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the system of equations is $\left(\frac{3}{5},\frac{18}{5}\right)$.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week?
Choices:
  A: 38
  B: 33
  C: 22
  D: 16
Response 0:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, Ken earns $8 \cdot 10 + 10x$ dollars total. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, which means he saves $0.9(8\cdot10)+0.9(10x)=7.2+9x$ dollars. We want this to be at least $270$, so we have the inequality $7.2+9x\geq 270$. Solving for $x$, we get $x\geq 30$. Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 38}$.
Response 1:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week. Since he worked $10$ hours at $\$ 8$, he earned $\$ 80$ from those hours. For the remaining hours, he earns $\$ 10$ per hour. Therefore, his total earnings for the week is $80 + 10x$. He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$ dollars for the week.

We want to solve the inequality $72+9x\geq 270$, which simplifies to $9x\geq 198$. Dividing both sides by $9$, we get $x\geq 22$. Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 2:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then the amount of money he earns is $8 \cdot 10 + 10x = 80+10x$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of this, which is $0.9(80+10x)$. We want this quantity to be at least $\$270$, so we have the inequality $0.9(80+10x) \geq 270$. Simplifying this inequality gives $x \geq 16$. The least integer greater than or equal to $16$ is $16$, so Ken must work at least $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 16}$ more hours to save at least $\$270$.
Response 3:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken worked after the first 10 hours. Then the total amount of money he earned is $8 \cdot 10 + 10x = 80+10x$. He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10x) = 72+9x$. We are given that he saves at least $\$ 270$, so we have $72+9x\geq 270$. Solving for $x$, we get $x\geq 22$. Thus Ken must work a minimum of $22$ hours. 

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's first find the amount Ken earns from the first 10 hours of work, which is $8 \times 10 = 80$ dollars. 

Let's now find how much Ken earns per hour after the first 10 hours of work, which is $10 - 8 = 2$ dollars. 

Let's say he works $x$ more hours after the first 10 hours. Then he earns $2x$ dollars from those hours. 

The total amount he earns for the week is $80 + 2x$. To save at least $\$270$, he needs to save $90\%$ of his earnings, which is $0.9(80+2x)$. 

So we have the inequality $0.9(80+2x) \geq 270$, which simplifies to $80+2x \geq 300$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \geq 110/2$, which is $x \geq 55$. 

Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $55$ hours. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken needs to work with a salary of $\$ 10$ per hour. The amount he earns in the first $10$ hours is $\$ 8 \cdot 10 = \$ 80$. The amount he earns in the remaining $x$ hours is $\$ 10x$. Thus, his total earnings are $\$ 80 + \$ 10x$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(\$ 80 + \$ 10x) = \$ 72 + \$ 9x$ for the week. We set this expression greater than or equal to $\$ 270$ and solve for $x$: \begin{align*}
\$ 72 + \$ 9x &\geq \$ 270\\
\$ 9x &\geq \$ 198\\
x &\geq 22
\end{align*} Thus, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 22}$.
Response 6:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken needs to work at $\$10$ per hour. Then, his total earnings for the week will be $8\cdot 10+10x$. Since Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, he will save $0.9(80+10x)$ dollars. We need this quantity to be at least $\$270$, so we can write the inequality: $$0.9(80+10x)\geq 270.$$ Simplifying this inequality, we get $x\geq 13$. Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$.
Response 7:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works at $\$10$ per hour. Then, we know that he worked a total of $10+x$ hours during the week. 

Ken earned $\$8$ per hour for the first $10$ hours of the week. Therefore, he earned a total of $\$8\times 10$ for those hours.

For the remaining $x$ hours, Ken earned $\$10$ per hour. Therefore, he earned a total of $\$10x$ for those hours.

So, his total earnings for the week are $\$8\times 10 + \$10x = \$80 + \$10x$.

Ken saves $90\%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(\$80+\$10x) = \$72 + \$9x$.

We need to find the least value of $x$ such that $\$72 + \$9x \geq \$270$, or $x \geq 22$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 8:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week.
Then, his earnings for the entire week is $8 \cdot 10 + 10x = 80 + 10x$ dollars.
Since he saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, he saves $0.9(80+10x) = 72 + 9x$ dollars.
We want to solve $72+9x \geq 270$ to find the least number of hours he must work for the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$. 
Simplifying the inequality gives $x \geq 22$. 
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 9:
Let's begin with the calculation of Ken's earning in the first 10 hours of the week. He earns $\$ 8$ per hour, and he worked for 10 hours. So, he earned $\$ 8 \cdot 10 = \$ 80$ in the first 10 hours. 

Now, we need to find how many hours he should work with $\$ 10$ per hour wage to reach his saving goal. Let's assume that he works $x$ hours. So, he will earn $\$ 10x$ in the remaining part of the week. 

He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, which means he spends only $10 \%$ of his earnings. Therefore, he will spend $100 \% - 90 \% = 10 \%$ of his earnings. 

We want to find the least number of hours that he must work to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week. So, the inequality we need to solve is:

$$
0.1 \left(\$ 80 + \$ 10x\right) \geq \$ 270
$$

Simplifying the inequality, we have:

$$
\$ 8 + \$ x \geq 27
$$

Therefore, Ken must work at least $\$ 19$ with his new salary. Since he earns $\$ 10$ per hour, he needs to work at least $\frac{\$ 19}{\$ 10} \approx 1.9$ hours, which means he needs to work for at least 2 hours to achieve his goal. 

Adding the first 10 hours, the total hours he needs to work is $10 + 2 = 12$ hours.

Therefore, the answer is:

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages. For each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. What is the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 6
Response 0:
Let's assume the number of 100-pound packages to be x and the number of 120-pound packages to be y. We have two constraints:
1. x + y >= 10 (At least 10 packages)
2. 100x + 120y <= 1100 (Total weight of packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)

We need to maximize y, which represents the number of 120-pound packages.
Let's solve the two constraints to find the maximum value of y.

1. x + y >= 10
y >= 10 - x

2. 100x + 120y <= 1100
10x + 12y <= 110
5x + 6y <= 55
y <= (55-5x)/6

To maximize y, we need to make the right-hand side of the second inequality as small as possible. This occurs when x = 5. 
Substituting x = 5 into the first inequality, we get y >= 5.
Substituting x = 5 into the second inequality, we get y <= 4.16
Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages the helicopter can carry per trip is 4.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries "x" number of 100-pound packages and "y" number of 120-pound packages. We know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so we can write the equation: 

x + y ≥ 10 

We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so we can write another equation: 

100x + 120y ≤ 1,100 

We want to find the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip, which means we want to maximize "y". We can solve for "y" in the first equation: 

y ≥ 10 - x 

We can substitute this expression for "y" into the second equation: 

100x + 120(10 - x) ≤ 1,100 

Simplifying this expression: 

-20x + 1200 ≤ 1,100 

-20x ≤ -100 

x ≥ 5 

So the helicopter must carry at least 5 100-pound packages. We can substitute this value for "x" in the expression for "y": 

y ≥ 10 - 5 

y ≥ 5 

So the helicopter must carry at least 5 120-pound packages. We can also substitute these values for "x" and "y" in the second equation to check that the total weight is at most 1,100 pounds: 

100(5) + 120(5) = 1,100 

So the helicopter can carry at most 5 120-pound packages per trip. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries 'x' packages of 100 pounds each and 'y' packages of 120 pounds each. From the problem statement, we have the following conditions:
x + y >= 10 (the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
100x + 120y <= 1100 (the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)

We want to find the maximum value of 'y' that satisfies these conditions. 

Action: Answer("C") 

To solve this problem, we can start by simplifying the second inequality:
100x + 120y <= 1100
Dividing both sides by 20, we get:
5x + 6y <= 55

Now we have two inequalities:
x + y >= 10
5x + 6y <= 55

To find the maximum value of 'y', we can start by graphing these two inequalities on the coordinate plane and shading the region that satisfies both inequalities. Alternatively, we can solve for 'y' in the first inequality and substitute it into the second inequality, giving us:
y >= 10 - x
5x + 6(10 - x) <= 55
Simplifying, we get:
x <= 5
y >= 4

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5, since carrying 6 would exceed the weight limit.
Response 3:
Let x be the number of 100-pound packages and y be the number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip. Then we have the following system of inequalities:
```
x + y >= 10        (the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
100x + 120y <= 1100  (the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)
```
To maximize y, we want to first convert the inequalities into equations and then solve for y in terms of x. Solving the first inequality for y, we get y >= 10 - x. Substituting this into the second inequality and simplifying, we get:
```
y <= (-5/6)x + (55/6)
```
The maximum value of y occurs when x is as small as possible. The smallest integer value of x that satisfies the first inequality is x = 6 (when y = 4). Substituting x = 6 into the second inequality, we get y <= 1.67. The largest integer value of y that satisfies this inequality is y = 1. Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 4. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let's suppose that the helicopter carries x 100-pound packages and y 120-pound packages. 

We know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so: 

x + y >= 10 

Also, the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so: 

100x + 120y <= 1100 

We want to find the maximum number of 120-pound packages, which means we need to maximize y. 

We can solve this problem using linear programming, but an easier way is to test the answer choices. 

If the helicopter carries 6 120-pound packages, then it can carry 4 100-pound packages: 

100(4) + 120(6) = 880 

This is less than 1,100, so choice D is possible. 

If the helicopter carries 5 120-pound packages, then it can carry 5 100-pound packages: 

100(5) + 120(5) = 1100 

This is exactly 1,100, so choice C is the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries "x" 100-pound packages and "y" 120-pound packages. We have two equations from the given information:
1. x + y ≥ 10 (the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
2. 100x + 120y ≤ 1100 (the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)

We want to find the maximum value of "y". To do this, we need to solve for "y" in terms of "x" in the second equation:
120y ≤ 1100 - 100x
y ≤ (1100 - 100x)/120

So, the maximum value of "y" occurs when (1100 - 100x)/120 is as large as possible. This occurs when x is as small as possible (since 1100 - 100x decreases as x increases). The smallest possible value of x is 5 (since if x = 4, we would need y ≥ 6, which violates the first equation). Plugging in x = 5, we get:
y ≤ (1100 - 100(5))/120 = 5

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's call the number of 100-pound packages "x" and the number of 120-pound packages "y". We know that:
- x + y must be at least 10 (because the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
- 100x + 120y must be at most 1,100 (because the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 20:
- 5x + 6y <= 55

Now we can graph the inequality 5x + 6y <= 55 and find the integer solutions for x and y that satisfy both inequalities. The graph will be a straight line with slope -5/6 and y-intercept 55/6. We can test a few integer solutions to see which ones satisfy the inequality:
- (x=0, y=9) satisfies the inequality: 5(0) + 6(9) = 54 <= 55
- (x=2, y=8) satisfies the inequality: 5(2) + 6(8) = 56 > 55
- (x=4, y=7) satisfies the inequality: 5(4) + 6(7) = 58 > 55

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 7.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries "x" 100-pound packages and "y" 120-pound packages per trip. 
Then the equation representing the total weight of the packages can be written as:
100x + 120y <= 1100

Also, we know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages per trip. So, we can write another equation as:
x + y >= 10

We want to find the maximum value of "y" that satisfies both of these equations.
Let's solve for "y" in the second equation:
y >= 10 - x

Now substitute this inequality in the first equation:
100x + 120y <= 1100
100x + 120(10-x) <= 1100
100x + 1200 - 120x <= 1100
-20x <= -100
x >= 5

So, "x" should be at least 5. Let's try different values of "x" and see how many 120-pound packages we can carry.
If x=5, then y >= 10-5 = 5 and 100(5) + 120y <= 1100, so y <= 5.8 (not an integer)
If x=6, then y >= 10-6 = 4 and 100(6) + 120y <= 1100, so y <= 5 (an integer)

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let x be the number of 120-pound packages and y be the number of 100-pound packages. Then we have the following system of inequalities:

x + y >= 10 (the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
120x + 100y <= 1100 (the total weight of the packages can be at most 1100 pounds)

We want to maximize x, so we can rewrite the first inequality as y >= 10 - x. Substituting this into the second inequality, we get:

120x + 100(10 - x) <= 1100
20x <= 100
x <= 5

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline0 & 3 \\\hline2 & 1 \\\hline4 & 0 \\\hline5 & -2 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The function $f$ is defined by a polynomial. Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-2$
  B: $x-3$
  C: $x-4$
  D: $x-5$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A") 

We can see from the table that $f(2)=1$ and $f(0)=3$. Therefore, $(x-2)$ must be a factor of the polynomial. We can verify that the other options are not necessarily factors by plugging in the values given in the table.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A") 

Explanation: 
For a polynomial to have a factor $(x-a)$, the value of $a$ must be a root of the polynomial. We can check that $f(2)=1$, so $(x-2)$ must be a factor of $f(x)$. We can also see that $f(1)=2$ and $f(3)=-2$, which means the polynomial has no roots between $x=2$ and $x=4$. Therefore, $(x-3)$ and $(x-4)$ cannot be factors of $f(x)$. Finally, we can check that $f(5)=-2$, so $(x-5)$ is not a factor of $f(x)$ either. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ x-2}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A") 

We can see that $f(2)=1$ and $f(0)=3$. Since $f(x)$ is defined by a polynomial, we can say that $(x-2)$ is a factor of $f(x)$ by the Factor Theorem.
Response 9:
Since the function $f$ is defined by a polynomial, and we are given some of its values, we can use finite differences to determine if there is a linear factor. The first differences are  \begin{align*}
f(2)-f(0)&=1-3=-2,\\
f(4)-f(2)&=0-1=-1,\\
f(5)-f(4)&=-2-0=-2.
\end{align*}The second differences are $1-(-2)=3$ and $-2-(-1)=-1,$ respectively. Since the second differences are not equal, the function $f$ is not defined by a quadratic polynomial. Thus, we test which of the choices is a factor of the cubic polynomial that defines $f(x)$ by synthetic division: \[
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{3}&-3&-8&6\\ \cline{2-6}
4&\big)\!&3&0&-8&-20 \\
\multicolumn{2}{r}{}&12&48&160\\
\cline{2-5}
\multicolumn{2}{r}{}&3&12&152&\text{R }140
\end{array}
\]Therefore, the remainder is 140, and the only factor is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }x-5}.$

Choices:
  A: $-14-18 i$
  B: $-4-6 i$
  C: $4+6 i$
  D: $14+18 i$
Response 0:
Solution:
Note that $i^2=-1$. Therefore, we have: 

$$(5+12 i)-\left(9 i^{2}-6 i\right)=(5+12 i)-\left(9 (-1)-6 i\right)=5+12i+9+6i=14+18i$$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 14+18i}$

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$
Response 0:
We can start by finding the rate of decrease in millions of barrels per year. From 2000 to 2013, there are 13 years, so the total decrease is $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels. Therefore, the rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13}\approx0.162$ million barrels per year. This means that the function $f(t)$ must have a slope of approximately $-0.162$. 

Next, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the y-intercept. We know that $f(0)=4$ since the production in 2000 was 4 million barrels. Therefore, the equation of the linear function is:

$$f(t) = -0.162t + 4$$

which is closest to choice:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To find the best linear function to model the production, we need to use the given information to find the slope of the line, which represents the rate of change of the production per year. We can use the slope formula:

slope = $\frac{\text{change in production}}{\text{change in time}}$

The change in production is the difference between the final and initial production:

change in production = 1.9 - 4 = -2.1 million barrels

The change in time is the difference between the final and initial years, which is 13:

change in time = 13

Therefore, the slope of the line is:

slope = $\frac{-2.1}{13} \approx -0.162$

Now we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to write the function:

$f(t) - 4 = -0.162(t - 0)$

$f(t) = -0.162t + 4$

So the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
We can use the slope-intercept form of a line, $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production, $y$, decreased from 4 million to 1.9 million over a span of 13 years. So, the slope of the function would be:

$$m = \frac{1.9 - 4}{13} = -\frac{21}{130}$$

To find the y-intercept, we can use one of the points. Let's use the point $(0,4)$, since that's the starting point:

$$y = mx + b$$
$$4 = -\frac{21}{130}(0) + b$$
$$b = 4$$

So the equation of the linear function is:

$$f(t) = -\frac{21}{130}t + 4$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$.
Response 3:
We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the answer. We know that the initial production in 2000 was 4 million barrels, which corresponds to the point $(0,4)$ on the graph. We also know that the production in 2013 was 1.9 million barrels, which corresponds to the point $(13,1.9)$ on the graph. The slope of the line is given by:

slope = $\frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}} = \frac{1.9-4}{13-0} = -\frac{21}{130}$

Using the point-slope form of a linear equation, we get:

$f(t) - 4 = -\frac{21}{130} t$

$f(t) = -\frac{21}{130} t + 4$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.
Response 4:
To find the best linear function, we need to use the given data to calculate the rate of decrease of oil and gas production. The production decreased by $4-1.9 = 2.1$ million barrels over 13 years, so the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13} \approx 0.1615$ million barrels per year. 

The function should have a slope of $-0.1615$, which eliminates choices A and B. To determine the y-intercept, we can plug in the point $(0, 4)$, where $t=0$ corresponds to the year 2000. We get:

$f(0) = b = 4$

So the correct function is:

$f(t) = -0.1615t + 4$

which is equivalent to:

$f(t) = \frac{-1615}{10000}t + 4$

Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To find the function, we need to determine the slope of the line connecting the two points $(0,4)$ and $(13,1.9)$ since the production decreased at a constant rate. 

The slope of the line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. 

Using the two points $(0,4)$ and $(13,1.9)$, we have
\begin{align*}
m &= \frac{1.9-4}{13-0} \\
&= \frac{-2.1}{13} \\
&= -\frac{21}{130}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the function that models the production, $f(t)$, is $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
To find the slope of the line, we calculate the change in $y$ over the change in $x$: $\frac{1.9-4}{13}= -\frac{21}{130}$. We can check that this slope matches that of choice (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$. Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To determine which linear function best models the production, we can use the two given data points: $(0, 4)$ and $(13, 1.9)$. The slope of the line is equal to the rate of decrease in millions of barrels per year. We can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept, to find the equation of the line that passes through these two points. 

The slope is $m=\frac{1.9-4}{13-0}=-\frac{21}{130}$. The y-intercept is $b=4$. Thus, the equation of the line is $y=-\frac{21}{130}x+4$. 

Therefore, the answer is  $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4}$.
Response 8:
To find which linear function best models the oil and gas production, we need to use the two given data points: $(0,4)$ and $(13,1.9)$.

The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by:

$$m = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$

Using the two given data points, we get:

$$m = \frac{1.9-4}{13-0} = -\frac{21}{130}$$

So, the slope of the linear function we need to find is $-\frac{21}{130}$.

We can now check which of the given functions has a slope of $-\frac{21}{130}$.

A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$ has a slope of $\frac{21}{130}$, which is not correct.

B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$ has a slope of $\frac{19}{130}$, which is not correct.

C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$ has a slope of $-\frac{21}{130}$, which is correct.

D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$ has a slope of $-\frac{19}{130}$, which is not correct.

Therefore, the best linear function that models the oil and gas production is $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$, so the answer is C. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To find the linear function that models the production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of the equation: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels over a period of 13 years. Therefore, the average decrease per year is $\frac{2.1}{13}\approx 0.162$ million barrels per year.

The slope of the function $f$ is equal to the average decrease per year, which is approximately $-0.162$. 

To find the $y$-intercept, we can use the fact that the production was 4 million barrels in the year 2000, which means that $f(0)=4$. Therefore, the $y$-intercept is 4.

Putting it all together, we get that the function $f$ is given by:

$$f(t)=-0.162t+4$$

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline1 & 5 \\\hline3 & 13 \\\hline5 & 21 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of the linear function $f$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=2 x+3$
  B: $f(x)=3 x+2$
  C: $f(x)=4 x+1$
  D: $f(x)=5 x$
Response 0:
To find the answer, we need to find the slope and $y$-intercept of the linear function $f$. We can do this by using any two of the points shown in the table. Let's use the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$. The slope of the line passing through these points is $\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. Therefore, the slope of the function $f$ is $4$.  

To find the $y$-intercept, we can use the point $(1,5)$ and the slope we just found. We know that a point-slope equation of a line is $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$. Using this equation with $(x_1,y_1)=(1,5)$ and $m=4$ gives $y - 5 = 4(x - 1)$. Simplifying this equation gives $y = 4x + 1$. Thus, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
We can determine the slope of the line using any two points on the line. Let's use the first and second points: the slope is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. Therefore, we can eliminate choices (A), (B), and (C) since their slopes are different from 4. Now we only have one choice left, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ f(x)=5x}$.
Response 3:
We can see that $f(1)=5$, $f(3)=13$, and $f(5)=21$. 

To find the slope, we can use two of the points:
$$\text{slope}=\frac{f(3)-f(1)}{3-1}=\frac{13-5}{2}=4$$

So the equation of the line can be written in slope-intercept form as:
$$f(x)=mx+b$$
where $m=4$ is the slope. 

To find the $y$-intercept, we can use the point $(1,5)$:
$$5=4(1)+b\Rightarrow b=1$$

Therefore, the equation of the line is:
$$f(x)=4x+1$$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
To solve this problem, we need to check which of the answer choices correctly gives the slope of the line that passes through the points $(1,5)$, $(3,13)$, and $(5,21)$. We can use the formula for slope, which is rise over run or $\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, where $\Delta y$ is the change in $y$ and $\Delta x$ is the change in $x$.

Using the first and second points, we get a slope of $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. Using the second and third points, we get a slope of $\frac{21-13}{5-3}=4$. Therefore, we know that the slope of the line is 4.

Now we can check which of the answer choices gives a line with a slope of 4. The only answer choice that works is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f(x)=3x+2}$.
Response 5:
We see that when $x=1$, $f(x)=5$. When $x=3$, $f(x)=13$. And when $x=5$, $f(x)=21$. We can observe that for each increase of $2$ in $x$, $f(x)$ increases by $8$. Hence, we can write $f(x)$ as $f(x)=8x-3$. 

Therefore, 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
We can see from the table that when $x=0$, $f(x)=5-2\cdot1=3$. Similarly, when $x=2$, $f(x)=13-2\cdot3=7$, and when $x=4$, $f(x)=21-2\cdot5=11$. Thus, the slope of the line connecting $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ is $$\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4,$$and so the equation of the line is $$y=4x+1.$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4x+1}$.
Response 7:
We notice that each time $x$ increases by $2$, $f(x)$ increases by $8$. Therefore, the slope of the line is $8/2 = 4$. We also observe that when $x=1$, $f(x) = 5$. This means that the $y$-intercept is $1$. The equation of the line can be written in slope-intercept form as $f(x) = 4x + 1$. Thus, 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We can solve for the slope of the line using any two points given in the table. Using $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ we get $m=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. Therefore the equation of the line can be written in slope-intercept form as $f(x) = mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Substituting $(1,5)$ we can solve for $b$ as follows: $5=4(1)+b\Rightarrow b=1$. So, $f(x) = 4x+1$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4 x+1}$.
Response 9:
We can use the given values to form a system of linear equations and solve for the coefficients of the linear function $f$. Using the points $(1,5)$, $(3,13)$, and $(5,21)$, we get the following system of equations: 

$5 = a(1) + b$
$13 = a(3) + b$
$21 = a(5) + b$

Solving this system yields $a=4$ and $b=1$. Therefore, the function $f$ is given by $f(x) = 4x + 1$.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Dreams Recalled during One Week\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\hline& None & 1 to 4 & 5 or more & Total \\\hline\hlineGroup X & 15 & 28 & 57 & 100 \\\hlineGroup Y & 21 & 11 & 68 & 100 \\\hlineTotal & 36 & 39 & 125 & 200 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The data in the table above were produced by a sleep researcher studying the number of dreams people recall when asked to record their dreams for one week. Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$
Response 0:
The probability that a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{39+125}{200}=0.82$. The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{68}{125+39}=\frac{68}{164} \approx 0.415$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y can be calculated by dividing the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream by the total number of people who recalled at least one dream. This can be represented as:

$\frac{\text{Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}}$

The total number of people who recalled at least one dream is:

$39+125=164$

The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream is:

$11+68=79$

So the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is:

$\frac{79}{164}$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\frac{79}{164}$.
Response 2:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is equal to the number of people who belong to Group Y and recalled at least one dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least one dream. From the table, we know that 68 people from Group Y recalled at least one dream. Similarly, 28 people from Group X recalled 1 to 4 dreams and 57 people from Group X recalled 5 or more dreams, for a total of 85 people from Group X who recalled at least one dream. Therefore, the total number of people who recalled at least one dream is 68+85=153. So, the probability that a person chosen at random who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y is $\frac{68}{153}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Out of the 39 people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams, 11 belonged to Group Y. Out of the 125 people who recalled 5 or more dreams, 68 belonged to Group Y. Therefore, out of the total of 164 people who recalled at least 1 dream, 79 belonged to Group Y. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Out of the 39 people who recalled 1 or more dream, 68 - 39 = 29 people belonged to Group Y. So the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{29}{39} = \frac{79}{107} \approx 0.7383$$

Rounded to four decimal places, the answer is approximately 0.7383. 

Therefore, the best answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
The probability of selecting a person from Group Y is the ratio of the number of people from Group Y to the total number of people who recalled at least one dream. That is, $$\frac{68}{39+68+125} = \frac{68}{232} = \frac{17}{58}.$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{79}{164}}$.
Response 6:
We are given that a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream. This means that we must only consider the rows in the table where the total number of dreams recalled is greater than or equal to 1. 

Looking at the table, we see that the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $39+125=164$. Out of these 164 people, 68 belonged to Group Y. Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{68}{164}=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$$
Response 7:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least one dream, which is $\frac{68}{125+39} = \frac{68}{164}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We are looking for the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given they recalled at least one dream. That means we need to consider the second row of the table, which gives the breakdown of people who recalled at least one dream. Out of the 39 people who recalled at least one dream, 68 - 11 = 57 belonged to Group Y. So the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{57}{39}= \frac{19}{13}$$

This is not one of the answer choices, so we need to simplify. We can see that both the numerator and denominator are divisible by 19, so we can simplify to:

$$\frac{19}{13} = \frac{1}{13}\cdot 19 = \frac{19}{169}$$

Now we need to look for an answer choice that is equivalent to $\frac{19}{169}$. We can see that $\frac{79}{164}$ is equivalent:

$$\frac{19}{169} = \frac{79}{4\cdot 169} = \frac{79}{676} = \frac{79}{164}\cdot\frac{1}{2}$$

So the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is the number of people who recalled at least 1 dream from Group Y divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. From the table, we see that a total of $39+125=164$ people recalled at least 1 dream. Out of those, 68 people were from Group Y. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{68}{164}=\frac{17}{41}$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\frac{79}{164}$.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$C=75 h+125$$The equation above gives the amount $C$, in dollars, an electrician charges for a job that takes $h$ hours. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland each hired this electrician. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. How much more did the electrician charge Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 75$
  B: $\$ 125$
  C: $\$ 150$
  D: $\$ 275$
Response 0:
Let's start by finding the cost for Mr. Roland's job. Let's say he got charged $R$ dollars for the job that took $h$ hours. Then, we can write:
$$R=75h+125$$
Now, for Ms. Sanchez's job, we know that the electrician worked for 2 hours longer, which means her job took $(h+2)$ hours. Let's say she got charged $S$ dollars for the job. Then, we can write:
$$S=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$$
The difference in cost between Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland is:
$$S-R=(75h+225)-(75h+125)=100$$
So, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(A) }\$75}$.
Response 1:
Let's first find out how much the electrician charged for Mr. Roland's job. If he worked $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job, then the cost would be $C=75h+125$ dollars. For Ms. Sanchez's job, he worked $h+2$ hours. Therefore, the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job would be $C=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$ dollars. The difference in the cost between Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job would be $75h+225-(75h+125)=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }75}$ dollars.
Response 2:
Let's first find the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. If the electrician worked for $h$ hours on his job, then he worked for $h+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. Using the equation, the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job is $C=75h+125$. For Ms. Sanchez's job, the amount charged is $C=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$. Therefore, the difference between the amount charged for their jobs is: $$\begin{aligned}(75h+225)-(75h+125)&=75h-75h+225-125\\&=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$150}\end{aligned}$$
Response 3:
We can start by finding the difference in the number of hours worked on each job. We know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job, so we can represent the number of hours worked on Mr. Roland's job as $h$ and the number of hours worked on Ms. Sanchez's job as $h+2$. 

Next, we can use the equation given to find the cost of each job and then find the difference between the two costs: 

Cost for Mr. Roland's job: 
$$C = 75h + 125$$
$$C = 75( h) + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 125$$

Cost for Ms. Sanchez's job: 
$$C = 75(h+2) + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 150 + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 275$$

Difference in cost: 
$$(75h + 275) - (75h + 125) = 150$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$150}$.
Response 4:
Let the number of hours worked on Mr. Roland's job be $r$. Then, the number of hours worked on Ms. Sanchez's job was $r + 2$. 
The cost for Mr. Roland's job is $C = 75r+125$, and the cost for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C = 75(r+2)+125 = 75r+225$. 
The difference in cost between the two jobs is $75r+225-(75r+125)=100$. 
Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Let's begin by substituting $h+2$ for $h$ in the equation given, because the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. We get: $$C=75(h+2)+125$$ $$C=75h+150+125$$ $$C=75h+275$$ Now we can find the difference in cost by subtracting the cost of Mr. Roland's job from Ms. Sanchez's job, which will give us the amount charged more for Ms. Sanchez's job. $$\begin{aligned} \text{Difference in cost }&= \text{Cost of Ms. Sanchez's job }- \text{Cost of Mr. Roland's job} \\ &= (75(h+2)+125)-(75h+125) \\ &= 75h+150+125-75h-125 \\ &= \boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$ 150} \end{aligned}$$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$ 150}$.
Response 6:
Let's start by finding the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. If the electrician worked $h$ hours for Mr. Roland, then he worked $h+2$ hours for Ms. Sanchez. 

For Mr. Roland:
$$C=75h+125$$
For Ms. Sanchez:
$$C=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$$

So, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $C = 75h+225$ and charged Mr. Roland $C=75h+125$. 

To find how much more Ms. Sanchez was charged, we can subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job:
\begin{align*}
(75h+225)-(75h+125) &= 75h+225-75h-125 \\
&= \boxed{\$100}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is (none of the above) $\boxed{\$100}$.
Response 7:
Let's start by finding out how many hours the electrician worked on Mr. Roland's job. Let's call this time $t$:
$$t=h+2$$
This means that the amount Mr. Roland was charged is:
$$C_R=75t+125=75(h+2)+125=75h+275$$
Now let's find out the amount Ms. Sanchez was charged. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on her job, so the time he worked on her job is just $h+2$. Therefore, the amount Ms. Sanchez was charged is:
$$C_S=75(h+2)+125=75h+275$$
So the difference between what Ms. Sanchez was charged and what Mr. Roland was charged is:
$$C_S-C_R=(75h+275)-(75h+275)=0$$
This means that the electrician charged both of them the same amount, so the answer is:
Action: Answer("A") $\$75$
Response 8:
Let's start by finding the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. We can use the given formula to find that when the electrician works for $h$ hours, he charges $75h+125$ dollars. Let's assume that Mr. Roland's job took $x$ hours. Therefore, the electrician charged Mr. Roland $75x+125$ dollars.

We know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. Let's assume that Ms. Sanchez's job took $x+2$ hours. Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $75(x+2)+125$ dollars.

Now, let's find the difference between the amounts charged to Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland:

$$(75(x+2)+125)-(75x+125)$$
$$=75x+150+125-75x-125$$
$$=\$150$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$150}$.
Response 9:
Let's denote the amount charged by the electrician for Ms. Sanchez's job as $C_s$. Similarly, let's denote the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job as $C_r$. 

We know that $C_s = 75(h+2) + 125$ and $C_r = 75h + 125$, where $h$ is the number of hours spent on Mr. Roland's job. 

The difference in the amount charged is: 

\begin{align*}
C_s - C_r &= (75(h+2) + 125) - (75h + 125) \\
&= 75 \cdot 2 \\
&= 150
\end{align*}

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
The energy in 180 food calories is equal to the sum of the energy from each macronutrient: $180=4p+9f+4c$. Solving for $f$ gives $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$. Simplifying, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is (B). 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ denote the energy, in food calories, from $1$ gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. Then, the granola bar contains $E_p p$, $E_f f$, and $E_c c$ food calories from protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. Since the granola bar contains 180 food calories in total, we have the equation $E_p p + E_f f + E_c c = 180$. Substituting the values from the table, we have $4p + 9f + 4c = 180$, which simplifies to $4(p+c) = 180 - 9f$, or $f = \frac{4}{9}(p+c) - 20$. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
The total number of grams of the three macronutrients in the granola bar is $g=p+f+c$. The total number of food calories in the granola bar is $4g$. We are given that this is 180 food calories: $4g=180$. Solving for $g$, we have $g=45$.
The number of food calories from fat is $9f$. The number of food calories from protein is $4p$, and the number of food calories from carbohydrate is $4c$. The number of food calories from all three sources should add up to the total number of food calories: $9f+4p+4c=180$.
Solving for $f$, we have $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$. Simplifying, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 3:
Let's solve this problem using the given data. We have:
- Protein: 4.0 food calories per gram
- Fat: 9.0 food calories per gram
- Carbohydrate: 4.0 food calories per gram

Let $p$ grams of protein provide $4p$ food calories, $f$ grams of fat provide $9f$ food calories, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate provide $4c$ food calories. We know that the total calorie count of the granola bar is 180. Therefore, we can write the equation:

$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$

Solving for $f$, we get:

$9f = 180 - 4p - 4c$

$f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 4:
We know that the total energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories. Using the table, we can set up the equation: 
$4p+9f+4c=180$
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$4p+4c=180-9f$
$4(p+c)=180-9f$
$p+c=\frac{180-9f}{4}$
$p+c=45-\frac{9}{4}f$
$f=\frac{4}{9}(p+c)-20$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 5:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ denote the amounts of energy (in calories) that come from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, respectively. Then we have the equations: $E_p = 4p$, $E_f = 9f$, $E_c = 4c$, and $E_p + E_f + E_c = 180$. Substituting the first three equations into the fourth equation, we get $4p + 9f + 4c = 180$. Solving for $f$, we get $f = \frac{180-4p-4c}{9} = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 6:
The total amount of energy in a granola bar is 180 food calories, which is equal to $180/9=20$ grams of fat. If $p$ grams of protein and $c$ grams of carbohydrate contribute the remaining calories, then the total amount of energy from protein and carbohydrate is $180-20=160$ food calories, which is equal to $(4/9)(p+c)$ grams. Therefore, we have:

$$(4/9)(p+c)+20=f$$

Multiplying both sides by 9 and simplifying, we get:

$$4p+4c+180=9f$$

$$9f=4p+4c+180$$

$$f=\frac{4}{9}(p+c)+20$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 7:
Let's solve the problem using the given information. 

Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ be the energy per gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. Then we have:

$180 = E_p p + E_f f + E_c c$

Substituting the values from the table, we get:

$180 = 4p + 9f + 4c$

Solving for $f$, we get:

$9f = 180 - 4p - 4c$

$f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 8:
The granola bar contains $180$ food calories, so the total energy from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate is $180$ food calories. Using the values from the table, we can convert these food calories to kilojoules: $$180\text{ food calories}\cdot\frac{16.7\text{ kJ}}{1\text{ food calorie}}=3018\text{ kJ}.$$The energy from the protein is $16.7p$ kJ, the energy from the fat is $37.7f$ kJ, and the energy from the carbohydrate is $16.7c$ kJ. So we have the equation $$16.7p+37.7f+16.7c=3018.$$Dividing both sides by $1.7$, we get $$10p+22f+10c=1776.$$Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $$5p+11f+5c=888.$$Solving for $f$, we get $$11f=888-5p-5c=888-5(p+c)=888-5\cdot20=788,$$so $$f=\frac{788}{11}=20+\frac{8}{11}.$$Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get $f\approx 20.73$. 
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 9:
We are given that $180=4p+9f+4c$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}=\frac{20}{9}(9-\frac{4}{9}(p+c))=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(B)}$ $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.

Topic: Math
Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: At what price will the quantity of the product supplied to the market equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 90$
  B: $\$ 120$
  C: $\$ 133$
  D: $\$ 155$
Response 0:
To find the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, we need to find the price $P$ that satisfies the equation $S(P)=D(P)$. Substituting the given expressions for $S(P)$ and $D(P)$, we get:
$$\frac{1}{2}P+40=220-P$$
Solving for $P$, we get:
$$\frac{3}{2}P=180$$
$$P=120$$
Therefore, the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded is $\$ 120$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
We need to find the price $P$ at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity demanded. This means that $S(P)=D(P)$. Substituting the given functions, we get: $$\frac{1}{2} P+40=220-P.$$ Solving for $P$, we get $P=133$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we need to find the solution to the equation $S(P)=D(P)$. Substituting the given expressions for $S(P)$ and $D(P)$, we get $$\frac{1}{2}P+40=220-P.$$ Simplifying this equation gives $P=133$. 

Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
To find the equilibrium price, we need to find the value of $P$ that makes $S(P) = D(P)$.
$$S(P) = D(P)$$
$$\frac{1}{2}P + 40 = 220 - P$$
$$\frac{3}{2}P = 180$$
$$P = 120$$
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
We need to find the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, so we need to solve the equation $S(P) = D(P)$. Substituting the given expressions for $S$ and $D$, we have: 

$$\frac{1}{2} P+40 = 220-P$$

Solving this equation for $P$, we get:

$$\frac{3}{2} P = 180$$

$$P = \frac{360}{3} = 120$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
First, we need to set $S(P)=D(P)$ to find the equilibrium price:
$$S(P)=D(P)$$
$$\frac{1}{2} P+40=220-P$$
Solving for $P$, we get:
$$\frac{3}{2} P=180$$
$$P=120$$
Therefore, the equilibrium price is $\$120$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
To find the equilibrium price, we need to find the price $P$ that makes the quantity supplied equal to the quantity demanded, i.e., $S(P)=D(P)$. Substituting the given functions, we get:
$$\frac{1}{2}P+40=220-P.$$
Simplifying and solving for $P$, we get:
$$\frac{3}{2}P=180\Rightarrow P=120.$$
Therefore, the equilibrium price is $\$ 120$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
We need to find the equilibrium price, which is the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. So we need to solve the equation $S(P) = D(P)$, or $\frac{1}{2}P+40 = 220 - P$. Solving for $P$, we get $P = 133$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We want to find the price $P$ where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. This occurs when $S(P) = D(P)$. Substituting the expressions given in the problem, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2}P + 40 = 220 - P$$

Solving for $P$, we get:

$$\frac{3}{2}P = 180 \Rightarrow P = 120$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \$120}$.
Response 9:
To find the equilibrium price, we need to find the price $P$ such that the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. In other words, we need to find the value of $P$ that satisfies the equation $S(P)=D(P)$. Substituting the given expressions for $S(P)$ and $D(P)$, we get:
$$\frac{1}{2} P+40=220-P$$
Solving for $P$, we get $P=133$. Therefore, the equilibrium price is $\$ 133$.

Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 7
  C: 16
  D: 79
Response 0:
We have $\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$. Substituting $x=9$ gives $\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$. Adding 9 to both sides gives $\sqrt{k+2}=9$. Squaring both sides gives $k+2=81$. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives $k=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }16}$.
Response 1:
To solve the equation, we can isolate $k$ by adding $x$ to both sides of the equation and then squaring both sides: 

$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\ \sqrt{k+2}&=x \\ \sqrt{k+2}^2&=x^2 \\ k+2&=x^2 \\ k&=x^2-2 \end{aligned}$$

Plugging in $x=9$, we get:

$$k=9^2-2=79$$

Therefore, the answer is (D) 79.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
To solve the equation, we need to isolate $k$.
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{k+2}-x&=0\\
\sqrt{k+2}&=x\\
\sqrt{k+2}&=9\\
k+2&=81\\
k&=79
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Given that $\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$, and $x=9$. Substituting $x$ in the equation, we get:
$$\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$$
Solving for $k$, we have:
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{k+2}-9&=0\\
\sqrt{k+2}&=9\\
(k+2)&=81\\
k&=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }16}
\end{align*}
Response 4:
Squaring both sides, we get $k+2=x^2=81$. Therefore, $k=81-2=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 16}$.
Response 5:
We have: $$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$
$$\sqrt{k+2}=x$$
$$\sqrt{k+2}=9$$
Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:
$$k+2=81$$
$$k=79$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")

Action: Answer("C")  

Explanation:

$$\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$$
$$\sqrt{k+2}=9$$
Squaring both sides, we get:
$$k+2=81$$
$$k=79$$
Therefore, the answer is (C) 16.
Response 8:
Squaring both sides of $\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$, we have:

\begin{align*}
\left(\sqrt{k+2}-x\right)^2 &= 0^2 \\
k+2-2x\sqrt{k+2}+x^2 &= 0 \\
k+2 &= 2x\sqrt{k+2}-x^2 \\
\end{align*}

Substituting $x=9$ yields:

\begin{align*}
k+2 &= 2(9)\sqrt{k+2}-(9)^2 \\
k+2 &= 18\sqrt{k+2}-81 \\
k+83 &= 18\sqrt{k+2} \\
\left(k+83\right)^2 &= \left(18\sqrt{k+2}\right)^2 \\
k^2+166k+6889 &= 324k+324 \\
k^2-158k+6565 &= 0 \\
\left(k-1\right)\left(k-157\right) &= 0 \\
\end{align*}

Therefore, $k=1$ or $k=157$. Since we are looking for the value of $k$ and $k$ must be constant, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Squaring both sides of the equation, we get: 
$$\sqrt{k+2}=x=9$$

Question: $$2 a x-15=3(x+5)+5(x-1)$$In the equation above, $a$ is a constant. If no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, what is the value of $a$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 4
  D: 8
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")  
The equation can be simplified as $2ax-15=8x+10$. Then, $x=\frac{25}{2a-8}$. If no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, the denominator must be zero. Thus, $2a-8=0$, which gives $a=4$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
First, let's simplify the equation and see what we get: 

$$2ax-15 = 3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15 = 8x+10$$
$$(2a-8)x = 25$$
$$x = \frac{25}{2a-8}$$

Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, the denominator $2a-8$ must be equal to zero, because otherwise we would have a real solution for $x$. Therefore: 

$$2a-8 = 0$$
$$a = 4$$

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")  

We can start by simplifying the right-hand side of the equation: 

$$\begin{aligned} 3(x+5)+5(x-1)&=3x+15+5x-5 \\ &=8x+10 \end{aligned}$$

Then we can rewrite the original equation as: 

$$2ax - 15 = 8x + 10$$

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

$$(2a-8)x = 25$$

If there is no value of $x$ that satisfies the equation, then $2a-8$ must be nonzero (since otherwise we could solve for $x$ and find a solution). Therefore, we have: 

$$2a-8 \neq 0$$

Solving for $a$, we get: 

$$2a \neq 8 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \neq 4$$

Therefore, the answer is $a=2$, which is choice (B).
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B") 

To solve this equation, we need to simplify both sides and combine like terms. 

$$2ax-15=3(x+5)+5(x-1)$$
$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$(2a-8)x=25$$

Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, we know that $(2a-8) \neq 0$. Therefore, we can divide both sides by $(2a-8)$ to solve for $x$:

$$x=\frac{25}{2a-8}$$

Since there is no solution, we know that the denominator cannot equal 0. Therefore:

$$2a-8 \neq 0$$
$$2a \neq 8$$
$$a \neq 4$$

Therefore, the answer is $a=2$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B") 

To solve the equation, we first simplify the right side of the equation as follows:
$$2ax-15=3(x+5)+5(x-1)$$
$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$2ax-8x=25$$
$$2x(a-4)=25$$
Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, then $2x(a-4) \neq 0$ for any value of $x$. Thus, $a-4 \neq 0$, which implies $a \neq 4$. 

To determine the value of $a$, we can divide both sides of the equation $2x(a-4)=25$ by $2x$:
$$(a-4)=\frac{25}{2x}$$
Since $a \neq 4$, then $\frac{25}{2x} \neq 0$, which implies $x \neq 0$. Therefore, $\frac{25}{2x}$ can be any non-zero real number. 

However, we know that no value of $x$ satisfies the equation. This means that $\frac{25}{2x}$ cannot be any non-zero real number. The only way this can happen is if $2x=0$, which implies $x=0$. But we just said that $x \neq 0$. This is a contradiction, which means that our assumption that no value of $x$ satisfies the equation is false. Therefore, there must be a value of $x$ that satisfies the equation.

Since the answer cannot be "none of the above", we select the most likely answer, which is $a=2$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B") 

Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get: $$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$ Simplifying and rearranging terms: $$2ax-15=8x+10$$ $$2ax=8x+25$$ $$2ax-8x=25$$ $$x(2a-8)=25$$ Therefore, if no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, then $2a-8\neq 0$ and $a\neq 4$. So the value of $a$ must be either $1$, $2$, or $8$.

Question: The function $f$ is defined by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$. The graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following intervals contains the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-4<x<-3$
  B: $-3<x<1$
  C: $1<x<3$
  D: $3<x<4$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("-2") 

Explanation: 
The vertex of the parabola can be found by computing $x=-\dfrac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic function $f(x)$. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\dfrac{b}{2a}=-\dfrac{4}{2}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but rather the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$.
Response 1:
To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$, we can use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $ax^2+bx+c$ is the standard form of the quadratic function. In this case, $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$ and $b=4$. Therefore, $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Since $-4<x<-3$, we have $-4<-2<-3$ and so $x$ lies in interval $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -4<x<-3}$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("-2") 

Explanation: 
We can find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola by using the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic term and the linear term of the function, respectively. 
In this case, $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$ and $b=4$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ is $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2}=-2$. 
So the answer is not any of the given choices.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("-2")  

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$, we can use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$. In this case, $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$ (after simplifying $f(x)$). Thus, $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Since $-4<-2<1$, we can see that the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ is in the interval $-4<x<-3$ which is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("-2")  

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ can be found by using the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $ax^2+bx+c$ is the standard form of a quadratic function. In this case, $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$. Therefore, $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Since $-4<x<-3$, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("-2")  

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola, we use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where the quadratic function is in the form of $y=ax^2+bx+c$. In this case, $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$ and $b=4$. Therefore, $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Since $-4<-2<-3$, we choose answer choice $\textbf{(A)}$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Explanation:

Completing the square, we have:

$$f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$$
$$=x^2+4x+3$$
$$=(x^2+4x+4)-1+3$$
$$=(x+2)^2+2$$

Thus, the vertex of the parabola is at $(-2,2)$. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$. 

The interval that contains $-2$ is $-3<x<1$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("-2")  

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic function in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, we use the formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. 

For this problem, we first expand the given function to get $f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 3$. Then, we can see that $a=1$ and $b=4$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get $x = -\frac{4}{2(1)} = -2$. 

Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$, which is in the interval $-4 < x < -3$. 

Thus, the answer is (A).
Response 8:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola, we use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where the quadratic function is written in the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$. In this case, we can expand the given function to obtain $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. Thus, $a=1$ and $b=4$, and we have $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Since $-3<x<-1$, we choose answer $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ -3<x<1}$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("-2") 

The vertex of the parabola in the form $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$ is $(h,k)$. We can rewrite $f(x)$ as $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. Completing the square, we have $f(x)=(x+2)^2-1$, so the vertex occurs at $x=-2$. Thus, the answer is not in the given choices.

Topic: Math
Question: $$\frac{2}{3}(9 x-6)-4=9 x-6$$Based on the equation above, what is the value of $3 x-2$ ?
Choices:
  A: -4
  B: $-\frac{4}{5}$
  C: $-\frac{2}{3}$
  D: 4
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A") 

We can start solving the problem by first distributing $\frac{2}{3}$ to $9x-6$ as shown below: 

$$\frac{2}{3}(9 x-6)-4=9 x-6$$
$$6x - 4 - 4 = 9x - 6$$
$$6x - 8 = 9x - 6$$
$$-3x = 2$$
$$x = -\frac{2}{3}$$

We can then substitute the value of $x$ into $3x-2$ to get: 

$$3x - 2 = 3(-\frac{2}{3}) - 2 = -4$$

Therefore, the answer is A.

We start by distributing $\frac{2}{3}$ to $9x$ and $-6$. This gives us: $$6x-4=9x-6$$Next, we can simplify the equation by subtracting $6x$ from both sides: $$-4=3x-6$$Adding 6 to both sides, we get: $$2=3x$$Finally, we can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides by 3: $$\frac{2}{3}=x$$Now, we can find $3x-2$: $$3x-2=3\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)-2=2-2=0$$Therefore, the answer is (D) 4.

Topic: Math
Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
First, let's substitute $y=100$ into the equation:
$$0.10x+0.20(100)=0.18(x+100)$$
$$0.10x+20=0.18x+18$$
$$0.08x=2$$
$$x=25$$

Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }25}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
Response 2:
First, we need to substitute $y=100$ into the equation. Then, we can solve for $x$.
$$0.10 x+0.20 (100)=0.18(x+100)$$
$$0.10 x+20=0.18 x+18$$
$$0.08 x=2$$
$$x=25$$
Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 25}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")  
We can begin by substituting $y=100$ into the equation to get $$0.10 x+0.20 \cdot 100 = 0.18(x+100).$$Simplifying the equation gives $$0.10 x+20 = 0.18x+18.$$Solving for $x$ gives $$0.08x=2,$$so $$x=25.$$Thus, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }50}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
Response 5:
First, we can simplify the equation to $0.02x = 0.02y$. If Clayton uses $100$ milliliters of the $20 \%$ saline solution, then we have $x + y = 100$. We can substitute $x$ as $50y$, using the simplified equation. 
$$50y + y = 100$$
Solving for $y$, we get $y=2$, so $x=100-2=98$. Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 100}$.
Response 6:
First, we can simplify the given equation as follows:
$$0.10x+0.20y=0.18(x+y) \Rightarrow 10x+20y=18x+18y \Rightarrow 2x=2y \Rightarrow x=y$$
This means that Clayton must use an equal amount of the two solutions to create the desired $18 \%$ solution. Since he uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ solution, he must also use 100 milliliters of the $10 \%$ solution. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
$$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$
We are given that $y=100$. Substituting this into the equation above gives $$0.10x+0.20(100)=0.18(x+100).$$Simplifying this equation gives $0.02x=4$, so $x=200$. Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 100}$ milliliters of the $10\%$ saline solution.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
First, we will substitute $y=100$ into the equation and solve for $x$. 

$$0.10x+0.20(100)=0.18(x+100)$$
$$0.10x+20=0.18x+18$$
$$0.08x=2$$
$$x=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 25}$$

Thus, Clayton must use 25 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.

Choices:
  A: 1.2
  B: 15
  C: 48
  D: 72
Response 0:
To convert the percentage to decimal, we divide it by 100: $15 \% = 0.15$. 

Next, we need to find how many hours Lani spent in meetings: 

$8 \text{ hours} \times 0.15 = 1.2 \text{ hours}$ 

Finally, we convert hours to minutes: 

$1.2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ min/hour} = 72 \text{ minutes}$ 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
To solve the problem, we need to convert the percentage to hours and then to minutes. 

Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 

$15 \%$ of 8 hours can be found by multiplying $0.15$ by 8: 

$0.15 \times 8 = 1.2$ hours 

We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour: 

$1.2 \times 60 = 72$ minutes 

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.
Response 3:

Response 4:
To find out how many minutes Lani spent in meetings, we need to convert the percentage of her workday into hours, and then into minutes. 

Action: Answer("C") 

$15 \%$ of an 8-hour workday is: 

$0.15 \times 8 \text{ hours} = 1.2 \text{ hours}$ 

To convert hours into minutes, we multiply by 60: 

$1.2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}} = 72 \text{ minutes}$ 

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

Choices:
  A: 0.122
  B: 0.196
  C: 0.318
  D: 0.379
Response 0:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is given by the ratio of the number of orthopedic surgeons who indicated research to the total number of surgeons surveyed. That is $\frac{74}{607} \approx 0.122$. 

Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0.122}$.
Response 1:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research can be found by dividing the number of orthopedic surgeons who indicated research by the total number of surgeons surveyed. Thus, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("\(74/607 \approx 0.122\), so \textbf{(A)}\)").
Response 2:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is $\frac{74}{607}\approx 0.122$.  

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is approximately:

$\dfrac{\text{Number of orthopedic surgeons who indicated research as their major professional activity}}{\text{Total number of surgeons}} = \dfrac{74}{607} \approx \dfrac{1}{8} = 0.125$

The closest answer choice to this probability is A: 0.122. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is given by: $$\frac{\text{number of orthopedic surgeons whose indicated professional activity is research}}{\text{total number of surgeons}}=\frac{74}{607}$$ Since 74/607 is closest to 0.122, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is given by $\dfrac{74}{607}$. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by $37$, we get $\dfrac{2}{17} \approx 0.118$. The closest option is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0.122}$.
Response 6:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is given by the ratio of the number of orthopedic surgeons who indicated research as their major professional activity to the total number of surgeons which is: $\dfrac{74}{607} \approx 0.122$. 

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (A) 0.122. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Out of the 607 surgeons, 230 indicated that their major professional activity is research. Out of those 230, 74 are orthopedic surgeons.

The closest option is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 0.318}$.
Response 8:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is: $$\frac{\text{Number of orthopedic surgeons whose indicated professional activity is research}}{\text{Total number of surgeons}}=\frac{74}{607}\approx \frac{1}{8}\approx 0.125.$$ The closest option to the above value is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0.122}$.

The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
We can see that there exists a linear relationship between the purchase price and the monthly rental price. The general form of a linear equation is $y = mx+b$, where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the independent variable, $m$ is the slope, and $b$ is the y-intercept. In this case, the monthly rental price ($r$) is the dependent variable and the purchase price ($p$) is the independent variable, so we want an equation of the form $r(p) = mp + b$. 

To find the slope $m$, we can choose two points from the table and calculate the difference in rental price divided by the difference in purchase price. For example, using the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, we have:

$$m = \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5$$

So our equation is of the form $r(p) = 7.5p + b$. To find the y-intercept $b$, we can substitute one of the points and solve for $b$. Using the point $(70, 515)$, we have:

$$515 = 7.5(70) + b$$
$$b = -10$$

Therefore, the equation that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$ and the property's purchase price $p$ is:

$$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$$

Answer: Answer(D)
Response 1:
The slope of the linear function represents the amount of increase in monthly rent per thousand dollar increase in purchase price. We can find the slope of the line by finding the difference in rental price and dividing it by the difference in purchase price, for any two points on the line. For example, choosing the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, we have: 

$$\text{slope} = \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5$$

So the correct linear function is of the form $r(p) = 7.5p + b$. We can then find the y-intercept $b$ by plugging in any of the points and solving for $b$. For example, using $(128, 950)$: 

$$950 = 7.5(128) + b \implies b = -10$$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
We are given that the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Therefore, the function can be written in the form $r(p)=mp+b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. To find the equation of the line, we need to find the slope and y-intercept.

We can use any two of the five properties to find the slope. Let's choose the properties at Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive. The change in rental price is $1310-950=360$, and the corresponding change in purchase price is $176-128=48$. Therefore, the slope of the line is $m=\frac{360}{48}=7.5$.

To find the y-intercept, we can use any of the five properties. Let's use the property at Edgemont Street. When $p=70$, $r=515$. Therefore, $515=7.5(70)+b$, and solving for $b$ gives $b=-10$.

Therefore, the equation of the linear function is $r(p)=7.5p-10$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$.
Response 3:
We can use the formula for a linear function, which is $y = mx + b$, where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the independent variable, $m$ is the slope, and $b$ is the y-intercept. In this case, $r$ is the dependent variable and $p$ is the independent variable.

We can find the slope $m$ by using two points: $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$. 

$m = \frac{\text{change in } r}{\text{change in } p} = \frac{3365-950}{450-128} = \frac{2415}{322} \approx 7.5$

Now, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line:

$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

$r - 950 = 7.5(p - 128)$

$r = 7.5p - 870$

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
We can write the linear equation in slope-intercept form, $y=mx+b$, where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the independent variable, $m$ is the slope, and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We are given that the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, and the property's purchase price $p$ can be represented by a linear function. We can use the information from any of the given data points to find the slope and y-intercept of the linear function. Let's use the data point for Clearwater Lane, where $p=128$ and $r=950$ (we need to convert the purchase price to thousands of dollars). 

Using the point-slope form of a linear equation, we have:

$r-950=m(p-128)$

Substituting the values of $p$ and $r$ for Clearwater Lane, we get:

$950-950=m(128-128)$

$0=0$, which is true for any value of $m$. Therefore, we cannot determine the slope from this data point alone. 

Let's try another data point, such as Hamilton Circle, where $p=450$ and $r=3365$. Using the same method as before, we get:

$r-3365=m(p-450)$

$950-3365=m(128-450)$

$-2415=-322m$

$m=7.5$

Now that we have the slope, we can use any of the data points to find the y-intercept. Let's use the data point for Edgemont Street, where $p=70$ and $r=515$. Using the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, we have:

$r=mp+b$

$515=7.5(70)+b$

$b=-10$

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is:

$r(p)=7.5p-10$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
The slope-intercept form of a linear function is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. In this case, the monthly rental price $r$ is the $y$-value and the property's purchase price $p$ (in thousands of dollars) is the $x$-value. So we need to find the slope and $y$-intercept of the line that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$. 

To find the slope, we can use two points from the table. For example, using the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, we have:

slope $m=\dfrac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}=\dfrac{1310-950}{176-128}=\dfrac{360}{48}=7.5$

So the slope of the line is $7.5$. 

To find the $y$-intercept, we can use any point on the line. Using the point $(128, 950)$, we can solve for $b$ in the equation $950=7.5(128)+b$:

$b=950-7.5(128)=-10$

So the $y$-intercept is $-10$. 

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$ is:

$r(p)=7.5p-10$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ r(p)=7.5p-10}$
Response 6:
The slope of a linear function represents the rate of change between two variables. In this case, the monthly rental price, $r$, changes according to the purchase price, $p$. Thus, we need to find a function that represents this relationship and has the form $r(p)=mp+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. 

To find the slope, we can use two of the data points from the table. For example, using the points $(128,950)$ and $(176,1310)$, we have:

$$m=\frac{\text{change in }r}{\text{change in }p}=\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=\frac{360}{48}=7.5$$

So the slope of the function is $m=7.5$. 

To find the $y$-intercept, we can use one of the data points and the slope. For example, using the point $(70,515)$, we have:

$$515=7.5(70)+b \Rightarrow b=-10$$

So the $y$-intercept of the function is $b=-10$. 

Putting it all together, we have:

$$r(p)=7.5p-10$$

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("D").
Response 7:
The slope of the function represents the amount of increase in monthly rent per thousand dollars increase in the purchase price. We can find the slope by taking the difference in rental prices and dividing by the difference in purchase prices for any two properties. Let's choose the first and last properties: 

Slope = $\frac{3365 - 950}{450 - 128} = \frac{2415}{322} \approx 7.5$

So the linear function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is:

Action: Answer("D") $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 8:
We can use the two points (128, 950) and (450, 3365) from the table to find the slope of the line. The change in rental price is $3365-950 = 2415$ and the change in purchase price is $450-128 = 322$. Therefore, the slope of the line is $2415/322 = 7.5$. We can also see that the rental price is 10 dollars less than 7.5 times the purchase price, so the y-intercept is -10. Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price and property's purchase price is given by: 

$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate of increase in the monthly rental price per thousand dollars of purchase price. To find the slope, we can choose any two points from the table and use the slope formula: $m=\frac{r_2-r_1}{p_2-p_1}$.

Let's choose the points $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$.

$m=\frac{3365-950}{450-128}=\frac{2415}{322}\approx7.5$

So the slope is approximately 7.5. This eliminates choices A and C.

To find the vertical intercept, we can use one of the points and the slope. Let's use $(128, 950)$:

$r=mp+b$
$950=7.5(128)+b$
$b=-10$

So the function is $r(p)=7.5p-10$.

Topic: Math
Question: Nate walks 25 meters in 13.7 seconds. If he walks at this same rate, which of the following is closest to the distance he will walk in 4 minutes?
Choices:
  A: 150 meters
  B: 450 meters
  C: 700 meters
  D: 1,400 meters
Response 0:
To solve the problem, we need to find Nate's speed first. His speed is equal to distance divided by time. 

His speed is: 

25 meters / 13.7 seconds = 1.82481752 meters per second (rounded to 8 decimal places) 

Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time 

We know that Nate will walk for 4 minutes, which is 240 seconds. 

Therefore, his distance will be: 

1.82481752 meters/second x 240 seconds = 437.9562048 meters (rounded to 8 decimal places) 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
To solve this question, we can start with finding the speed of Nate in meters per second: 

`Speed = Distance / Time`

`25 meters / 13.7 seconds = 1.82 meters/second`

Then, we can use the speed to find the distance he will walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds):

`Distance = Speed x Time`

`1.82 meters/second x 240 seconds = 436.8 meters`

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get that the closest distance to Nate's walk in 4 minutes is 437 meters, which is closest to answer B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula:
distance = rate × time
where,
rate = distance ÷ time

Nate's rate is:
rate = 25 meters ÷ 13.7 seconds
rate ≈ 1.82 meters per second

To find the distance he will walk in 4 minutes, we need to convert 4 minutes to seconds:
4 minutes = 4 × 60 seconds = 240 seconds

Now we can use the formula:
distance = rate × time
distance ≈ 1.82 meters per second × 240 seconds
distance ≈ 436.8 meters

The closest answer choice is B: 450 meters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
To solve the problem, we can use the formula: Distance = Rate x Time

Nate's rate is equal to 25 meters / 13.7 seconds, which is approximately 1.82 meters per second.

To find the distance he will walk in 4 minutes, we convert 4 minutes to seconds: 4 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds.

Then, we use the formula: Distance = Rate x Time
Distance = 1.82 meters/second x 240 seconds = 436.8 meters

So the closest answer is Choice B: 450 meters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time

First, let's calculate Nate's rate:
rate = distance / time
rate = 25 meters / 13.7 seconds
rate ≈ 1.82 meters/second

Next, we need to find the distance Nate will walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds):
distance = rate x time
distance = 1.82 meters/second x 240 seconds
distance ≈ 436.8 meters

So the closest answer choice is B: 450 meters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
To solve this problem, we can start by finding Nate's speed in meters per second: 

`25 meters / 13.7 seconds ≈ 1.82 meters per second`

`1.82 meters per second × 240 seconds = 436.8 meters`

Rounding to the nearest hundred, we get:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
To calculate this we need to first find Nate's speed: 

speed = distance/time 

speed = 25/13.7 

speed ≈ 1.82 m/s 

To find the distance he will walk in 4 minutes, we can multiply his speed by the time: 

distance = speed x time 

distance = 1.82 x 240 (4 minutes = 240 seconds) 

distance ≈ 436 meters 

Therefore, the closest answer choice is B: 450 meters. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To solve the problem, we can use the unit rate: distance traveled per unit of time. 

First, let's find Nate's unit rate: 

25 meters in 13.7 seconds 

distance per unit of time = 25/13.7 ≈ 1.82 meters per second 

Now we can use this unit rate to find the distance he will walk in 4 minutes: 

4 minutes = 4 x 60 seconds = 240 seconds 

distance = unit rate x time 

distance = 1.82 meters/second x 240 seconds ≈ 436.8 meters 

So the closest answer is B: 450 meters.

  A: $\$ 2.60$
  B: $\$ 2.85$
  C: $\$ 2.95$
  D: $\$ 3.35$
Response 0:
The question is asking for the value of $b$ when $b=c$. Let's substitute $b$ and $c$ with their respective equations: $$2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$$Solving for $x$: $$0.15x=0.6$$$$x=4$$Now we can substitute $x=4$ into either equation to find the common value: $$b=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$$
Response 1:
We need to find the value of $x$ for which $b=c$. Substituting the given equations, we get $2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$, which simplifies to $0.15x=0.6$ or $x=4$. 

Now we can substitute this value of $x$ in either equation to find the price per pound of beef or chicken. Substituting in $b=2.35+0.25x$, we get $b=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \$2.85}$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \$2.85}$.
Response 2:
We need to find the value of $x$ such that $b=c$. Substituting the given equations for $b$ and $c$, we get $2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=6$. Substituting $x=6$ in either of the given equations for $b$ and $c$, we get $b=3.10$. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A") 

We set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$:
$$\begin{aligned} 2.35 + 0.25x &= 1.75 + 0.40x \\ 0.15x &= 0.6 \\ x &= 4 \end{aligned}$$

After $4$ weeks, the price per pound of beef was equal to the price per pound of chicken. Let's substitute $x=4$ into $b=2.35+0.25x$ to find the price per pound of beef:
$$b= 2.35 + 0.25(4) = 3.35$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \$2.60}$.
Response 4:
We need to solve the equation $b=c$ to determine the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken. Substituting the expressions for $b$ and $c$ in the equation, we get:

$$2.35+0.25 x = 1.75+0.40 x$$

Solving for $x$, we get $x=6$. Substituting $x=6$ in the expression for $b$, we get:

$$b=2.35+0.25\times 6=\$2.95$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$ 2.95}$.
Response 5:
We can set up the equation $b=c$ and solve for $x$ to find the week when the prices were equal, and then substitute that value of $x$ into either equation to find the price per pound. 

$$\begin{aligned} 2.35 + 0.25x &= 1.75 + 0.40x \\ 0.15x &= 0.60 \\ x &= 4 \end{aligned}$$

So the prices were equal 4 weeks after July 1st. Now we can substitute $x=4$ into either equation to find the price per pound.

$$\begin{aligned} b &= 2.35 + 0.25(4) = 2.35 + 1.00 = 3.35 \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } \$3.35}$.
Response 6:
We can start by setting $b=c$ and solving for $x$:
$$\begin{aligned} b &= c \\ 2.35+0.25 x &= 1.75+0.40 x \\ 0.15 x &= 0.60 \\ x &= 4 \end{aligned}$$
Now we can substitute $x=4$ into either equation to find the price per pound:
$$\begin{aligned} b &= 2.35+0.25\cdot 4 \\ &= 2.35+1 \\ &= \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95} \end{aligned}$$
Response 7:
We need to solve the equation $b=c$ to find the value of $x$ at which the prices were equal, and then substitute that value of $x$ into either equation to find the common price. So we have:

$$\begin{aligned} 2.35+0.25x &= 1.75+0.40x \\ 0.15x &= 0.60 \\ x &= 4 \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the common price per pound was:

$$b = 2.35+0.25(4) = 2.35+1.00 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$$

So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$.
Response 8:
We want to find the value of $x$ when $b = c$, so we set the equations equal and solve for $x$:\begin{align*}
2.35 + 0.25x &= 1.75 + 0.40x \\
0.15x &= 0.60 \\
x &= 4
\end{align*}Now we can substitute $x = 4$ into either equation to find the price per pound of beef and chicken (since they are equal at this point). Let's use $b$:\begin{align*}
b &= 2.35 + 0.25x \\
&= 2.35 + 0.25(4) \\
&= 3.35
\end{align*}Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \$3.35}$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")   
To find when the price per pound of beef equals the price per pound of chicken, we need to solve the equation $2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$. Simplifying gives $0.15x=0.6$, or $x=4$. Therefore, we need to find the price per pound of beef when $x=4$. Plugging $x=4$ into the equation for $b$ gives $b=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\$ 2.60}$.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Survey Results\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\hlineAnswer & Percent \\\hlineNever & $31.3 \%$ \\\hlineRarely & $24.3 \%$ \\\hlineOften & $13.5 \%$ \\\hlineAlways & $30.9 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the results of a survey in which tablet users were asked how often they would watch video advertisements in order to access streaming content for free. Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
Response 0:
Let $A$ represent the event that a user said "Always" and $N$ represent the event that a user said "Never". We want to find $P(A| \text{not } N)$.  
Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
$$P(A| \text{not } N) = \frac{P(\text{not } N|A)P(A)}{P(\text{not } N|A)P(A)+P(\text{not } N|R)P(R)+P(\text{not } N|O)P(O)+P(\text{not } N|N)P(N)}$$
We are given that $P(N)=0.313$ and we want to find $P(A|\text{not }N)$, so we need to find $P(R)$, $P(O)$, $P(N|A)$, $P(R|A)$, and $P(O|A)$.
From the table, we see that $P(R)=0.243$, $P(O)=0.135$, $P(A)=0.309$, $P(N)=0.313$, $P(N|A)=0$, $P(R|A)=0$, and $P(O|A)=0$ since someone who answered "Always" did not answer "Never", "Rarely", or "Often".  
Plugging in the values, we get:
\begin{align*}
P(A| \text{not } N) &= \frac{0 \times 0.309}{0 \times 0.309 + 0.243 \times P(R) + 0.135 \times P(O) + 0.687 \times 0.309} \\
&= \frac{0}{0 + 0.243P(R) + 0.135P(O) + 0.212883} \\
&= \frac{0}{0.243P(R) + 0.135P(O) + 0.212883}
\end{align*}
We know that $P(A| \text{not } N)$ is a probability, so it must be between 0 and 1. Therefore, the closest answer choice to $P(A| \text{not } N)$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 0.31}$.
Response 1:
Let $N$ be the event that the user answered "Never" and $A$ be the event that the user answered "Always." We want to find $P(A|N^c),$ the probability of answering "Always" given that the user did not answer "Never." By Bayes' Theorem, we have \begin{align*}
P(A|N^c)&=\frac{P(N^c|A)P(A)}{P(N^c)} \\
&=\frac{(1-P(N|A))P(A)}{1-P(N)} \\
&=\frac{(1-0.0.309)(0.309)}{1-0.313} \\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 0.38}.
\end{align*}
Response 2:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B),$ the probability that a tablet user answered "Always" given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." 

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have 

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}.$$ 

We know that $P(A) = 0.309$, $P(B) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687$, and $P(B|A) = 1,$ since a tablet user who answered "Always" did not answer "Never." Therefore, 

$$P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.45.$$ 

So the answer is (C) 0.45. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always," and let $N$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Never."
The probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never" is $1-P(N)=1-0.313=0.687.$
The probability that a tablet user answered "Always" given that the tablet user did not answer "Never" is $$P(A| \text{not }N)=\frac{P(A\cap \text{not }N)}{P(\text{not }N)}=\frac{0.309(0.687)}{0.687}\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}.$$
Response 4:
Let's define $P(A)$ as the probability of answering "Always," and $P(N)$ as the probability of answering "Never." We want to find $P(A|N')$, which is the probability of answering "Always," given that the user did not answer "Never." We can use Bayes' Theorem: $$P(A|N') = \frac{P(N'|A)P(A)}{P(N'|A)P(A)+P(N'|A')P(A')}$$ where $N'$ denotes "Not Never" and $A'$ denotes "Not Always." We can calculate the probabilities: $P(N'|A')=0.5$, $P(A)=0.309$, $P(A')=1-P(A)=0.691$, and $P(N'|A)=1-0.3=0.7$. Plugging in, we get: $$P(A|N') = \frac{(0.7)(0.309)}{(0.7)(0.309)+(0.5)(0.691)} \approx 0.383$$

Therefore, the closest choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 0.38}$.
Response 5:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A | B),$ which is the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." We can use Bayes' theorem: $$P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}.$$We can see from the table that $P(A) = 0.309.$ To find $P(B | A),$ we need to find the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never," given that the tablet user answered "Always." We can see from the table that $100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$ of tablet users did not answer "Never." Of those tablet users, $\frac{30.9 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.449$ answered "Always." Thus, $P(B | A) \approx 0.449.$ To find $P(B),$ we need to find the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We can see from the table that $100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$ of tablet users did not answer "Never." Of those tablet users, $$24.3 \% + 13.5 \% + 30.9 \% = 68.7 \%$$answered "Rarely," "Often," or "Always." Thus, $P(B) = 0.687.$ Putting it all together, we have $$P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \approx \frac{0.449 \cdot 0.309}{0.687} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 0.38}.$$
Response 6:
Let $N$ be the event that the user answered "Never" and $A$ be the event that the user answered "Always." We want to find $P(A|N^C).$ 

Using Bayes' theorem, we have \begin{align*}
P(A|N^C) &= \frac{P(N^C|A)P(A)}{P(N^C)} \\
&= \frac{P(N^C|A)P(A)}{P(N^C|A)P(A) + P(N^C|\overline{A})P(\overline{A})} \\
&= \frac{(0.309)(0.309)}{(0.309)(0.309) + (0.243 + 0.135)(1-0.309)} \\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}.
\end{align*}
Response 7:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always," and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B).$ 

By the complement rule, we have $P(B) = 1 - P(\text{Never}) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687.$

By the conditional probability formula, we have $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.$$ Since all tablet users fall into one of the four categories (Never, Rarely, Often, and Always), we know that $A \cap B$ consists of the tablet users who answered "Always" and did not answer "Never." From the table, we see that $30.9 \%$ of tablet users answered "Always," and $31.3 \%$ answered "Never." Therefore, $A \cap B$ consists of $30.9 \% - 31.3 \% = -0.4 \%$ of tablet users. Since probabilities cannot be negative, we must have $P(A \cap B) = 0.$ Therefore, $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{0}{0.687} = \boxed{0}\text{ (Choice E)}.$$
Response 8:
The probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never" can be calculated using conditional probability formula:$$ P(\text{Always} \mid \text{not Never}) = \frac{P(\text{Always} \cap \text{not Never})}{P(\text{not Never})} $$From the table, we know that $P(\text{Always}) = 0.309$ and $P(\text{Never}) = 0.313$. Therefore, $P(\text{not Never}) = 1 - P(\text{Never}) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687$. Further, $P(\text{Always} \cap \text{not Never}) = P(\text{Always}) - P(\text{Always} \cap \text{Never}) = 0.309 - 0 = 0.309$. Thus,$$ P(\text{Always} \mid \text{not Never}) = \frac{P(\text{Always} \cap \text{not Never})}{P(\text{not Never})} = \frac{0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.450 $$Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 0.45}$.
Response 9:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that the tablet user did not answer "Never". We want to find $P(A|B)$. By the definition of conditional probability, we have $$P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.$$ From the table, we see that $P(A) = 0.309$ and $P(B) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687$. To compute $P(A \cap B)$, note that if a tablet user didn't answer "Never," then they must have answered one of the other three choices. Thus, $B$ is the event that the user did not answer "Never" or "Rarely" or "Often". From the table, we see that $P(A \cap B)$ is the probability that a user answered "Always" and did not answer "Never" or "Rarely" or "Often", which is $0.309$. Thus, we have $$P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \dfrac{0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.449 \approx \boxed{\textbf{(C) }0.45}.$$

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")  

We can solve this system of equations by using the elimination method. If we multiply the first equation by $3$ and the second equation by $2$, we can eliminate $y$ and solve for $x$. 

$$\begin{aligned}& \begin{alignedat}{4} &\quad\ 2 x &- 3 y &&= -14 \\ &\underline{\quad\quad\quad\quad}\quad& 3 x &- 2 y &&= -6 \\ \end{alignedat} \\ \Rightarrow & \begin{alignedat}{4} 6 x &- 9 y &&= -42 \\ -6 x &+ 4 y &&= -12 \\ \end{alignedat} \\ \Rightarrow & \qquad\  -5 y &&= -30 \\ \Rightarrow & \qquad\ \ \ y &&= 6 \\ \end{aligned}$$

Substituting $y=6$ into either equation gives us $x=0$. Therefore, $x-y=-6$. 

Alternatively, we can solve for $x$ and $y$ in terms of each other and then substitute into $x-y$. 

$$\begin{aligned}& \begin{alignedat}{4} &\quad\ 2 x &- 3 y &&= -14 \\ &\underline{\quad\quad\quad\quad}\quad& 3 x &- 2 y &&= -6 \\ \end{alignedat} \\ \Rightarrow & \qquad\ \ x &&= \frac{3}{5} y + \frac{8}{5} \\ \end{aligned}$$

Substituting this expression for $x$ into $x-y$ gives us:

$$\begin{aligned}x-y &= \left(\frac{3}{5} y + \frac{8}{5} \right) - y \\ &= -\frac{2}{5} y + \frac{8}{5} \\ &= -\frac{2}{5} \cdot 6 + \frac{8}{5} \\ &= -\frac{4}{5} \\ &= -0.8\end{aligned}$$

Rounding to the nearest integer gives us $x-y=-1$. However, none of the answer choices match this value, so we select the closest choice, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 8}$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can solve the system of equations using elimination or substitution method. I will use the elimination method.

Multiplying the first equation by $3$ and the second equation by $2$, we have

$$\begin{aligned}&6x-9y=-42\\&6x-4y=-12\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get

$$5y=-30\Rightarrow y=-6$$

Substituting $y=-6$ into the first equation, we get

$$2x-3(-6)=-14\Rightarrow 2x=4\Rightarrow x=2$$

Therefore, $x-y=2-(-6)=8$, and the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can solve the system of equations using either substitution or elimination. Using substitution, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ from the first equation and substitute it into the second equation: 

$$\begin{aligned} 2x-3y&=-14\\ 2x&=3y-14\\ x&=\frac{3}{2}y-7 \end{aligned}$$

Substituting this expression for $x$ into the second equation gives:

$$\begin{aligned} 3x-2y&=-6\\ 3(\frac{3}{2}y-7)-2y&=-6\\ \frac{9}{2}y-21-2y&=-6\\ \frac{5}{2}y&=15\\ y&=6\\ \end{aligned}$$

Substituting $y=6$ into the first equation gives:

$$\begin{aligned} 2x-3y&=-14\\ 2x-3(6)&=-14\\ 2x&=-14+18\\ 2x&=4\\ x&=2\\ \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, $(x,y)=(2,6)$ is a solution, and $x-y=2-6=-4$. Thus, the answer is (C).
Response 3:
We can solve this system of equations by either substitution or elimination. Here, we will use elimination.

$$\begin{aligned}2x-3y&=-14 \\ 3x-2y&=-6 \end{aligned}$$

Multiplying the first equation by $3$ and the second equation by $-2$ gives:

$$\begin{aligned} 6x-9y&=-42 \\ -6x+4y&=12 \end{aligned}$$

Adding the two equations gives:

$$-5y=-30 \Rightarrow y=6$$

Substituting $y=6$ into either of the original equations gives:

$$2x-3(6)=-14 \Rightarrow x=2$$

Therefore, $(x,y)=(2,6)$ and $x-y=2-6=-4$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can solve the system of equations using elimination or substitution. I will use elimination in this case. 

To eliminate $y$, we can multiply the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $-3$:

$$\begin{aligned} &4x - 6y = -28 \\ &-9x +6y = 18 \end{aligned}$$

Adding the two equations, we get $-5x = -10$, which implies $x=2$. 

Substituting $x=2$ into the first equation, we get $2(2) - 3y = -14$, which implies $y=8$. 

Therefore, $x-y=2-8=-6$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")  

We can solve the system of equations using elimination or substitution. Using elimination, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to get:
$$\begin{aligned}&4x-6y=-28 \\&9x-6y=-18\end{aligned}$$
Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}&-5x=-10 \\&x=2\end{aligned}$$
Substituting $x=2$ into the second equation, we get:
$$3(2)-2y=-6 \Rightarrow y=6$$
Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")  

We can solve the system of equations using elimination. Multiplying the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}& 4 x-6 y=-28 \\& 9 x-6 y=-18\end{aligned}$$
Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $-5x=-10$, so $x=2$. Substituting $x=2$ into the second equation, we get $3(2)-2y=-6$, so $y=6$. Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")  

Solution: 

We can solve this system of equations using elimination or substitution. Below is one way to use elimination:

$$\begin{aligned} 2 x-3 y&=-14 &\quad &(1) \\ 3 x-2 y&=-6 &\quad &(2) \end{aligned}$$

If we multiply both sides of equation (1) by $3$ and both sides of equation (2) by $2$, we can eliminate $y$:

$$\begin{aligned} 6 x-9 y&=-42 &\quad &(1') \\ 6 x-4 y&=-12 &\quad &(2') \end{aligned}$$

Subtracting equation (2') from equation (1'), we get:

$$-5y=-30 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y=6$$

Substituting $y=6$ into equation (1), we get:

$$2x-3(6)=-14 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2x=8 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x=4$$

Therefore, $(x,y)=(4,6)$ and $x-y=4-6=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\,-4}$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")  

To solve this system of equations, we can use either substitution or elimination method. Using the elimination method, we can multiply the first equation by $-2$ and the second equation by $3$, then add both equations to eliminate $x$: 

$$-4x+6y=28$$

$$9x-6y=-18$$

Adding both equations, we get $5x=10$, so $x=2$. Substituting $x=2$ into the second equation, we get $3(2)-2y=-6$, which gives us $y=6$. Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$, so the answer is (C).
Response 9:
Action: Answer("D")  

To solve the system of equations, we can use elimination method. If we multiply the first equation by $-3$ and the second equation by $2$, we get the following equivalent system of equations:
$$\begin{aligned}& -6x+9y=42 \\& 6x-4y=-12\end{aligned}$$
Adding the two equations, we get $5y=30$, so $y=6$. Substituting $y=6$ into the first equation, we get $2x-3(6)=-14$, which gives $x=2$. Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$
Response 0:
We can use the equation of a line in slope-intercept form: $y = mx$, where $m$ is the slope of the line. If the line passes through the origin, then the $y$-intercept is $0$. Therefore, the equation of the line in this case is $y = \frac{1}{7} x$. 

To check which point lies on this line, we can substitute the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of each point into the equation of the line and see if the equation is true. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
To solve the problem, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line. The equation is: $y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $(x_0, y_0)$ is a point on the line. Since the line passes through the origin, we have $x_0 = 0$ and $y_0 = 0$. Substituting these values and the slope $m = \frac{1}{7}$, we get: $y - 0 = \frac{1}{7}(x - 0)$, which simplifies to $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.

Now we can check which of the given points satisfy this equation:
  - A: $(0,7)$ does not satisfy the equation, since $y = 7$ when $x = 0$.
  - B: $(1,7)$ does not satisfy the equation, since $y = \frac{1}{7}(1) = \frac{1}{7}$.
  - C: $(7,7)$ satisfies the equation, since $y = \frac{1}{7}(7) = 1$.
  - D: $(14,2)$ does not satisfy the equation, since $y = \frac{1}{7}(14) = 2$.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Slope-intercept form of a line is given by $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. Since the line passes through the origin, the y-intercept is 0. Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=\frac{1}{7}x$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
We can solve this problem using the point-slope form of the equation of a line. The equation of a line that passes through the point $(x_1, y_1)$ and has slope $m$ is given by:
$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$
In this problem, we are given that the line passes through the origin, which means that $(x_1, y_1) = (0,0)$. We are also given that the slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
$$y - 0 = \frac{1}{7}(x - 0)$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$y = \frac{1}{7}x$$
Now we can check which of the given points lie on this line by substituting their coordinates into the equation and seeing if the equation is true. Let's try each point:
  - A: $(0,7)$
    - $y = \frac{1}{7}x \Rightarrow 7 = \frac{1}{7}(0)$. This is not true, so point A does not lie on the line.
  - B: $(1,7)$
    - $y = \frac{1}{7}x \Rightarrow 7 = \frac{1}{7}(1)$. This is not true, so point B does not lie on the line.
  - C: $(7,7)$
    - $y = \frac{1}{7}x \Rightarrow 7 = \frac{1}{7}(7)$. This is true, so point C lies on the line.
  - D: $(14,2)$
    - $y = \frac{1}{7}x \Rightarrow 2 = \frac{1}{7}(14)$. This is true, so point D lies on the line.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 0:
Let's assume that Jennifer adds x cups of Super Grain cereal to $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. Since the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, we can write an equation as follows:

$240x + 210 = 270$

Solving for x, we get:

$x = \frac{3}{8}$

So, Jennifer adds $\frac{3}{8}$ cup of Super Grain cereal to $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. Therefore, the total amount of cereal in one cup of the mixture is:

$\frac{3}{8} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{8}$

Finally, to find the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture, we can subtract the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal from the total amount of cereal as follows:

$\frac{9}{8} - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{8}$

This is the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let's assume that the number of cups of Crunchy Grain cereal in the mixture is $x$, then the number of cups of Super Grain cereal in the mixture is $1-x$. 

The number of calories in $x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal is $210 \cdot \frac{4}{3} x = 280x$.
The number of calories in $(1-x)$ cups of Super Grain cereal is $240(1-x)$.

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is $280x+240(1-x)=240+40x$.

We know that the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270. 

Thus, we can set up an equation:

$240+40x=270$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x=\frac{1}{4}$

Therefore, the number of cups of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x=1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 

The Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, or 280 calories per cup. 

Thus, the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is $280(1-x)+240x=270$. 

Solving this equation yields $x=\frac{1}{3}$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 3:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal.
The total number of calories in the mixture is the sum of the number of calories from the Crunchy Grain cereal and the number of calories from the Super Grain cereal.
According to the information provided, one serving of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup. Thus, one cup of Crunchy Grain cereal provides:
$$\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}} = 280 \text{ calories}$$
Since Jennifer is using $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal, the number of calories from the Super Grain cereal is $240x$. Therefore, we can set up an equation to solve for $x$:
$$280 + 240x = 270$$
Solving for $x$, we get:
$$x = \frac{1}{4}$$
Therefore, Jennifer is using $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal in the mixture.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let's say Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal in the mixture. 
From the problem statement, we know that the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270. Since Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, then the number of calories in the portion of Crunchy Grain cereal that Jennifer uses is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}=280$ calories per cup. 
Therefore, the total number of calories in the mixture is:
$$\text{total calories} = 280(\text{C.G. cereal}) + 240(\text{S.G. cereal})$$
But we also know that the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, so we can set up the equation:
$$270 = 280(\text{C.G. cereal}) + 240x$$
Solving for $x$, we get:
$$x = \frac{270 - 280(\text{C.G. cereal})}{240}$$
We know that the portion of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, so substituting that in and simplifying, we get:
$$x = \frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$$
Therefore, Jennifer uses $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal in the mixture. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Let's say that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal and $y$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal to make one cup of the mixture. 

We know that the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270. We can set up an equation to represent this information:

$240x + 210y = 270$

We are trying to find the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture, which is $x$. We can solve for $x$ by isolating it on one side of the equation:

$240x = 270 - 210y$

$x = \frac{270 - 210y}{240}$

We also know that a serving size of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, so Jennifer is using $\frac{3}{4} - y$ cups of Super Grain cereal. We can substitute this expression for $x$ in the equation we just found:

$\frac{270 - 210y}{240} = \frac{3}{4} - y$

Multiplying both sides by 240 to eliminate the denominator:

$270 - 210y = 180 - 240y$

Solving for $y$:

$y = 9$

So Jennifer is using $\frac{3}{4} - 9 = \frac{-33}{4}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. This doesn't make sense, so we made an error in our calculations. 

Let's try another approach. We know that the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270. We can set up an equation to represent this information:

$240x + 210(1 - x) = 270$

Simplifying:

$30x = 60$

$x = 2$

So Jennifer is using 2 cups of Super Grain cereal and $\frac{1}{2}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal to make one cup of the mixture. The question asks for the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 6:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal and $(1 - x)$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture.
The number of calories in one cup of the mixture can be expressed as:
$240x + 210(1 - x) = 270$
Solving for $x$, we get:
$x = \frac{1}{6}$
So, Jennifer uses $\frac{1}{6}$ cups of Super Grain cereal and $\frac{5}{6}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } \frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 7:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal (in cups) in one cup of the mixture. The total amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x$ cups. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the number of calories from the Crunchy Grain cereal and the number of calories from the Super Grain cereal. 

Number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal: $\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup} \cdot \frac{210 \text{ calories}}{\text{cup}} \cdot (1-x) = \frac{315}{4}(1-x)$ calories

Number of calories from Super Grain cereal: $240 \text{ calories/cup} \cdot x = 240x$ calories

Total number of calories in one cup of the mixture: $\frac{315}{4}(1-x) + 240x = 270$

Solving for $x$:

\begin{align*}
\frac{315}{4}(1-x) + 240x &= 270 \\
\frac{315}{4} - \frac{315}{4}x + 240x &= 270 \\
\frac{261}{4}x &= \frac{15}{4} \\
x &= \frac{15}{261} \cdot 4 \\
x &= \frac{20}{87}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{8} \text{ cup}}$.
Response 8:
Let the amount of Super Grain cereal be $x$ cups. 

The amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x$ cups. 

From the information given in the problem, we can set up the following equation:

$240x + 210(1-x) = 270$

Simplifying the equation above, we get:

$30x = 60$

$x = 2$

Therefore, Jennifer needs $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{2}\ \text{cup}}$ of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture.
Response 9:
Let $x$ be the number of cups of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 

The total calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from one cup of Crunchy Grain cereal and the calories from $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. 

\begin{align*}
\text{Total calories} &= 210\text{ calories per }\frac{3}{4}\text{ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal} + 240\text{ calories per cup of Super Grain cereal} \cdot x \\
&= 280\text{ calories per cup of Crunchy Grain cereal} + 240\text{ calories per cup of Super Grain cereal} \cdot x \\
&= 270\text{ calories per cup of the mixture}.
\end{align*}

Solving this equation, we get:

\begin{align*}
280\text{ calories per cup of Crunchy Grain cereal} + 240\text{ calories per cup of Super Grain cereal} \cdot x &= 270\text{ calories per cup of the mixture} \\
\Rightarrow 240\text{ calories per cup of Super Grain cereal} \cdot x &= -10\text{ calories per cup of the mixture} \\
\Rightarrow x &= -\frac{1}{24} \operatorname{cup}.
\end{align*}

Since $x$ must be positive, we can conclude that there is \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}} of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture.

  B: $3 x+4 y=6$
  C: $2 x+4 y=6$
  D: $2 x+6 y=3$
Response 0:
We can see that the given equation is of the form $Ax+By=C$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{A}{B}$. The slope of a line perpendicular to this line is $\frac{B}{A}$. So, we need to find the equation whose slope is $\frac{B}{A}=\frac{3}{2}$. We can see that only the equation in choice $\textbf{(B)}$ has slope $\frac{4}{3}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
The given equation can be rewritten as $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. The slope of this equation is $\frac{2}{3}$. The slope of a line that is perpendicular to this line is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$, which is $-\frac{3}{2}$. Thus, we want an equation with slope $-\frac{3}{2}$.
We can rewrite the answer choices in slope-intercept form to determine which equation has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$.
A: $3x+2y=6$ can be rewritten as $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$, which is not perpendicular to the original line.
B: $3x+4y=6$ can be rewritten as $y=-\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{3}{4}$, which is not perpendicular to the original line.
C: $2x+4y=6$ can be rewritten as $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$, which is perpendicular to the original line.
D: $2x+6y=3$ can be rewritten as $y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$, which is not perpendicular to the original line.

Therefore, the answer is Answer("C").
Response 2:
To find the equation that is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find its slope. We can rearrange the equation to $y = \frac{2}{3}x + 2$. The slope of this equation is $\frac{2}{3}$. The equation that is perpendicular to this equation will have a slope which is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$, which is $-\frac{3}{2}$. The only equation that has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 3x+2y=6}$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
To solve this problem, we want to find an equation that is perpendicular to the given equation. Two lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is $-1$.

The given equation can be rewritten as $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. Therefore, its slope is $\frac{2}{3}$.

To find the slope of the line that is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to take the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. The negative reciprocal of a number is the negative of its reciprocal. The reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $\frac{3}{2}$, so the negative reciprocal is $-\frac{2}{3}$.

Now, we can check which of the given equations has a slope of $-\frac{2}{3}$:
- The slope of $3x+2y=6$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given equation.
- The slope of $3x+4y=6$ is $-\frac{3}{4}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given equation.
- The slope of $2x+4y=6$ is $-\frac{1}{2}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given equation.
- The slope of $2x+6y=3$ is $-\frac{1}{3}$, so it is perpendicular to the given equation.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
First, we need to find the slope of the given equation. We can rearrange the equation to get it in slope-intercept form:

\begin{align*}
-2x+3y &= 6\\
3y &= 2x + 6\\
y &= \frac{2}{3}x + 2
\end{align*}

The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$.

Recall that two lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is $-1$.

Let's find the slope of each of the answer choices:

A: $3x+2y=6 \implies 2y = -3x + 6 \implies y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{3}{2}$. The product of this slope and the slope of the given equation is $-\frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = -1$, so this could be the answer.

B: $3x+4y=6 \implies 4y = -3x + 6 \implies y = -\frac{3}{4}x + \frac{3}{2}$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{3}{4}$. The product of this slope and the slope of the given equation is $-\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = -\frac{1}{2}$, so this is not a perpendicular line.

C: $2x+4y=6 \implies 4y = -2x + 6 \implies y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{1}{2}$. The product of this slope and the slope of the given equation is $-\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = -\frac{1}{3}$, so this is not a perpendicular line.

D: $2x+6y=3 \implies 6y = -2x + 3 \implies y = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{2}$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{1}{3}$. The product of this slope and the slope of the given equation is $-\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = -\frac{2}{9}$, so this is not a perpendicular line.

The only answer choice whose slope has a product of $-1$ with the slope of the given equation is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }3x+2y=6}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
To find the slope of the given equation $-2x+3y=6$, we can rearrange it to get it into slope-intercept form:
$$3y=2x+6$$
$$y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$$
So the slope of the line is $\frac{2}{3}$.

Two lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is $-1$. Thus, we want to find the equation whose slope is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$, which is $-\frac{3}{2}$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To find an equation that is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find one that has a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given equation. 

The given equation, $-2x+3y=6$, can be rewritten in slope-intercept form as $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. Therefore, the slope of the given equation is $\frac{2}{3}$.

The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$.

The equation with a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$ can be written in the form $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+b$, where $b$ is a constant. 

To determine which answer choice is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find the one that can be written in the form $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+b$.

Checking each answer choice:
A: $3x+2y=6$ can be rewritten as $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$, so it is perpendicular to the given equation.
B: $3x+4y=6$ can be rewritten as $y=-\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{3}{2}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given equation.
C: $2x+4y=6$ can be rewritten as $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given equation.
D: $2x+6y=3$ can be rewritten as $y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given equation.

Therefore, the answer is (A) $3x+2y=6$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
We can see that the given equation can be rearranged to $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. A line perpendicular to this line should have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. So, its slope should be $-\frac{3}{2}$. Now, we can rewrite all the equations in slope-intercept form and see which one has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$:

A: $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+2$
B: $y=-\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{3}{2}$
C: $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+3$
D: $y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$

We see that the equation in choice $\textbf{(A)}$ has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$, so the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
To find the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line, we need to find the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. 

Given the equation $-2x+3y=6$, we can write it in slope-intercept form: 

$$y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$$

The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$. 

The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Now we need to find the equation of a line with slope $-\frac{3}{2}$ that is perpendicular to the given line. 

The equation $2x+6y=3$ can be simplified by dividing by 2: 

$$x+3y=\frac{3}{2}$$

We can write this equation in slope-intercept form: 

$$y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$$

The slope of this line is $-\frac{1}{3}$, which is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If $\frac{2 a}{b}=\frac{1}{2}$, what is the value of $\frac{b}{a} ?$
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4}$
  C: 2
  D: 4
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
We can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by $\frac{b}{2}$ to isolate $\frac{b}{a}.$ This gives us: 

$$
\begin{aligned} \frac{2 a}{b} &=\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{2 a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{2} &=\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{b}{2} \\ \frac{a}{1} &=\frac{b}{4} \end{aligned}
$$

Thus, $\frac{b}{a} = \boxed{4\textbf{ (D)}}.$
Response 2:
Solution: 

We can solve for $\frac{b}{a}$ by isolating it on one side of the equation. 

Starting with $\frac{2 a}{b}=\frac{1}{2},$ we can cross-multiply to get $4a = b.$ 

Then, we can divide both sides by $a$ to get $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{4a}{a} = 4$ 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 4}$
Response 3:
We can solve for $\frac{b}{a}$ by isolating it on one side of the equation. 

Multiplying both sides by $\frac{b}{2}$ gives us: 

$$\frac{2a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{b}{2}$$

Simplifying the left side: 

$$\frac{2a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{2} = a$$

Simplifying the right side: 

$$\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{b}{2} = \frac{b}{4}$$

So the equation becomes: 

$$a = \frac{b}{4}$$

To solve for $\frac{b}{a}$, we can take the reciprocal of both sides: 

$$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{4}{b}$$

Multiplying both sides by $b$ and then dividing by $a$ gives us: 

$$\frac{b}{a} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }4}$$
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Solution: 

We can start by cross multiplying the given equation:

$$\frac{2a}{b}=\frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow 2a = \frac{b}{2} = \frac{b}{2^1}$$

We can rewrite the right-hand side as $b \cdot 2^{-1}$, so we have:

$$2a = b \cdot 2^{-1}$$

Multiplying both sides by $2$ gives us:

$$4a = b$$

So, we have:

$$\frac{b}{a} = \frac{4a}{a} = 4$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 4}$.
Response 7:
Solution:
We can begin by cross-multiplying the given equation to get rid of the fraction:
\begin{align*}
\frac{2 a}{b} &=\frac{1}{2} \\
2a &= \frac{b}{2} \\
2a &= \frac{1}{2} b
\end{align*}
Multiplying both sides by $\frac{2}{b}$, we have:
\begin{align*}
\frac{2}{b} \cdot 2a &= \frac{2}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{2} b \\
\frac{4a}{b} &= 1 \\
\frac{b}{a} &= \boxed{4} \quad \text{(Answer D)}
\end{align*}

Question: A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 10,800$
  B: $\$ 16,200$
  C: $\$ 21,600$
  D: $\$ 29,700$
Response 0:
First, we can find the rate of depreciation per year by dividing the total depreciation by the number of years: 

$$\frac{\$ 32,400}{12 \text{ years}} = \$ 2,700 \text{ per year}$$

After 4 years, the equipment would have depreciated by: 

$$4 \text{ years} \cdot \$ 2,700 \text{ per year} = \$ 10,800 $$

Therefore, the current value of the equipment would be: 

$$ \$ 32,400 - \$10,800= \$ 21,600 $$

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Here, the rate of depreciation for the camera equipment is $r = \frac{\$ 32,400}{12\ \text{years}} = \$ 2,700/\text{year}$. After $t=4$ years, the equipment has lost a total of $4 \cdot \$ 2,700 = \$ 10,800$. The current value of the equipment is $\$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 = \$ 21,600$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Solution:
Since the equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, the depreciation per year is $\dfrac{\$32,400}{12}= \$2,700$. After 4 years, the equipment has depreciated by $4 \times \$2,700 = \$10,800$. So, the value of the camera equipment after 4 years is:

$\$ 32,400 - \$10,800 = \$21,600$

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's call the initial value of the camera equipment as $V_0$, and the value of the camera equipment after 4 years as $V_4$. 

We know that the equipment depreciates at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it has no value. This means that each year, the equipment will lose the same amount of value. Let's call this amount of value lost per year as $d$. 

Then, after 12 years, the equipment will have lost a total of $12d$ value, and we know that it will be worth nothing at that point. So, we can find $d$ by solving:

$V_0 - 12d = 0$

$12d = V_0$

$d = \frac{V_0}{12}$

After 4 years, the equipment will have lost $4d$ amount of value. So, we can find $V_4$ by subtracting this from the initial value:

$V_4 = V_0 - 4d = V_0 - \frac{4}{12}V_0 = \frac{2}{3}V_0$

Substituting $V_0 = \$ 32,400$, we get:

$V_4 = \frac{2}{3}(\$ 32,400) = \$ 21,600$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$ 21,600}$.
Response 5:
Let's first calculate the annual depreciation rate of the camera equipment. Since it has a lifetime of 12 years and depreciates at a constant rate, the annual depreciation rate is:

$$ \frac{\$ 32,400}{12 \text{ years}} = \$ 2,700\text{/year} $$

After 4 years, the equipment would have depreciated by $4 \times \$ 2,700 = \$ 10,800$.

So, the current worth of the camera equipment is:

$$ \$ 32,400 - \$10,800 = \$ 21,600 $$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Solution: 
The equipment decreases in value by the same amount each year. After 12 years, it has no value. So, the decreasing amount per year is $\frac{32400}{12}=2700$. After 4 years, the value of the equipment has decreased by $2700 \times 4 = 10800$. Therefore, the value of the camera equipment 4 years after it was purchased is $\$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 =  \boxed{\mathrm{(B)\ } \$16,200}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Depreciation means that the value of the equipment is decreasing at a constant rate each year. Therefore, after 12 years, the value of the equipment will be zero. Since the depreciation is constant, we can model the value of the equipment by a linear function. Let $V(t)$ be the value of the equipment $t$ years after it is purchased, where $t$ is a number between 0 and 12. Then $V(0) = 32,400$ and $V(12) = 0.$ Thus, the rate of depreciation is:
$$\frac{V(0) - V(12)}{12-0} = \frac{32,400 - 0}{12} = 2,700$$
So the value of the equipment $t$ years after it is purchased is given by:
$$V(t) = 32,400 - 2,700 t$$
To find the value of the equipment 4 years after it is purchased, we plug in $t=4$:
$$V(4) = 32,400 - 2,700(4) = 21,600$$
Therefore, the value of the equipment 4 years after it is purchased is $\$ 21,600.$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
We can solve this problem using simple linear depreciation. Every year the value decreases by the same amount. 

We know that after 12 years, the equipment is worth 0. So, the equipment will depreciate by $32,400/12 = 2700$ per year.

After 4 years, the value will be $32,400 - 4 \times 2700 = 21600$.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cylindrical can containing pieces of fruit is filled to the top with syrup before being sealed. The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. If $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, which of the following is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can?
Choices:
  A: $7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  B: $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  C: $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  D: $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 0:
Let's begin by finding the volume of the can. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the area of the base is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so we can solve for the radius, $r$:

\begin{align*}
A &= \pi r^2 \\
75 &= \pi r^2 \\
r^2 &= \frac{75}{\pi} \\
r &\approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{align*}

Now we can use the volume formula to find the volume of the can:

\begin{align*}
V &= \pi r^2 h \\
&= \pi (4.33)^2 (10) \\
&\approx 591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}
\end{align*}

We are told that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is used to fill the can to the top, so we can subtract that from the total volume of the can to find the volume of the fruit:

\begin{align*}
V_\text{fruit} &= V - 110 \\
&\approx 481 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the closest choice to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}~640\mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 1:
The volume of the syrup is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^3$. The volume of the cylinder is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \times 10 \mathrm{~cm} = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^3$. Therefore, the volume of the fruit inside the cylinder is $750 \mathrm{~cm}^3 - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^3 = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^3$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Let $V_f$ be the volume of the fruit in the can. Then, the volume of the syrup in the can is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = V - V_f$. 

The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius of the base is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Using the given height of $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, we can find the total volume of the can:

$V = \pi r^2 h = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Then, we can find the volume of the fruit:

$V_f = V - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 481 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Therefore, the answer is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}~640\text{ cm}^3}$.
Response 3:
The total volume of the fruit in the can is equal to the volume of syrup in the can subtracted from the total volume of the can.
The volume of syrup in the can is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
The volume of the can can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base of the cylinder and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.
The area of the base of the cylinder is given as $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, which means that the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.3 \mathrm{~cm}$ (rounded to one decimal place).
Therefore, the volume of the can is $\pi (\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}})^2 \times 10 \mathrm{~cm} \approx 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ (rounded to one decimal place).
Therefore, the volume of the fruit in the can is approximately $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's first calculate the volume of the cylindrical can:
$V = Bh = (75)(10) = 750 ~\mathrm{cm^3}$

The volume of the syrup that needs to be filled in the cylindrical can is $110 ~\mathrm{cm^3}$. Therefore, the remaining volume is the volume of the pieces of fruit:
$750 - 110 = 640 ~\mathrm{cm^3}$.

So, the closest volume to the total volume of the pieces of fruit inside the can is:

Action: Answer("C") $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylindrical can using the formula for the volume of a cylinder:

$V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h$

where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We know that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is:

$r = \sqrt{\frac{A_{\text{base}}}{\pi}} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$

The height of the cylinder is given as $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, so the volume of the cylinder is:

$V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}})^2 (10) \approx 235.62 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Since the syrup fills the can up to the top, the total volume of the pieces of fruit plus syrup is the same as the volume of the cylinder, which we just calculated as $235.62 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. The volume of syrup is given as $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, so the volume of the pieces of fruit is:

$V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} - V_{\text{syrup}} = 235.62 - 110 = 125.62 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$ (Note: this is the volume of the entire can, not just the fruit.)
Response 8:
Let $r$ be the radius of the base of the can. The volume of the can can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V_{\text{can}} = \pi r^2 h$. We know that $h=10\mathrm{~cm}$ and that the base of the cylinder has area $75\mathrm{~cm}^2$, so $\pi r^2 = 75\mathrm{~cm}^2$ and $r^2 = 25\mathrm{~cm}^2$. Therefore, $r=5\mathrm{~cm}$ and $V_{\text{can}} = \pi (5\mathrm{~cm})^2 (10\mathrm{~cm}) = 250\pi\mathrm{~cm}^3$. 

The volume of the syrup added to the can is $110\mathrm{~cm}^3$, so the total volume of the can with the fruit and syrup is $V_{\text{can}}+110\mathrm{~cm}^3$. To find the volume of the fruit, we can subtract the volume of the syrup from the total volume of the can: 

$$ V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{can}} + 110\mathrm{~cm}^3 - V_{\text{syrup}} $$

The volume of the syrup is equal to the product of the area of the base of the cylinder and the height of the syrup in the can: 

$$ V_{\text{syrup}} = \pi r^2 h_{\text{syrup}} $$

The height of the syrup can be found by subtracting the height of the fruit from the total height of the can: 

$$ h_{\text{syrup}} = h - h_{\text{fruit}} $$

We don't know the height of the fruit, but we can assume that the fruit fills the can to the top before syrup is added. Therefore, the height of the fruit is equal to the height of the can, which is $10\mathrm{~cm}$. 

Substituting these values, we get:

\begin{align*}
V_{\text{fruit}} &= V_{\text{can}} + 110\mathrm{~cm}^3 - V_{\text{syrup}} \\
&= 250\pi\mathrm{~cm}^3 + 110\mathrm{~cm}^3 - \pi r^2 h_{\text{syrup}} \\
&= 250\pi\mathrm{~cm}^3 + 110\mathrm{~cm}^3 - \pi r^2 (h-h_{\text{fruit}}) \\
&= 250\pi\mathrm{~cm}^3 + 110\mathrm{~cm}^3 - 75\pi\mathrm{~cm}^3 (10\mathrm{~cm}-10\mathrm{~cm}) \\
&= 360\mathrm{~cm}^3
\end{align*}

Therefore, the closest choice to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 185\mathrm{~cm}^3}$.
Response 9:
We can start by finding the volume of the can. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $\pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Next, we can find the volume of the fruit in the can by subtracting the volume of the syrup from the volume of the can. We are given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, so the volume of the fruit is approximately $591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 481 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Therefore, the closest answer choice to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If $2 w+4 t=14$ and $4 w+5 t=25$, what is the value of $2 w+3 t ?$
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 10
  C: 13
  D: 17
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")  

Here's the method to solve it:
Given, $2 w + 4 t =14 ..... (1)$ and $4 w + 5 t=25 ...... (2)$

Multiplying equation $(1)$ by 2, we get $4 w + 8 t=28 ..... (3)$

Subtracting equation $(2)$ from equation $(3)$, we get $t=3$

Substituting the value of $t$ in equation $(1)$, we get $w=2$

Therefore,  $2 w+3 t=2\times2+3\times3=13$
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ to get $-4w-8t=-28$, and then adding the resulting equation to the second equation $4w+5t=25$, eliminating the $w$ variable: $-3t=-3 \Rightarrow t=1$. Substituting this value into the first equation, we have $2w+4=14 \Rightarrow w=5$. Finally, we can calculate $2w+3t = 2(5)+3(1)=13$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve for $w$ and $t$ by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation to get $t=3$. Substituting back, we get $w=2$. Therefore, $2w+3t=2(2)+3(3)=4+9=13$. Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }13}$
Response 3:
We can solve for $w$ and $t$ by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation:
\[(-2)(2w+4t) + (4w+5t) = -4w - 8t + 4w + 5t = -3t = 11\]
Therefore, $t = -\frac{11}{3}$.
We can then substitute this value of $t$ into either of the original equations to solve for $w$. Let's use the first equation:
\[2w + 4\left(-\frac{11}{3}\right) = 14\]
\[2w = \frac{70}{3}\]
\[w = \frac{35}{3}\]
Finally, we can substitute these values into $2w + 3t$ to get:
\[2\left(\frac{35}{3}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{11}{3}\right) = \frac{70-33}{3} = \frac{37}{3}\]
Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above")

(Note: None of the answer choices is equal to the correct answer $\frac{37}{3}$)
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")  
Solution: 
We need to eliminate one of the variables. Multiplying the first equation by $-2$ gives $-4w-8t=-28$. Adding this to the second equation $4w+5t=25$ eliminates $w$, leaving $-3t=-3$, or $t=1$. Substituting this value into the first equation gives $2w+4=14$, or $w=5$. Finally, $2w+3t= 2(5)+3(1) = 13$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }13}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")  

Solution: 

We can manipulate the given equations to solve for $w$ and $t$ and then plug in their values into $2w + 3t$. 

We can first multiply the first equation by $-2$ and add to the second equation to eliminate $w$: 

\begin{align*}
(-2)(2w+4t)&=(-2)(14) \\
\Rightarrow -4w-8t &=-28 \\
\Rightarrow 4w+5t&=25 \\
\hline \\
\Rightarrow \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \, \, -3t &= -3 \\
\Rightarrow  \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \, \, t &= 1
\end{align*}

We can then plug $t=1$ into the first equation and solve for $w$: 

\begin{align*}
2w+4t&=14 \\
\Rightarrow 2w+4(1)&=14 \\
\Rightarrow 2w &= 10 \\
\Rightarrow w&=5
\end{align*}

Finally, we can plug in $w=5$ and $t=1$ into $2w + 3t$ to get:

$$2w + 3t = 2(5) + 3(1) = 10 + 3 = \boxed{13}$$
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ to get $-4w-8t=-28$, and then adding that to the second equation to get $4w+5t-(-4w-8t)=25-28$, which simplifies to $13t=-3$. Therefore, $t=-\frac{3}{13}$, and substituting that into the first equation gives $2w+4\left(-\frac{3}{13}\right)=14$, or $w=\frac{59}{26}$. Finally, $2w+3t=2\cdot\frac{59}{26}+3\cdot\left(-\frac{3}{13}\right)=\frac{118}{26}-\frac{18}{13}=\frac{26}{2}-\frac{36}{2}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\; 13}$
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $2$ and subtracting it from the second equation to eliminate $w:$

$(4w +5t) -2(2w+4t) = 25 -2(14)$

$4w +5t -4w -8t = -3$

$t = 3$

Substituting $t=3$ into the first equation gives $2w = 14 - 4t = 14 -12 = 2,$ so $w=1.$ Therefore:

$2w+3t = 2(1) +3(3) = \boxed{13}$
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve the system of linear equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ giving $-4w-8t=-28$. Adding this to the second equation gives $0w-3t=-3$, or $t=1$. Substituting this back into the first equation gives $2w+4 = 14$, so $w=5$. Finally, $2w+3t=2(5)+3(1) = 13$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C")  
Solution: We are given $2 w+4 t=14$ and $4 w+5 t=25$. We want to find $2 w+3 t$. Let's try to eliminate one of the variables from the equations. If we multiply the first equation by $-2$, we get $-4 w-8 t=-28$. Adding this equation to the second equation gives $-3 t=-3$, so $t=1$. Substituting $t=1$ into the first equation gives $2w+4(1)=14$, so $2w=10$ and $w=5$. Therefore, $2w+3t=2(5)+3(1)=13$. Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ 13}$.

Question: $$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$The equation above is true for all $x$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. What is the value of $a b$ ?
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 24
  D: 40
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")  
Solution:
Comparing both sides of the equation and using the distributive property, we have:
$$5ax^3 +(12-5b)x^2 +(12-4ab)x + 12 = 20x^3 - 9x^2 -2x +12$$
Equating the coefficients of like terms, we get the following system of equations:
\begin{align*}
5a &= 20 \implies a = 4 \\
12 - 5b &= -9 \implies b = 3 \\
12-4ab &= -2 \implies ab = \boxed{6}
\end{align*}
Response 2:
We can solve this by expanding the product on the left side of the equation and comparing the resulting polynomial to the polynomial on the right side. The constant term on the right side is 12, which tells us that the constant term on the left side is also 12. This means that $3\cdot 4 = 12$, so one of the factors in the left side must be $(3+ax)$. 

Expanding, we have:
$$(3+ax)(5x^2-bx+4) = 15x^2 + (4a-3b)x + 12$$

Comparing this to the right side of the original equation, we have:
\begin{align*}
4a-3b &= -2 \\
15 &= 20 \\
\end{align*}

The second equation is not true, which means there is no value of $a$ and $b$ that satisfies the original equation for all $x$. Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above". 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")  
Solution: We can solve this problem by expanding the left-hand side of the equation and then comparing the coefficients of like terms on both sides. $$\begin{aligned} (a x+3)(5 x^{2}-b x+4) &=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12 \\ 5 a x^{3}+15 a x^{2}-5 b x^{2}-15 a b x+20 x^{2}-4 a x+12 x-12 b &=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12 \end{aligned}$$Comparing the coefficients of like terms, we get the following system of equations: $$\begin{aligned} 5 a &=20 \\ -5 b+20 &= -9 \\ -4 a+12 &= -2 \\ -15 a b &= 0 \end{aligned}$$Solving this system, we get $a=4$, $b=-2$, and $ab=-8$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 18}.$
Response 4:
Expanding the left side of the equation, we have 

$$5a x^3 + (12-5ab) x^2 +(4b-2a) x + 12 = 20 x^3 - 9 x^2 - 2 x + 12.$$

Comparing the coefficients of like terms on both sides, we have

\begin{align*}
5a &= 20 &\Rightarrow\quad
a &= 4, \\
12-5ab &= -9 &\Rightarrow\quad
ab &= 3, \\
4b-2a &= -2 &\Rightarrow\quad
b &= \frac{a-1}{2}=\frac32.
\end{align*}

Therefore, $ab=4\cdot \frac32 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 24}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A") 

Expanding the left side of the equation we get:
$$5ax^3-ax^2b+20x^2+12ax-3bx-4a=20x^{3}-9x^{2}-2x+12$$
By matching the coefficients between the two sides, we can form a system of equations:
$$\begin{cases}5a=20\\-b a+12 a=-3\\20-4a-3b=-9\\ab=-4a\end{cases}$$
From the first equation we get that $a=4$
Plugging $a=4$ into the second equation we have
$$-b (4)+12(4)=-3$$
Solving we find $b=9$
Finally, substituting these values into the last equation we get $ab=4(9)=36$
Therefore the answer is A) 18.
Response 7:
First, we expand the left-hand side of the equation by distributing the binomial $(ax+3)$: 

$$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=5 a x^3 - (ab+15)x^2+(12-3ab)x+12$$

Now, we can equate the coefficients of the like terms with the corresponding coefficients on the right-hand side of the equation: 

\begin{align*}
5a &= 20 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = 4 \\
-(ab+15) &= -9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad ab = 6 \\
12-3ab &= -2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad ab = 4 \\
\end{align*}

Since we have two different equations for $ab$, the answer is the solution that satisfies both of them: 

$$ab = 6 \qquad \text{(from equation 2)}$$

Therefore, the answer is (A) 18. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
We can start by expanding the left side of the equation:
$$5a x^3+13a x^2+(12-5ab) x+12a = 20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$
Since the equation is true for all $x$, we can equate the coefficients of the same degree terms on both sides. From the coefficients of $x^3$, we get $5a=20$, which gives $a=4$. From the coefficients of $x^2$, we get $13a=-9$, which is not possible since $a$ is positive. Therefore, there are no solutions for $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the equation for all $x$.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $a$ & $3 a$ & $5 a$ \\\hline$y$ & 0 & $-a$ & $-2 a$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$ are shown in the table above, where $a$ is a constant. If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $x+2 y=a$
  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
Response 0:
Substituting $x=a$ gives $y=0$, and substituting $x=5a$ gives $y=-2a$. Thus the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $y = mx + b$ for some constants $m$ and $b$. Since the slope of the line is $\dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \dfrac{(-2a) - (0)}{5a - a} = -\frac{1}{2}$, the equation of the line is of the form $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+b$. Substituting the point $(5a, -2a)$, we get $-2a = -\frac{5}{2}a + b$, so $b = \frac{1}{2}a$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}a$, which rearranges to $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ x+2y=5a}$.
Response 1:
Since there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we know that we can write the equation for a line that relates $x$ and $y$. To start, notice that whenever $x$ increases by $a$, $y$ decreases by $a$. Therefore, the slope of the line is $\frac{-a}{a}=-1$. To find the $y$-intercept, plug in the point $(x,y)=(0,a)$. We get $y=(-1)(0)+a=a$. Therefore, the equation for the line is $y=-x+a$. Solving this equation for $x$, we get $x=a-y$. Substituting the expression for $y$ in terms of $a$ and $x$ into each answer choice, we find that only $\boxed{\textbf{(A)} \ x+2y=a}$ works.
Response 2:
We can use the table to create three distinct points $(x,y)$. Let's use $(a,0)$, $(3a,-a)$, and $(5a,-2a)$. 

We can see that the slope between $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$ is $\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-1$. Similarly, the slope between $(3a,-a)$ and $(5a,-2a)$ is $\frac{-2a-(-a)}{5a-3a}=-1$. Since the slope is constant between the points, this is a linear relationship. 

Using point-slope form, we can start with the point-slope formula $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$ and plug in any of the three points and the slope we found of $-1$. If we use $(a,0)$, we find $y-0=-1(x-a)\implies y=-x+a$. Rearranging, we get $x+y=a$, which matches $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ x+2y=a}$.
Response 3:
We can start off by calculating the slope of the lines between the pairs of points given in the table. From $(a, 0)$ to $(3a, -a)$, the slope is $\frac{-a - 0}{3a - a} = -1$. From $(3a, -a)$ to $(5a, -2a)$, the slope is $\frac{-2a - (-a)}{5a - 3a} = -1$. 

This tells us that there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, and the slope of this line is $-1$. We can then use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, using the point $(a,0)$:

$y - 0 = -1(x - a)$

$y = -x + a$

Simplifying, we get:

$x + y = a$

This matches with choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ x+2y=a}$.
Response 4:
Substitute each pair of values into $y=mx+b$ to solve for $m$ and $b$.
\begin{align*}
0&=3b\\
-a&=b\\
-2a&=-5b
\end{align*}
Thus, $b=0$ and $m=a/3$. The equation of the linear relationship is $y=\frac{a}{3} x$. Multiplying both sides by $3$ gives $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } x+2y=a}$.
Response 5:
Substituting the values from the table into the equation $ax+b=y$, we get: 
$$\begin{aligned} a\cdot0+b&=0\qquad\Rightarrow\quad b=0\\ a\cdot a + b&=-a\qquad\Rightarrow\quad b=- a\\ a\cdot 3a + b&=-2a\qquad\Rightarrow\quad b=-2a\\\ a\cdot 5a + b&=\text{?}\qquad\end{aligned}$$
Thus, $b=-2a$ and we have $25a+b=\text{?}$, so the relationship between $x$ and $y$ must be
$$\begin{aligned}(5a)+b=-2a\qquad\Rightarrow\quad b=-7a\end{aligned}$$
Substituting this value of $b$ back into the equation above, we get
$$2x-y=7a.$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$.
Response 6:
We can see that the slope of the line that passes through $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$ is $(\Delta y) / (\Delta x) = -a / (3a-a) = -a/2a = -1/2$. Therefore, its equation is $y-0=(-1/2)(x-a)$, or equivalently, $2x-y=2a$. On the other hand, the slope of the line that passes through $(3a,-a)$ and $(5a,-2a)$ is $(\Delta y) / (\Delta x) = (-2a + a) / (5a-3a) = -a/2a = -1$. Therefore, its equation is $y+a=(-1)(x-3a)$, or equivalently, $x+y=4a$. We can multiply this equation by $2$ to get $2x+2y=8a$ and then simplify it to obtain $2x-y=6a$. So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }2x-y=7a}$.
Response 7:
We can plug in the given values of $x$ and $y$ into a system of linear equations:
\begin{align*}
a &= 5a + 2(2a)\\
-a &= 3a + 2(2a)
\end{align*}
Simplifying both equations gives us $a = 10a$ and $-5a = 7a$, respectively. The only solution to these equations is $a=0$. Therefore, we need to find an equation that only holds when $a=0$. Testing each equation shows that only $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }x + 2y = a}$ is true when $a=0$.
Response 8:
Substituting the given values of $x$ and $y$ in the equation $ax+b = y$ for a linear equation, we get the following system of linear equations:
$$\begin{aligned} a+b &= 0, \\ 3a+b &= -a, \\ 5a+b &= -2a. \end{aligned}$$
Solving this system, we get $a=-1$ and $b=0$. Hence the equation is $x+2y = \boxed{0}.$

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
We can see that $y$ is equal to $0$ when $x=a$, $-a$ when $x=3a$, and $-2a$ when $x=5a$. So we can use two of these points to find the slope of the line: $$\text{slope}=\frac{-2a-(-a)}{5a-3a}=-\frac{a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}.$$ Next, we can use the point $(a,0)$ and the slope we just found using the point-slope form for the equation of a line: $$y-0=-\frac{1}{2}(x-a)\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad 2y=-x+3a\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad x+2y=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 5a}.$$

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
Response 0:
To solve this problem, we need to convert the amount in 2-decagram to milligrams. 

First, let's convert 2-decagram to grams: 

$$2\text{ decagrams} = 2 \cdot 10 \text{ grams} = 20 \text{ grams}$$ 

Then, let's convert 20 grams to milligrams: 

$$20 \text{ grams} = 20 \cdot 1,000 \text{ milligrams} = 20,000 \text{ milligrams}$$ 

Finally, since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, we can calculate the number of doses as follows: 

$$20,000 \text{ milligrams} \div 1 \text{ milligram/dose} = 20,000\text{ doses}$$ 

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{D) 20,000}.
Response 1:
1 decagram is equal to 10 grams. Therefore, 2 decagrams is equal to 20 grams. Since 1 gram is equal to 1000 milligrams, 20 grams is equal to 20,000 milligrams. Hence, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
1 decagram $= 10 \times 1000 $ milligrams $=10,000$ milligrams 

Therefore, 2-decagram $= 2 \times 10,000 = 20,000$ milligrams

Since there are 20,000 milligrams in a 2-decagram container and each dose is 1 milligram, there are 20,000 doses in one container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
$1$ decagram $= 10 \times 1$ gram = $10^4$ milligrams

$1$ container $= 2$ decagrams $= 2 \times 10^4$ milligrams

$2\times10^4$ milligrams $= 2\times10^4$ 1-milligram doses.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
From the given infromation, 1 decagram is equal to $10$ grams and 1,000 milligrams are equal to 1 gram. So, \begin{aligned} 1 \text{ decagram } &= 10 \cdot 1,000 \text{ milligrams } \\ &= 10,000 \text{ milligrams } \end{aligned}
Therefore, 2-decagram containers have $2 \times 10,000 = 20,000$ milligrams. 

Each dose is of 1 milligram, hence there are $\dfrac{20,000}{1}=20,000$ doses of this medicine in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
1 decagram = $10 \times 1000 =10^4$ milligrams.

So, 2-decagram $= 2\times 10^4$ milligrams.

And 1 dose is 1-milligram.

Therefore, there are $2\times 10^4 \div 1 = 20000$ doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
1 decagram is equal to 10 grams, therefore: $$2 \text{ decagram}=2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ grams}$$
Since 1 gram is equal to 1,000 milligrams, therefore: $$20 \text{ grams} = 20 \times 1000 = 20 000 \text{ milligrams}$$
Thus, there are 20,000 one-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.  

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
To solve the problem, we need to first convert 2 decagrams into milligrams. 

$1$ decagram $= 10$ grams $= 10,000$ milligrams 

Therefore, $2$ decagrams $= 2 \times 10,000 = 20,000$ milligrams. 

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in a gram, there are $20$ grams in a 2-decagram container. 

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in a gram, there are $20\times 1000=20,000$ milligrams in a 2-decagram container.

Since each dose is 1 milligram, we can fit $20,000$ doses in one 2-decagram container.

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
We know, $1$ decagram $= 10$ grams and $1,000$ milligrams $= 1$ gram. So 1 decagram $= 10,000$ milligrams.\\
Therefore, 2 decagram $= (2 \times 10,000)$ milligrams $= 20,000$ milligrams.\\
Each container has $20,000$ milligrams. And, $1$ milligram dose is required. So, there are $\frac{20,000}{1}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2,\!000}$ doses in one 2-decagram container.\\
Response 9:
One decagram is equal to $10$ grams and one 2-decagram container has a mass of:
$$2 \text{ decagrams} \times 10 \frac{\text{grams}}{\text{decagram}}=20\text{ grams}$$
Since $1,000$ milligrams is equal to $1$ gram, there are:
$$20\text{ grams} \times \frac{1,000\text{ mg}}{1\text{ gram}}=20,000\text{ mg}$$
Therefore, there are $\textbf{(D) }20,000$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Question: A psychologist set up an experiment to study the tendency of a person to select the first item when presented with a series of items. In the experiment, 300 people were presented with a set of five pictures arranged in random order. Each person was asked to choose the most appealing picture. Of the first 150 participants, 36 chose the first picture in the set. Among the remaining 150 participants, $p$ people chose the first picture in the set. If more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture in the set, which of the following inequalities best describes the possible values of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $p>0.20(300-36)$, where $p \leq 150$
  B: $p>0.20(300+36)$, where $p \leq 150$
  C: $p-36>0.20(300)$, where $p \leq 150$
  D: $p+36>0.20(300)$, where $p \leq 150$
Response 0:
Using the information given in the problem, we know that the number of people who chose the first picture out of the first 150 participants is 36, which is more than $20 \%$ of the total participants. This means that the number of people who chose the first picture out of the remaining 150 participants must also be more than $20 \%$ of the total participants in order for the overall percentage to be more than $20 \%$. 

Let $x$ be the number of people who chose the first picture out of the remaining 150 participants. Then the total number of people who chose the first picture is $36+x$, and the total number of participants is $300$. 

The percentage of people who chose the first picture is $\frac{36+x}{300}$. We know that this is more than $20 \%$, so we can write the inequality:

$$\frac{36+x}{300} > 0.20$$

Multiplying both sides by 300, we get:

$$36 + x > 60$$

Subtracting 36 from both sides, we get:

$$x > 24$$

Therefore, the best answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
To choose the most appealing picture, the probability that the first picture from the set is chosen is given by $P.$ We are given that $P>\frac{1}{5}.$ Out of the first $150$ people, $36$ chose the first picture and out of the remaining $150$ people, let $p$ people choose the first picture. Then, the total number of people who chose the first picture is $36+p.$ Finally, we are asked to find the possible values of $p.$

Out of the first $150$ people, the probability that a person will choose the first picture is $\frac{36}{150}=\frac{6}{25},$ whereas, out of the remaining $150$ people, the probability that a person will choose the first picture is $\frac{p}{150}.$ Thus, the probability that a person will choose the first picture is $\frac{36+p}{300}.$

From the given information, $\frac{36+p}{300}>\frac{1}{5}.$ Multiplying both sides by $300,$ we get $p+36>60.$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } p+36>0.20(300), \text{ where } p\leq 150}.$

Response 9:
To start, we can calculate the proportion of participants who chose the first picture in the set among the first 150 participants as $\frac{36}{150} = 0.24$. Since we are told that more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture, then we know that the total number of participants who chose the first picture must be at least $0.20 \times 300 = 60$. 

Let $q$ be the number of participants among the remaining 150 who chose the first picture. Then we have $p + q \geq 60$, where $p$ and $q$ are both integers. We are also given that $p \leq 150$ and $q \leq 150$. 

To maximize $p$, we should minimize $q$. The least possible value of $q$ would occur if all 150 participants who did not belong to the first group of 150 participants chose the first picture. In this case, $q=150$ and $p \geq 60-150 = -90$, which violates the given condition that $p$ is a positive integer.

The next least possible value of $q$ would occur if exactly 1 person among the remaining 150 participants chose the first picture. In this case, $q=1$ and $p \geq 60 - q = 59$.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ passes through the origin. Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 4
  C: 8
  D: 16
Response 0:
To find the answer, we need to use the fact that the line passes through the origin. This means that the $y$-intercept is 0.
The equation of the line is:
$$\frac{y-32}{x-k}=\frac{k-32}{2-k}$$
We can simplify this equation to:
$$y-32=\frac{k-32}{2-k}(x-k)$$
Since the line passes through the origin, this equation becomes:
$$y=\frac{k-32}{2-k}x$$
Since the $y$-intercept is 0, we must have:
$$0=\frac{k-32}{2-k}(0-k)$$
Simplifying this equation yields:
$$k^2-32k=0$$
This equation factors as $k(k-32)=0$, so the possible values of $k$ are 0 and 32. However, if $k=32$, the line is vertical and therefore cannot pass through the origin. Thus, the only possible value of $k$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0}$.
Response 1:
If the line passes through the origin, then both points must be on the line $y=kx$. So,  $\frac{32-k}{k-2}=k$. Simplifying this yields $k^2-34k+64=0$, which gives $(k-2)(k-32) = 0$. Therefore, $k=2$ or $k=32$. Hence, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
To find the equation of the line, we can use the slope-intercept form:
$y = mx + b$
where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.

We know that the line passes through $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$. Using slope formula, we get
$m = \dfrac{32-k}{k-2}$
Since the line passes through the origin $(0,0)$, we know that $b=0$. So the equation of the line is
$y = \dfrac{32-k}{k-2} x$

Now, if this line passes through the origin, then we can substitute $x=0$ and $y=0$ and solve for $k$:
$0 = \dfrac{32-k}{k-2} \cdot 0$
$0 = 32-k$
$k = 32$

Therefore, the answer is (None of the Above).
Response 3:
We have two points on the line, $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$. Since the line passes through the origin, the third point on the line $(0,0)$ must satisfy the equation of the line. That is, the slope between $(0,0)$ and $(2,k)$ must equal the slope between $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$:
$$\frac{k-0}{2-0} = \frac{32-k}{k-2}$$
Multiplying both sides by $(k-2)$ and simplifying gives:
$$k^2 - 34k + 64 = 0$$
Factoring the quadratic gives:
$$(k-2)(k-32) = 0$$
So the possible values of $k$ are $2$ and $32$. However, if $k=2$, then the point $(k,32) = (2,32)$ does not lie on the line connecting $(2,k)$ and $(0,0)$, so $k$ must be $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
We know that the line passes through the origin, $(0,0)$, so we can set up the equation of the line as follows: 

$\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{k-2}{0-k}$

Simplifying, we get: 
$\frac{32}{k}=\frac{k-2}{k}$

Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get: 
$32=k-2$

Adding 2 to both sides: 
$k=34$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We know that the line passes through the origin, so the coordinates $(0, 0)$ must be on the line. The line passes through the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$, so the slope of the line is $\frac{32 - k}{k - 2}$. Since the line passes through the origin, we also know that the slope of the line is $\frac{k}{2-k}$.

Equating these slopes and solving for $k$, we get:

$$\frac{32-k}{k-2} = \frac{k}{2-k}$$

$$\Rightarrow (32 - k)(2 - k) = k(k - 2)$$

$$\Rightarrow 64 - 98k + 3k^2 = 0$$

$$\Rightarrow 3k^2 - 98k + 64 = 0$$

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we get:

$$k = \frac{98 \pm \sqrt{98^2 - 4\cdot3\cdot64}}{2\cdot3}$$

$$k = \frac{98 \pm \sqrt{8836}}{6}$$

$$k = \frac{98 \pm 94}{6}$$

So, $k = \frac{192}{6} = 32$ or $k = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$. 

Out of these two options, only $k = 32$ is given among the answer choices. So:

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If 50 one-cent coins were stacked on top of each other in a column, the column would be approximately $3 \frac{7}{8}$ inches tall. At this rate, which of the following is closest to the number of one-cent coins it would take to make an 8-inch-tall column?
Choices:
  A: 75
  B: 100
  C: 200
  D: 390
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To solve the problem we can set a proportion: $\frac{50 \text{ coins}}{3 \frac{7}{8} \text{ inches}} = \frac{x \text{ coins}}{8 \text{ inches}}$. We can then cross-multiply to get $50 \cdot 8 = 3 \frac{7}{8} \cdot x$ which simplifies to $400 = \frac{31}{8} x$. Solving for $x$ we get $x \approx 103.22$.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let us find the height(h) of a single one-cent coin using the given data: 

$50$ coins have a height = $3\frac{7}{8}$ inches 

Therefore, 
$1$ coin will have a height = $\frac{3 \frac{7}{8}}{50}$ inches [Divide the height by 50 to get height of 1 coin]  
$\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;$ = $\frac{31}{8*50}$ inches 

To find the number of coins to make an 8-inch-tall column, we need to divide 8 inches by the height we just calculated: 

Number of coins = $\frac{8\text{ inches}}{\frac{31}{8*50}\text{ inches}}$
  
$\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;$ = $\frac{8*50}{31}$ 

$\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;$ = $129.03$

Thus, the closest answer is 100 $\implies$ (B)

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Percent of Residents Who Earned a Bachelor's Degree or Higher\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hlineState & Percent of residents \\\hlineState A & $21.9 \%$ \\\hlineState B & $27.9 \%$ \\\hlineState C & $25.9 \%$ \\\hlineState D & $19.5 \%$ \\\hlineState E & $30.1 \%$ \\\hlineState F & $36.4 \%$ \\\hlineState G & $35.5 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}A survey was given to residents of all 50 states asking if they had earned a bachelor's degree or higher.The results from 7 of the states are given in the table above. The median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for all 50 states was $26.95 \%$. What is the difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states?
Choices:
  A: $0.05 \%$
  B: $0.95 \%$
  C: $1.22 \%$
  D: $7.45 \%$
Response 0:
The given table is already sorted in an increasing order of percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher. The median is the middle value of the distribution. 
- When we have an odd number of values, the median is the middle number.
- When we have an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

For the 7 states in the table, there is an odd number of values, so the median is the middle value, which is State C with $25.9 \%$. 

The difference between the median for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $26.95\% - 25.9\% = 1.05\%$.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B") $0.95 \%$
Response 1:
First, let's write the given percentages in order from smallest to largest: $$19.5 \% < 21.9 \% < 25.9 \% < 27.9 \% < 30.1 \% < 35.5 \% < 36.4 \%.$$The median percent is the middle value, which is also $25 \%$ of the way from the smallest value to the largest value. We have: $$0.25 \cdot 7 = 1.75,$$so the median value comes from the third and fourth values in the list. Their average is $\frac{25.9 \% + 27.9 \%}{2} = 26.9 \%$. The difference between this and the median for all 50 states is $|26.95 \% - 26.9 \%| = 0.05 \%$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0.05 \%}$.
Response 2:
The median is the middle value when all the values are arranged in order. Given the percent of residents for each of the states in the table above, we arrange them in order, from lowest to highest as follows: $$19.5,21.9,25.9,27.9,30.1,35.5,36.4.$$Since the number of states ($7$) is odd, the median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these $7$ states and the median for all $50$ states is $27.9-26.95=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 3:
First, we arrange the percent of residents in order from least to greatest: \[19.5, 21.9, 25.9, 27.9, 30.1, 35.5, 36.4.\]The median of these 7 states is $27.9 \%$.Since the median for the 50 states is $26.95 \%$, the difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $27.9 - 26.95 = 0.95 \%$.  

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$
Response 4:
The median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for all 50 states was $26.95 \%$. To find the median of these 7 states, we need to order the data from least to greatest:

$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$

The median is the middle number or the average of the middle two numbers. Since we have seven numbers, the middle number is the fourth ($27.9 \%$). Hence, the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states is $27.9 \%$. The difference between these two medians is:

$|26.95 \% - 27.9 \%| = 0.95 \%$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 5:
First, we need to order the percentages from least to greatest: 

State D: 19.5%
State A: 21.9%
State C: 25.9%
State B: 27.9%
State E: 30.1%
State G: 35.5%
State F: 36.4%

The median percent is the middle value when the percentages are ordered from least to greatest. Since we have an odd number of values, the median percent is the fourth value, which is 27.9%. 

The difference between the median percent of these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is:

$|26.95-27.9| = 0.95 \%$ 

So the answer is (B) $0.95 \%$.
Response 6:
First, we need to order the data from least to greatest: 

\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hlineState & Percent of residents \\\hlineState D & $19.5 \%$ \\\hlineState A & $21.9 \%$ \\\hlineState C & $25.9 \%$ \\\hlineState B & $27.9 \%$ \\\hlineState E & $30.1 \%$ \\\hlineState G & $35.5 \%$ \\\hlineState F & $36.4 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}

We can see that the median value is State C with a value of $25.9 \%$. The difference between the median of these 7 states and the median of all 50 states is:

$|26.95-25.9|\% = 1.05\%$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 7:
First, we need to arrange the $7$ states' percentages in order from least to greatest: $$19.5 \%,21.9 \%,25.9 \%,27.9 \%,30.1 \%,35.5 \%,36.4 \%$$ We can see that the median is $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median for these $7$ states and the median for all $50$ states is $26.95-27.9=-0.95$. This is equivalent to $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 0.95 \%}$.
Response 8:
We first need to arrange the percents in order, so that we can determine the median. This gives us:$$19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%.$$The median of this data set is $27.9 \%$, which is given to us as the median of all $50$ states. Therefore the difference is $0\% - 27.9 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \% }$.
Response 9:
The median of the 7 states is the middle value in the sorted list of percents. The percents from least to greatest are: $19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, and $36.4 \%$. The median of these 7 states is $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median percent of these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}Year & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Subscriptions } \\ \text { sold }\end{array}$ \\\hline2012 & 5,600 \\2013 & 5,880 \\\end{tabular}\end{center}The manager of an online news service received the report above on the number of subscriptions sold by the service. The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can start by finding the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: 

$$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \cdot 100 \approx 5\%$$ 

Let $x$ represent the number of subscriptions sold in 2013. If the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is 5%, then the number of subscriptions sold in 2012 is approximately 95% of $x$: 

$$0.95x = 5600 \Rightarrow x \approx 5894$$ 

We can now estimate the percent increase from 2013 to 2014: since the manager estimated that this increase would be half of the increase from 2012 to 2013, we can assume that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is approximately 2.5%. Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is approximately: 

$$5894 \cdot 1.025 \approx 6044 \approx \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6,440}$$
Response 1:
Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Since the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is half of the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, the number of subscriptions sold increased by $\frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600}=\frac{1}{50}$ from 2012 to 2013 and by $\frac{2}{50}=\frac{1}{25}$ from 2013 to 2014. So, $$\frac{1/25}{1/50}=\frac{x-5,880}{5,880-5,600}.$$ Solving for $x$, we get $x=6,\!027$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(B)}\ 6,\!027$.
Response 2:
We can start by finding the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 and the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\approx 0.05,$ or $5\%.$ Let $x$ represent the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, so the expected percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $2x.$ Then, the expected percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is $5\%+2x.$

If $n$ represents the number of subscriptions sold in 2013, then the manager expected the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 to be approximately $(1+0.05)(1+x)n.$ We want this expression to be equal to $(1+0.05+0.05x)5880,$ which is the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 using the given percent increase. Setting the two expressions equal, we have \begin{align*}
(1+0.05)(1+x)n&=(1+0.05+0.05x)5880 \\
1.05n(1+x)&=1.05\cdot 5880 + 0.05\cdot 5880 x \\
n(1+x)&=5600+56x .
\end{align*}We know that $n=5880,$ so we can substitute and solve for $x.$ We get $5880(1+x)=5600+56x,$ which simplifies to $28x=280$ or $x=10.$ Therefore, the expected percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $10\%,$ which means the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is approximately $(1.05)(1.1)(5880)\approx\boxed{\textbf{(C) }6440}.$
Response 3:
DIRECTIONS: 

Let $P$ be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, and let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013. Then $1.02P$ is the percent increase from 2012 to 2013, so the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $(1.02P)(1.02)(x)$. 

We have $x=5880$ and $1.02P=2(1.02P/2)$, so $(1.02)P/2=0.02$, which implies $P=0.039$. Thus the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $(1.02)(1.039)(5880)=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 6,027}$.
Response 4:
Based on the given information, we do not have the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 directly. Let us assume that the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $x$. 

We have been given that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $P_1$, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $P_2$, and $P_2 = 2P_1$. 

We have:

$$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} = P_1 \implies P_1 = 0.05$$

$$P_2 = 2P_1 = 0.1$$ 

Therefore, we can say that:

$$\frac{x-5880}{5880} = 0.1 \implies x = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }6468}$$

Therefore, the manager expected that 6,468 subscriptions would be sold in 2014.
Response 5:
First, we need to find the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Let's represent the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 as $x$. Then, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 can be written as $\frac{x-5880}{5880}$. 

Next, we need to find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. This can be written as $\frac{5880-5600}{5600}$. 

According to the problem, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is half the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, so we can write: 

$$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} = 2\left(\frac{x-5880}{5880}\right)$$ 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

$$x = 6468.$$ 

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(D) }6,\!468$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's calculate the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 and from 2013 to 2014 first. 

The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is: 

$ \frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% = 5\% $

Let's call the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 "x". 

According to the problem, we know: 

$ 2\times 5\% = 10\% = x\% $

So, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is 10%. 

If we start with 5,880 subscriptions from 2013, we can find out how many subscriptions are expected to be sold in 2014: 

$ 5,880 + 10\%\times 5,880 = 6,468 $

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D") 
Response 7:
We are given that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Let $x$ be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $2x$. 

Let $a$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 and $b$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then we have: 

\begin{align*}
b &= a + ax \\
&= a(1+x).
\end{align*}

We can also express the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 in terms of the number of subscriptions sold in 2012: 

\begin{align*}
b &= 5,880(1+2x)^2 \\
&= 5,880(1+4x+4x^2).
\end{align*}

Setting these two expressions for $b$ equal to each other, we have: 

\begin{align*}
a(1+x) &= 5,880(1+4x+4x^2) \\
a+ax &= 5,880(4x^2+4x+1) \\
a+ax &= 5,880(2x+1)^2 \\
a(1+x) &= 5,880(2x+1)^2.
\end{align*}

We want to find $b$, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Using the expression we found earlier for $b$ in terms of $a$ and $x$, we have: 

\begin{align*}
b &= a(1+x) \\
&= 5,880(2x+1)^2 \\
&= 5,880(2(\frac{280}{5880})+1)^2 \\
&= 6,027.
\end{align*}

Therefore, the manager expected 6,027 subscriptions to be sold in 2014. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
First, we need to find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. The difference in subscriptions sold is $5,880 - 5,600 = 280.$ The percent increase is $\frac{280}{5600} \cdot 100\% = 5\%.$ 

Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013. The number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $x(1+2\cdot 0.05)=1.1x.$ Thus, we need to find $1.1x.$

We know that $x=5,880.$ Substituting yields $1.1(5,880) = 6,468.$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }6,468}.$
Response 9:
First, we need to calculate the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: 
\begin{align*}
\frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600}\cdot 100\% &\approx 5\%
\end{align*}
Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is:
\begin{align*}
\frac{x-5,880}{5,880}\cdot 100\%
\end{align*}
According to the problem, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. So we have:

\begin{align*}5\% &= 2 \times \frac{x-5,880}{5,880}\cdot 100\%\\ 0.025 &= \frac{x-5,880}{5,880} \\ x &= 5,880(1+0.025)\\ x &\approx 6,027\end{align*}

Therefore, the manager expected 6,027 subscriptions to be sold in 2014.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A customer paid $\$ 53.00$ for a jacket after a 6 percent sales tax was added. What was the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 47.60$
  B: $\$ 50.00$
  C: $\$ 52.60$
  D: $\$ 52.84$
Response 0:
Solution: 

Let the price of the jacket before the sales tax be $x$ dollars.

Then, the total amount paid by the customer is:

$$x + 0.06x = 1.06x$$

We know that the customer paid $\$ 53.00$, so we can set up the equation:

$$1.06x = 53$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = \frac{53}{1.06} = 50$$

Therefore, the price of the jacket before the sales tax was $\$ 50.00$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
To solve this problem we need to work backwards, it means we need to undo the 6% sales tax to find the price of the jacket before tax was added.

Let's assume the price of the jacket before adding the sales tax was $x$,
then we can write:

$x + 6\% \; of \; x = \text{total cost}$

or 

$x + 0.06x = 53.00$

or 

$1.06x = 53.00$

or 

$x = \dfrac{53.00}{1.06}=50$

Therefore, the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added was $\$50.00$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let $x$ be the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added. 

Adding 6% sales tax to the price of $x$ gives the equation: 

$x + 0.06x = 53.00$

Combining like terms gives:

$1.06x = 53.00$

Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.06 gives:

$x = 50$

Therefore, the jacket was priced at $\$ 50.00$ before the sales tax was added.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To solve the problem, we can start by letting $x$ be the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added. Then, the amount paid by the customer is $x + 0.06x = 1.06x$. We know that this amount is $\$ 53.00$, so we can set up the equation:

$1.06x = 53$

Solving for $x$ gives:

$x = \frac{53}{1.06} = 50$

Therefore, the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added was $\$ 50.00$, which is choice B. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added be $x$. The total cost of the jacket after adding the 6% sales tax is given as $53$. 

Therefore, we have $x+\frac{6}{100}x=53$.

Solving for $x$, we get $\frac{106}{100}x=53 \Rightarrow x=\frac{53}{106}\cdot 100= \frac{5000}{106}=47.17 \approx 47.6$

Rounding off to the nearest hundredth, we get  $x \approx \$47.6$.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let the price of the jacket before tax be $x$. The equation that represents the problem is:

$x+0.06x=53$

We can factor the left-hand side of the equation to simplify it:

$x(1+0.06)=53$

$1.06x=53$

$x=\frac{53}{1.06}=50$

Therefore, the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added was $\$ 50.00$.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company purchased a machine valued at $\$ 120,000$. The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year so that after 10 years the value will be $\$ 30,000$. Which of the following equations gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased for $0 \leq t \leq 10 ?$
Choices:
  A: $v=30,000-9,000 t$
  B: $v=120,000-9,000 t$
  C: $v=120,000+9,000 t$
  D: $v=120,000-30,000 t$
Response 0:
We can find the annual depreciation of the machine by subtracting the final value from the initial value and dividing by the number of years: 

$\frac{\$120,000-\$30,000}{10 \text{ years}} = \$9,000$

So, the value of the machine, $v$, $t$ years after it was purchased can be found by subtracting $9,000t$ from the initial value of $\$120,000$:

$v = \$120,000 - \$9,000t$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
To find the depreciated value, we need to subtract the same amount, $d$, from the initial value, $V$, every year: 

- After 1 year: $V-d$
- After 2 years: $V-2d$
- After t years: $V-td$

We need to solve for $d$, given that after 10 years, the value is $\$ 30,000$. That is, when $t=10$, we have:

$V-10d=30,000$

$120,000-10d=30,000$

$d=9,000$

Therefore, the equation for the value of the machine, $v$, $t$ years after purchase is:

$v=120,000-9,000t$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
First, let's find the yearly depreciation: 
$\frac{\$ 120,000 - \$ 30,000}{10 \text{ years}} = \$ 9,000$ 

The starting value of the machine is $\$ 120,000$, so the linear equation for the value of the machine $v$ as a function of time $t$ would be: 

$v = 120,000 - 9,000 t$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
First, we need to find the rate of depreciation per year. The machine depreciates $120,000 - 30,000 = 90,000$ dollars over 10 years, so it depreciates  $90000/10 = 9000$ dollars per year. 

The initial value of the machine is $120,000$. After $t$ years, it will have depreciated by $9000t$, so its value will be $v=120,000-9000t$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year, so we can find the depreciation per year as follows:
    
    Total depreciation = 120,000 - 30,000 = 90,000
    
    Depreciation per year = Total depreciation / Number of years = 90,000 / 10 = 9,000
    
So, after $t$ years, the value of the machine will be:
    
    v = 120,000 - 9,000t
    
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
To find the rate of depreciation, we can use the formula:
$$\text{rate of depreciation} = \dfrac{\text{initial value} - \text{final value}}{\text{time}} = \dfrac{120,000-30,000}{10} = 9,000$$
Therefore, the equation that gives the value of the machine in dollars $t$ years after it was purchased is:
$$v = 120,000 - 9,000t$$
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
We know that the value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year, so we can find the amount of depreciation each year by taking the difference of the initial and final values and dividing by the number of years:
$$\text{Depreciation per year} = \frac{\text{final value} - \text{initial value}}{\text{number of years}} = \frac{30,000 - 120,000}{10} = -9,000$$
Note that the depreciation is negative because the value is decreasing. 

We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the value $v$ at any time $t$:
$$v - 120,000 = -9,000(t-0)$$
Simplifying and solving for $v$, we get:
$$v = 120,000 - 9,000t$$
Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
We know that the value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year. So, the decrease in value each year is $\dfrac{\$ 120,000 - \$ 30,000}{10 \text{ years}} = \$ 9,000$ per year. 

When $t$ years have passed, the machine has lost $9000t$ in value. So, the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased is:

$V = \$ 120,000 - \$ 9,000t$

  B: $(0,3)$
  C: $(6,-3)$
  D: $(36,-6)$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Firstly, we substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for $y$. 
$$\begin{aligned} \frac{x}{2}+2 y=&6 \\ \frac{y-3}{2}+2 y=&6 \\5 y=&15 \\y =& 3 \end{aligned}$$
Then we can substitute $y=3$ into the first equation to solve for $x$.
$$\begin{aligned}x =& y-3 \\x =&3-3 \\x =& 0 \end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the answer is $(x, y) = (0, 3)$
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
We can begin by substituting the value of $x$ from the first equation into the second equation:
$$\frac{y-3}{2}+2y=6$$
Simplifying and solving for $y$ yields:
$$\frac{5}{2}y = \frac{15}{2} \Rightarrow y=3$$
Now we can use the first equation to find the corresponding value of $x$:
$$x=3-3=0$$
Therefore, the ordered pair is $(x,y)=(0,3)$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Substituting $x$ from the first equation into second equation, we get $$\frac{y-3}{2}+2y=6.$$Solving for $y$, we get $y=3$. Substituting this value of $y$ in the first equation, we get $x=0$. Therefore, the ordered pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the system of equations is $(0,3)$.  

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
We start by substituting $x=y-3$ into the second equation to get $$
\frac{y-3}{2}+2 y=6.
$$Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction gives $$
y-3+4 y=12
$$Simplifying the left-hand side gives $$
5 y=15,
$$so $y=3$. Substituting this value into the first equation gives $$
x=3-3=0.
$$Therefore, the ordered pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the system of equations is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\;(0,3)}.$

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week?
Choices:
  A: 38
  B: 33
  C: 22
  D: 16
Response 0:
Let $x$ be the number of hours he works for the rest of the week.
Then, he earns a total of $8(10) + 10x = 80 + 10x$ dollars for the week.
Ken saves 90% of what he earns, which is $0.9(80 + 10x) = 72 + 9x$ dollars.
We want this to be at least $270$, so we have $72 + 9x \ge 270$.
Subtracting 72 from both sides, we get $9x \ge 198$.
Dividing both sides by 9, we get $x \ge 22$.
This means the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $270 is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 1:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week.
Then his total earnings for the week are $8 \cdot 10 + 10x = 80 + 10x$.
Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings each week, so he saves $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$ dollars.
We are given that he wants to save at least $\$270$, so we have \begin{align*}
72+9x & \geq 270 \\
9x & \geq 198 \\
x & \geq 22.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\text{(C) }22}$.
Response 2:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works at $\$ 10$ per hour. He has $40-x$ hours remaining for the week at $\$ 8$ per hour. We want to find the least value of $x$ that makes his savings at least $\$ 270$. 
Ken earns $8\cdot 10=80$ dollars for the $8$ hours he works at $\$ 8$ per hour. He earns $10x$ dollars for the $x$ hours he works at $\$ 10$ per hour, making his total earnings $80+10x$. 
Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so the amount of money he saves is $0.9(80+10x)+0.9(8(40-x))=72+9x$ dollars. 
Setting $72+9x\geq 270$ and solving for $x$, we have $x\geq 22$. The smallest integer greater than or equal to $22$ is $22$. Thus, the least number of hours Ken must work is $x+8=22+8=\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 38}$.
Response 3:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then he will have worked $10+x$ hours in total and earned \begin{align*}
10(10+x-10)+8(10)&=8x+80+100\\
&=8x+180.
\end{align*} Ken will save $90\%$ of $8x+180$, which is $0.9(8x+180)=7.2x+162$. We are looking for the least value of $x$ such that $7.2x+162\geq 270$. Solving this inequality gives $x\geq \frac{108}{6}=18$, so Ken must work for at least $18$ hours the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$. 

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week. The total amount of money he earns for the week is $8\cdot10+10x=80+10x$. The amount he saves is $0.90(80+10x)=72+9x$. We want to solve the inequality $72+9x\geq 270$. 

Simplifying the inequality gives $9x\geq 198$. Dividing by $9$ gives $x\geq 22$. 

Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work for the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 5:
First, let's calculate how much money Ken earned for the first 10 hours of work: $10 \text{ hours} \cdot \$8/\text{hour} = \$80$.

Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works after the first 10 hours, where he earns $\$10$ per hour. The total amount of money he earns for the week is then: $80 + 10h$.

Ken saves $90\%$ of his earnings, so he saves: $0.9(80 + 10h) = 72 + 9h$.

We want to find the least $h$ such that $72 + 9h \geq 270$. Solving for $h$, we get:

\begin{align*}
72 + 9h &\geq 270 \\
9h &\geq 198 \\
h &\geq 22
\end{align*}

So Ken must work at least $22$ more hours. 

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let $x$ be the number of hours that Ken works the rest of the week. His total earnings for the week is $(10)(x) + (8)(10) = 10x+80$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of these earnings, so he saves $0.9(10x+80) = 9x + 72$ dollars. We want to find the least $x$ such that $9x + 72 \geq 270$. Solving this inequality, we get $x \geq 22$. Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$ hours.
Response 7:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken has to work for the rest of the week. Then, he will earn $(x)(\$ 10)$ for the rest of the week and $(10)(\$ 8)$ for the first 10 hours. The total earnings for the week is $\$ 80+10x$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of these earnings, which is $0.9(\$ 80+10x) = 72 + 9x$. We set up the inequality $72 + 9x \ge 270$, solve, and get $x \ge 22$. Therefore, the least number of hours he must work for the rest of the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$.
Response 8:
Let's call the number of hours that Ken needs to work after the first 10 hours as $h$. 

He earned $\$8 \cdot 10 = \$80$ for the first 10 hours and he earns $\$10h$ for the remaining hours. 

His total earnings for the week before savings is $\$80 + \$10h$. 

Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(\$80+\$10h)$. 

We want this to be greater than or equal to $\$270$, so we can write the inequality: 

$$0.9(\$80+\$10h) \geq \$270$$

Simplifying this inequality gives $h \geq 17$. 

This means Ken needs to work at least 17 hours after the first 10 hours to save at least $\$270$ for the week. 

However, 17 is not one of our answer choices, so we need to check the answer choices starting with the largest one and working our way down. 

Checking choice A: If he works $38$ hours after the first 10 hours, he will earn $\$80 + \$10(38) = \$460$. Saving $90 \%$ of this gives $\$414$, which is greater than $\$270$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }38}$.
Response 9:
Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken needs to work at $\$ 10$ per hour. Since he will work $10$ hours at $\$ 8$ per hour, his total earnings for the week before saving is $10(\$ 8) + h(\$ 10) = 80 + 10h$. We know that Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so his total earnings for the week are $0.10(80 + 10h) + 0.90(80 + 10h) = 0.80(80 + 10h)$. We want this expression to be at least $\$ 270$, so we write $0.80(80 + 10h) \geq 270$. Simplifying this inequality gives $h \geq 22$. Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work at $\$ 10$ per hour is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages. For each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. What is the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 6
Response 0:
Let the number of 100-pound packages be x, and the number of 120-pound packages be y. Since the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, we know that x + y ≥ 10. Also, the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y ≤ 1100. We want to maximize the value of y, so we want to solve for y in terms of x and then find the largest possible integer y that satisfies both inequalities.

First, we can simplify the second inequality by dividing both sides by 20: 5x + 6y ≤ 55. Solving for y in terms of x, we get y ≤ (55 - 5x)/6.

Now we can combine the two inequalities to get: 

x + y ≥ 10  
y ≤ (55 - 5x)/6  

Multiplying both sides of the second inequality by 6, we get 6y ≤ 55 - 5x. Adding 5x to both sides, we get 5x + 6y ≤ 55. This is the same as the second inequality we had before, but now it also satisfies the first inequality. 

So the maximum number of 120-pound packages is the largest integer y that satisfies 5x + 6y ≤ 55. We can try different values of x to find the largest possible y. 

If x = 0, then 6y ≤ 55, so y ≤ 9. The largest integer y that satisfies this is y = 9. 
If x = 1, then 5 + 6y ≤ 55, so 6y ≤ 50, and y ≤ 8. The largest integer y that satisfies this is y = 8. 
If x = 2, then 10 + 6y ≤ 55, so 6y ≤ 45, and y ≤ 7. The largest integer y that satisfies this is y = 7. 
If x = 3, then 15 + 6y ≤ 55, so 6y ≤ 40, and y ≤ 6. 

Since y can be at most 6, but cannot be greater than 6 while still satisfying the first inequality, the maximum number of 120-pound packages is 6. 

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let X be the number of 120-pound packages, and Y be the number of 100-pound packages. Since the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, we can write:
X + Y >= 10

Also, the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so we have:
120X + 100Y <= 1,100

We want to maximize the number of 120-pound packages, which is X. We can solve for Y in the first equation to get:
Y >= 10 - X

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
120X + 100(10 - X) <= 1,100
Simplifying and solving for X, we get:
X <= 5.5

Since X has to be an integer, the maximum number of 120-pound packages is 5.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's suppose that the helicopter takes "x" 100-pound packages and "y" 120-pound packages.
From the given information, we know that:
- x+y >= 10 (since at least 10 packages must be carried)
- 100x + 120y <= 1100 (since the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)
We need to find the maximum value of "y" that satisfies these conditions.
Let's solve for "y" in the second equation:
120y <= 1100 - 100x
y <= (1100 - 100x)/120
y <= 11/12 - (5/6)x
So, the maximum value of "y" occurs when x is at its minimum, i.e., when x=10-y. 
Replacing x with 10-y in the inequality for "y", we get:
y <= 11/12 - (5/6)(10-y)
y <= 6 - (5/6)y
11/6y <= 6
y <= 36/11
So, the maximum possible value of "y" is 3 and the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 3.
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the number of 100-pound packages is x and the number of 120-pound packages is y. We know that x + y ≥ 10 and 100x + 120y ≤ 1100.
We can rearrange the second equation to get 5x + 6y ≤ 55.
Now let's test the answer choices.
If we choose 6 packages of 120 lbs, then we can have only 4 packages of 100 lbs, which results in 4x100 + 6x120 = 960 lbs, which is within the limit. Therefore we choose Answer("D").
Response 6:
Let x be the number of 100-pound packages and y be the number of 120-pound packages. 
We know that:
x + y ≥ 10 (since the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages per trip)
100x + 120y ≤ 1,100 (since the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)
To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, we want to minimize the number of 100-pound packages. We can start by assuming that all 10 packages are 100-pound packages:
10(100) + 0(120) = 1,000
This is less than 1,100, so we can try replacing 2 of the 100-pound packages with 2 120-pound packages:
8(100) + 2(120) = 1,040
This is still less than 1,100, so we can try replacing 2 more of the 100-pound packages with 2 more 120-pound packages:
6(100) + 4(120) = 1,080
This is still less than 1,100, so we can try replacing 2 more of the 100-pound packages with 2 more 120-pound packages:
4(100) + 6(120) = 1,120
This is more than 1,100, so the maximum number of 120-pound packages the helicopter can carry per trip is 4.
Therefore, Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the number of 100-pound packages is x and the number of 120-pound packages is y. Based on the given condition: x + y >= 10 and 100x + 120y <= 1100.

To solve for y, we need to find the maximum value of y that satisfies these conditions. 

First, let's simplify the second condition: 

100x + 120y <= 1100
10x + 12y <= 110
5x + 6y <= 55
y <= (55 - 5x)/6

Now, we need to find the maximum integer value of y that satisfies x + y >= 10 and y <= (55 - 5x)/6. 

By trial and error, we can see that the maximum integer value of y is 4 when x is 2. Any value of y greater than 4 would result in the total weight exceeding 1100 pounds. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let x be the number of 100-pound packages and y be the number of 120-pound packages.
Then we have the following system of inequalities:
x + y >= 10          (The helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
100x + 120y <= 1100  (The total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)
We want to maximize y, so we convert the first inequality to y >= 10 - x and substitute it into the second inequality:
100x + 120y <= 1100
100x + 120(10 - x) <= 1100
Solving for x, we get x <= 3.5
Since x must be a whole number, the largest possible value of x is 3.
Then the largest possible value of y is 10 - x = 7.
Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 7.
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries "x" 100-pound packages and "y" 120-pound packages.
From the given information:
- A trip carries at least 10 packages: x + y >= 10
- The total weight of packages can be at most 1,100 pounds: 100x + 120y <= 1,100
We want to find the maximum value of "y". To solve this problem, we can use substitution method by isolating "x" in the first equation:
x >= 10 - y
Substituting this inequality in the second equation, we get:
100(10 - y) + 120y <= 1,100
1,000 - 100y + 120y <= 1,100
20y <= 100
y <= 5
Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline0 & 3 \\\hline2 & 1 \\\hline4 & 0 \\\hline5 & -2 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The function $f$ is defined by a polynomial. Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-2$
  B: $x-3$
  C: $x-4$
  D: $x-5$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")  
Solution: Since $f(0)=3$, the constant term in the polynomial is 3. The linear term is $f(x)-f(0)/(x-0)$, where $f(x)-f(0)$ is the change in $f$ as $x$ increases from 0 to $x$, namely $f(x)-3$. Therefore \begin{align*}f(x)-3&=\frac{f(x)-f(0)}{x-0}x \\ &= \frac{f(x)-3}{x}x.\end{align*}Thus $f(x)-3$ is divisible by $x$. We conclude that $f(x)$ is divisible by $\boxed{x-2}$, since $f(2)=1$.
Response 1:
We observe that when $f(2)=1$, $f(4)=0$, and $f(5)=-2$; the differences between the values of $f(x)$ are $(-1)$ and $(-2)$ respectively. We can hypothesize that the function $f(x)$ is of degree $3$, since the differences in the $y$ values are not constant. Therefore, we can test all the answer choices by dividing $f(x)$ by each choice and verify if any of them give a quotient of degree $2$. Performing the division, we find that 

- $f(x)/(x-2) = x^2+2x-3$
- $f(x)/(x-3) = x^2+3x+9$
- $f(x)/(x-4) = x^2+4x+8$   (Note: we can stop checking after this one because the quotient will be of degree 2)
- $f(x)/(x-5)$ is not defined

Therefore, the correct answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")  
Solution: Notice that for $x=2$ we have $f(2)=1$ and for $x=0$ we have $f(0)=3,$ so $(x-2)$ is a factor of the polynomial by the Factor Theorem.
Response 3:
We can see that $f(2)=1$ and $f(4)=0$. Therefore, the polynomial must have $(x-2)$ and $(x-4)$ as factors by the Factor Theorem. 

Checking each option, we see that only $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ x-2}$ is a factor. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
We consider the factor theorem which states that if $a$ is a root of a polynomial $P(x)$, then $x-a$ is a factor of $P(x)$. To check which of the given factors are roots of $f(x)$, we can simply check when $f(x) = 0$.
\begin{align*}
f(0) &= 3 \neq 0\\
f(2) &= 1 \neq 0\\
f(4) &= 0\\
f(5) &= -2 \neq 0
\end{align*}
Thus, we see that only $x-4$ is a factor of $f(x)$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A") 

A polynomial must have a factor of $x-c$ if and only if $c$ is a root of the polynomial. Thus, $f(2)=1$ tells us that $x-2$ must be a factor of $f(x)$. By the Factor Theorem, $f(4)=0$ tells us that $x-4$ must be a factor of $f(x)$. Since $f(x)$ is defined by a polynomial and $x-2$ and $x-4$ must be factors of $f(x)$, it follows that $(x-2)(x-4)$ must be a factor of $f(x)$. Therefore, the answer is (A) $x-2$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")  
Solution:  
A polynomial function will have a factor $(x-a)$ if and only if $a$ is a root of the polynomial function. Looking at the table, we can see that $f(2)=1$. Therefore, $x=2$ is a root of the polynomial function, and it follows that there is a factor of $(x-2)$ in $f(x)$. Similarly, $f(4)=0$ means $x=4$ is a root of the polynomial function, and so $(x-4)$ is a factor of $f(x)$. Also, $f(5)=-2$, which shows that $x=5$ is a root of the polynomial function, and therefore $(x-5)$ is a factor of $f(x)$. However, $f(0)=3$, which means $x=0$ is not a root of the polynomial function. Therefore, $(x-0)$ or simply $x$ is not a factor of $f(x)$. Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }x-2}.$
Response 9:
To check which one of the options is necessarily a factor of $f(x)$, we can use the Factor Theorem which states that if $r$ is a root of a polynomial function $f(x)$, then $(x-r)$ is a factor of $f(x)$. Another way to say this is that if $f(r)=0$, then $(x-r)$ is a factor of $f(x)$.

We can see from the table that $f(2)=1$ and $f(4)=0$. Therefore, $(x-2)$ and $(x-4)$ are factors of $f(x)$. 

Answer: $\boldsymbol{\text{(A)}\ x-2}$ and $\boldsymbol{\text{(C)}\ x-4}$ are both factors of $\boldsymbol{f(x)}$.

  C: 14

Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 2:
First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of the points that the parabola intersects the line $y=25$: 

$(x - 11)^2 = 25 \Rightarrow x-11=\pm5 \Rightarrow x=6,16$

Therefore, the points of intersection are $(6, 25)$ and $(16, 25)$.

The distance between these two points is:

$\sqrt{(16-6)^2 + (25-25)^2} = \sqrt{10^2} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }10}$
Response 3:
We are given that the intersection points are at $y=25$. So let's set $y=25$ in the equation of parabola and solve for $x$.

$$(x-11)^{2}=25$$
Taking square roots,
$$x-11=\pm 5$$
So, $x=6$ or $x=16$.

Therefore, the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are $(6, 25)$ and $(16, 25)$ respectively.

Thus, the length of $\overline{A B}$ is $16-6=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 14}.$

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$
Response 0:
To find the best linear function $f$ to model the production, we need to use the point-slope form of a linear equation: $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line. 

In this case, $(x_1,y_1)=(0,4)$ because the production was 4 million barrels in the year 2000. We also know that $(13,1.9)$ is another point on the line because the production dropped from 4 million barrels to 1.9 million barrels over 13 years. 

Using the two points, we can calculate the slope of the line: $m=\frac{1.9-4}{13-0}=-\frac{21}{130}$.

Now we can plug in the slope and the point $(0,4)$ into the point-slope form and simplify: 
$$f(t)-4=-\frac{21}{130}t$$ 
$$f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$$ 

Therefore, the correct answer is $\textbf{(C)}$ $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$.
Response 1:
To find the linear function, we need to use the slope-intercept form $f(t)=mt+b$, where $m$ is the slope (the rate of decrease) and $b$ is the initial production in the year 2000. We can use the slope formula $m=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$ to find $m$. 

From 2000 to 2013, $t$ increased by 13 years, and the production decreased from 4 to 1.9 million barrels, so the change in $y$ is $1.9-4=-2.1$ million barrels. Therefore, $m=\frac{-2.1}{13}=-\frac{21}{130}$. 

To find $b$, we can substitute $m$ and one of the given data points $(t,y)$, such as $(0,4)$, into the slope-intercept form and solve for $b$: $4=-\frac{21}{130}\cdot 0+b$. Therefore, $b=4$.

So the linear function that models the oil and gas production is $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
We know that oil and gas production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. This means that in 13 years (from 2000 to 2013), the production decreased by $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels. Therefore, the rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13}=0.161538\approx\frac{2}{13}$ million barrels per year.

We can use the point-slope form of a linear function to model the production: $f(t)=m(t-0)+4$, where $m$ is the slope of the line. Since the production is decreasing, the slope $m$ is negative. Therefore, we can eliminate choices (A) and (B) because they have positive slopes.

The correct equation should have a slope of approximately $-\frac{2}{13}$. We can see that choice (C) has a slope of $-\frac{21}{130}=-\frac{3}{26}\approx -\frac{2}{13}$, while choice (D) has a slope of $-\frac{19}{130}\approx -\frac{2}{13}$. However, since the production in 2000 was 4 million barrels, we know that $f(0)=4$. Choice (C) gives $f(0)=4$, while choice (D) gives $f(0)=\frac{247}{65}>4$. Therefore, the best option is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
We can use the point-slope formula to derive the linear function. The point-slope formula is $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$ where $m$ is the slope of the line and $(x_1,y_1)$ is any point on the line.
Using the two given data points: $(0,4)$ (year 2000) and $(13,1.9)$ (year 2013), we have: 
$$m=\frac{1.9-4}{13-0}=-\frac{21}{130}$$
Using point-slope formula with point $(0,4)$, we get:
$$f(t)-4=-\frac{21}{130} t$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$$
Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
To find the linear function that models the oil and gas production, we can use the slope-intercept form of the equation f(t) = m(t) + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. The slope represents the constant rate of decrease in the oil and gas production. 

Using the given data, we can find the slope by calculating the change in production over the change in time: 

Slope = (1.9 - 4) million barrels / (2013 - 2000) years
Slope = -0.15 million barrels / year 

Therefore, the correct function is the one whose slope is equal to -0.15. 

Checking the slopes of the given functions: 

A: slope = 21/130 (not equal to -0.15)
B: slope = 19/130 (not equal to -0.15)
C: slope = -21/130 (not equal to -0.15)
D: slope = -19/130 (equal to -0.15)

Since the slope of function D matches our calculated slope for the oil and gas production, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's find the slope of the line connecting the two points (0, 4) and (13, 1.9).
Slope $m = \frac{1.9 - 4}{13 - 0} = -\frac{21}{130}$. 

Now, we use the point-slope form of a line, and plug in the point (0, 4):
$f(t) = -\frac{21}{130}t + 4$

Therefore, 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
We can use the point-slope formula of a linear function with the two data points (0,4) and (13,1.9). The slope is found by: 

slope $=\frac{1.9-4}{13-0}=-\frac{21}{130}$

The y-intercept is 4. Therefore, the linear function is:

$f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t + 4$

Thus, the correct answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To find the correct answer, we need to use the point-slope form of a linear equation where the slope is the rate of decrease and the initial production (in 2000) is a point on the line. We have two points: $(0, 4)$ and $(13, 1.9)$, where $t = 0$ corresponds to the year 2000. Thus, the slope of the line is $(1.9 - 4)/(13 - 0) = -0.1/2 = -0.05$. Using the point-slope formula, we get the equation: $f(t) - 4 = -0.05t$, which simplifies to $f(t) = -0.05t + 4$. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
To find the linear function, we need to use the slope-intercept formula: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept. In this case, the y-intercept is the initial oil and gas production in 2000, which is 4 million barrels. Since the production dropped by 2.1 million barrels over the course of 13 years, the slope of the line is $-\frac{2.1}{13}=-\frac{21}{130}$. Thus, the linear function that models the production is $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$, which is option C.

The production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a period of 13 years. Therefore, we can calculate the average rate of change as follows:
Average rate of change = $\frac{\text{change in production}}{\text{change in time}}=\frac{1.9-4}{13}=-\frac{21}{130}$
We can use the point-slope formula to obtain the equation of the line:
$f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}(t-0)+4=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$
So, the answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.

Question: The formula below is often used by project managers to compute $E$, the estimated time to complete a job, where $O$ is the shortest completion time, $P$ is the longest completion time, and $M$ is the most likely completion time.$$E=\frac{O+4 M+P}{6}$$Which of the following correctly gives $P$ in terms of $E, O$, and $M$ ?
Choices:
  A: $P=6 E-O-4 M$
  B: $P=-6 E+O+4 M$
  C: $P=\frac{O+4 M+E}{6}$
  D: $P=\frac{O+4 M-E}{6}$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
To solve for P, we need to isolate P on one side of the equation. 

Action: Answer("A") 

So we add $-O-4M$ on both sides of the equation, giving us $P=6E-O-4M$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
We can solve the equation for $P$. First, we multiply both sides by 6 to get $$6E=O+4M+P.$$ Then, we isolate $P$ by subtracting $O+4M$ from both sides to get $$P=6E-O-4M.$$ Therefore, the correct answer is: 

Action: Answer( "A" )
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
To solve for $P$, we can rearrange the given formula as follows:$$E=\frac{O+4M+P}{6} \implies P= 6E-O-4M$$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
We can solve the given formula for $P$ as follows: 

$E=\frac{O+4M+P}{6}$

Multiplying both sides by 6 gives:

$6E=O+4M+P$

Subtracting $O+4M$ from both sides, we get:

$P=6E-O-4M$

Therefore, the answer is (A) $P=6E-O-4M$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
We can solve the formula for $P$ by multiplying both sides by $6$ and isolating $P$. 
\begin{align*}
E&=\frac{O+4M+P}{6}\\
6E&=O+4M+P\\
P&=6E-O-4M
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is (A) $P=6E-O-4M$.
Response 8:
To isolate $P$ in the given equation, we can first multiply both sides by $6$ to get $$6E=O+4M+P.$$Then, by subtracting $O+4M$ from both sides, we get $$P=6E-O-4M.$$Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
To obtain $P$ in terms of $E, O$, and $M$, we can start by isolating $P$ in the formula for $E$. 

\begin{align*}
E &= \frac{O+4M+P}{6} \\
6E &= O+4M+P \\
6E-O-4M &= P
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is:

Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline1 & 5 \\\hline3 & 13 \\\hline5 & 21 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of the linear function $f$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=2 x+3$
  B: $f(x)=3 x+2$
  C: $f(x)=4 x+1$
  D: $f(x)=5 x$
Response 0:
Let's first find the slope of the linear function $f$,

\begin{align*}
\text{slope} &= \frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}} \\
&= \frac{f(5)-f(1)}{5-1} \\
&= \frac{21-5}{4} \\
&= 4
\end{align*}

So, the slope of the linear function is 4. Also, note that the function passes through the point (1,5). Therefore, the equation of the linear function is:

\begin{align*}
f(x) &= \text{slope}\times x+\text{y-intercept} \\
&= 4x+1
\end{align*}

Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } f(x)=4x+1}$.
Response 1:
To determine the equation of a line given two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, we use the formula $$y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)$$ We can see that $f(1) = 5$, $f(3) = 13$, and $f(5) = 21$. Using these points, we compute: $$\begin{aligned} f(x) - 5 &= \frac{13 - 5}{3 - 1}(x - 1) \\ &= 4(x - 1) \\ &= 4x - 4 \end{aligned}$$ Simplifying, we get $f(x) = 4x + 1$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } f(x) = 4 x+1}$.
Response 2:
To find the pattern in the table, we look at the differences in the output values (i.e. $f(x)$) for each pair of input values. We see that adding 8 to the output value increases the input value by 2. Therefore, the slope of the linear function is $\frac{8}{2}=4$ and the $y$-intercept is 1. So the equation of the function is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
We can observe that the difference in values of $f(x)$ for every increase in $x$ is the same. Since the value of $f(x)$ increases by $8$ every time $x$ increases by $2$, we can deduce that the slope of the linear function is $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=4$. Using slope-intercept form, we have: $f(x)-f(1)= 4(x-1)$. Simplifying gives us $f(x)= 4x+1$, thus the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\  f(x)=4 x+1}$.
Response 4:
We can see that for each value of $x$, we get $f(x)$ by adding 2 to the value of $x$, then multiplying by 4.  Thus, 

$$f(x) = 4(x+2)$$

So the answer is (C) $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
First, let us find the slope of the function $f$. We know that for any two points $(x_1,f(x_1))$ and $(x_2,f(x_2))$ on the function $f$, the slope is given by $\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$. Using the two points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$, the slope is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. Thus, we can eliminate choices A, B and C, as they all have different slopes. The only choice with a slope of 4 is D. Therefore:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
We can find the slope of the line using two points from the table: $\frac{f(5)-f(1)}{5-1}=\frac{21-5}{4}=4$. Then the equation of the line is $f(x)-5=4(x-1)$ or $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Subtracting the values for the ordered pairs $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ gives a slope of $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. Therefore, $f(x) = 4x+b$. To find $b$, we plug in the $x$ and $f(x)$ value from the table. That is, $5=4(1)+b$, giving $b=1$. Thus, $f(x) = 4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To find the linear function $f$, we can use the slope-intercept form:
$$f(x) = mx + b$$
where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. 

To find $m$, we can use any two points on the line (e.g. $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$):
$$m =\frac{13-5}{3-1} = 4$$

To find $b$, we can substitute one of the points on the line and the slope:
$$5 = 4(1) + b \Rightarrow b = 1$$

Therefore, the function $f$ is:
$$f(x) = 4x + 1$$

Question: Dreams Recalled during One Week\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\hline& None & 1 to 4 & 5 or more & Total \\\hline\hlineGroup X & 15 & 28 & 57 & 100 \\\hlineGroup Y & 21 & 11 & 68 & 100 \\\hlineTotal & 36 & 39 & 125 & 200 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The data in the table above were produced by a sleep researcher studying the number of dreams people recall when asked to record their dreams for one week. Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$
Response 0:
There were $39+125=164$ people that recalled at least one dream. Of those, $68$ belonged to Group Y. So the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{68}{164}=\frac{17}{41}$$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that he/she recalled at least 1 dream is equal to the probability that he/she belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream divided by the probability that he/she recalled at least 1 dream. 

The probability that the person belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{68}{200}$. The probability that the person recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{164}{200}$.

Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that he/she recalled at least 1 dream is $$\frac{68/200}{164/200} = \frac{68}{164} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{79}{164}}.$$
Response 2:
Out of the $39$ people who recalled at least 1 dream, $68$ people belonged to Group Y. 

Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{68}{39} = \frac{4 \cdot 17}{3 \cdot 13} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$$
Response 3:
Out of the 39 people who recalled dreams between 1 to 4, 11 are from Group Y. 
Out of the 125 people who recalled 5 or more dreams, 68 are from Group Y. 
Therefore, out of the total of 164 people who recalled at least one dream, 11 + 68 = 79 are from Group Y. 
So the probability is:

$$\text{Probability} = \dfrac{\text{Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream}}{\text{Total number of people who recalled at least one dream}} = \frac{79}{164}$$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
The probability we are looking for is the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream:

$$\frac{\text{Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}}=\frac{68}{39+68}=\frac{68}{107}$$

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 1:

$$\frac{68}{107}=\frac{4}{7}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{79}{164}}$.
Response 5:
Out of the 39 people who recalled between 1 to 4 dreams, 11 belonged to Group Y. Out of the 125 people who recalled 5 or more dreams, 68 belonged to Group Y. Therefore, the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream and belonged to Group Y is $11+68=79$. The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $36+39+125=200$. Thus, the probability that a person chosen at random who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y is $\frac{79}{200}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
The total number of people who recalled at least one dream is $39+125=164$, out of which $68$ belong to Group Y. Hence the probability is:
$$\frac{\text{Number of people who recalled at least one dream in Group Y}}{\text{Total number of people who recalled at least one dream}} = \frac{68}{164}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{79}{164}}$$
Response 7:
Out of the 39 people who recalled dreams in Group X, $28/39$ is the proportion of people who recalled at least 1 dream. Out of the 125 people who recalled dreams in Group Y, $79/125$ is the proportion of people who recalled at least 1 dream. The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is the proportion of people who belong to Group Y and also recalled at least $1$ dream. 

So, using conditional probability formula:$$\dfrac{\text{number of people in Y who recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream }} = \frac{79/125}{28/39+79/125}$$

Simplifying the fraction and rationalizing the denominator, we have $$\frac{79/125}{28/39+79/125} = \frac{79}{164}$$

Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{79}{164}}$.
Response 8:
The probability of a person being chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream is: $\dfrac{39+125}{200}=82/100$. Out of the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream, the probability of the person being from Group Y is: $\dfrac{68}{68+57}= 68/125$. Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is: 
$\frac{68}{125} \cdot \frac{125}{82} = \frac{68}{82} = \frac{34}{41}$.

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y = $\frac{\text{Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream}}{\text{Total number of people who recalled at least one dream}}$.

The total number of people who recalled at least one dream = $39+125 = 164$, and the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream = $11+68 = 79$.

Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y = $\frac{79}{164}$.

Topic: Math
Question: $$C=75 h+125$$The equation above gives the amount $C$, in dollars, an electrician charges for a job that takes $h$ hours. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland each hired this electrician. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. How much more did the electrician charge Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 75$
  B: $\$ 125$
  C: $\$ 150$
  D: $\$ 275$
Response 0:
Let $h_1$ be the hours the electrician worked on Mr. Roland's job. Then, the electrician worked $h_1 + 2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. Therefore, the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is $C_1 = 75h_1 + 125$ dollars, and the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C_2 = 75(h_1+2)+125=75h_1+275$ dollars.

Subtracting $C_1$ from $C_2$, we have that Ms. Sanchez was charged an extra $\$ (C_2-C_1) = \$(75h_1+275-(75h_1+125)) = \$(150)$. 

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
We can begin by setting up two equations, one for Ms. Sanchez's job and one for Mr. Roland's job. Let $h$ be the number of hours the electrician worked on Mr. Roland's job. Then, he worked $h+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. Using the equation, we find:

- For Mr. Roland's job: $C = 75h+125$
- For Ms. Sanchez's job: $C = 75(h+2)+125 = 75h+225$

To find the difference in their charges, we can subtract the equation for Mr. Roland's job from the equation for Ms. Sanchez's job:

$$C_\text{Sanchez} - C_\text{Roland} = (75h+225)-(75h+125) = 100$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Let's start with Mr. Roland's job: 
If the electrician worked for $h$ hours, then the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is given by $C=75h+125$.
Let's say the electrician worked on Ms. Sanchez's job for $h+2$ hours (2 hours longer).
Then, the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C=75(h+2)+125= 75h+150+125=75h+275$.
Therefore, the difference in the amount charged is:
\begin{align*}
\text{Ms. Sanchez's charge - Mr. Roland's charge} &= (75h+275)-(75h+125)\\
&=150
\end{align*}
So, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's first find how much the electrician charged Mr. Roland.
Given that $C=75h+125$, let's substitute $h$ for the number of hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland. Let's call this number of hours $x$. So Mr. Roland paid $C=75x+125$ dollars.  

Ms. Sanchez paid for 2 more hours than Mr. Roland so the number of hours the electrician worked for Ms. Sanchez was $x+2$.
So Ms. Sanchez paid $C = 75(x+2) + 125 = 75x + 225$ dollars.

The difference between what Ms. Sanchez paid and what Mr. Roland paid is:

\begin{align*}
75x +225 - (75x+125) &= 100\\
\end{align*}

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.

Let the number of hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland be $x$. Then, the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job is $C=75 x+125$. 

For Ms. Sanchez's job, the electrician worked for 2 hours longer, which means the number of hours the electrician worked for Ms. Sanchez is $x+2$. Hence, the amount charged by the electrician for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C=75(x+2)+125=75x+225$.

The difference between the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job is:

\begin{align*}
75x+225-(75x+125)&=100 \\
\end{align*}

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$ 100$ more than Mr. Roland.

Answer: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Let's first find the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job:
$C_R=75h+125$, where $h$ is the number of hours worked on Mr. Roland's job.
And for Ms. Sanchez's job, the electrician worked for 2 additional hours, so $h+2$ hours were worked and the amount charged is:
$C_S=75(h+2)+125=75h+150+125=75h+275$
The difference in the amount charged is:
$C_S-C_R=(75h+275)-(75h+125)=150$
Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$ 150$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's use the given equation for each job:
- Ms. Sanchez's job: $C_S = 75(h+2) + 125 = 75h + 275$
- Mr. Roland's job: $C_R = 75h + 125$
The difference in the amount charged is:
$$C_S - C_R = (75h+275) - (75h+125) = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$ 150}$$
Response 7:
Let the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job be $C_R$.
Then, amount charged by the electrician for Ms. Sanchez's job is given by $C_S = 75(h+2) + 125 = 75h + 275$.
The difference in the amount charged is given by: 
$$C_S - C_R = (75h + 275) - (75h + 125) = 150$$
Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland.
Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$150}$.
Response 8:
Let the number of hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland be $x$. Then, the number of hours the electrician worked for Ms. Sanchez is $x+2$. 

The cost for Mr. Roland is $$C = 75x+125.$$ 

The cost for Ms. Sanchez is $$C = 75(x+2)+125.$$ 

Thus, the difference is $$75(x+2)+125 - (75x+125) = 150.$$ 

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's first find the cost for the number of hours worked by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. Let $x$ be the number of hours worked for Mr. Roland's job. Then the cost of Mr. Roland's job will be $$C_R=75x+125$$ Since the electrician worked $2$ hours more in Ms. Sanchez's job, the number of hours worked for her job is $x+2$. Thus the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job is $$C_S=75(x+2)+125=75x+225$$ Now, we need to find the difference in their costs: $$C_S - C_R = (75x+225) - (75x+125) = 100$$

So, the answer is $\$100$, which means the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland. Thus the answer is:

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
To solve the problem, we can set up two equations. One equation relates the food calories to the grams of nutrient: $180=4p+9f+4c$. The second equation relates the food calories to the kilojoules of energy: $180=16.7(p+f+c)$. Solving the second equation for $p+f+c$, we find $p+f+c=\frac{180}{16.7}\approx10.78$. Substituting this into the first equation and solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Simplifying, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.
Response 1:
We are given that 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate. From the table, we know that the number of food calories per gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate are 4, 9, and 4, respectively. So we can write an equation for the total number of food calories in terms of $p$, $f$, and $c$:

$4p+9f+4c=180$

We want to express $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$, so we solve for $f$:

$9f=180-4p-4c$

$f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$

$f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 2:
To solve the problem, we need to use the information given in the table and create an equation relating the 180 food calories to the amount of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in the granola bar. We have:
$$
180=4p+9f+4c.
$$
Solving for $f$, we get:
\begin{align*}
180 &= 4p + 9f + 4c \\
180 - 4p - 4c &= 9f \\
f &= \frac{180 - 4p - 4c}{9} \\
f &= 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c).
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 3:
The amount of energy in the granola bar is given by $180=4p+9f+4c$. Solving for $f$ we get $f=\frac{1}{9}(180-4p-4c)=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
The granola bar gives us 180 food calories in total.
Each gram of protein produces 4 food calories.
Each gram of fat produces 9 food calories.
Each gram of carbohydrate produces 4 food calories.

So, 
- the number of food calories obtained from protein is $4p$, 
- the number of food calories obtained from fat is $9f$, 
- the number of food calories obtained from carbohydrate is $4c$.

The total number of food calories is the sum of these quantities:

$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$

Solving for $f$ gives:

$9f = 180 - 4p - 4c$ 

$f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Answer:  $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.
Response 5:
Given that energy per 1 gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate are 4.0, 9.0, and 4.0 food calories, respectively.
So, the given granola bar contains $p/4$ grams of protein, $f/9$ grams of fat, and $c/4$ grams of carbohydrate.
As we know that total food calories are given by $180$.
So, $180=\dfrac{p}{4}\times4+\dfrac{f}{9}\times9+\dfrac{c}{4}\times4$.
Simplifying the above equation gives $f=20+5p-5c$.
Therefore, the answer is $f=20+5p-5c$, which is equivalent to option $\textbf{(C)}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
We get that the energy from the protein is $4p$ calories, the energy from the fat is $9f$ calories, and the energy from the carbohydrate is $4c$ calories.  Since these add up to 180 calories, we have $4p+9f+4c=180$.  Solving for $f$, we have $9f=180-4p-4c$, so $f=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 7:
We have:
\begin{align*}
180 &= 4p + 9f + 4c \\
&= 4(p+c) + 5f + 4c \\
5f &= 180 - 4(p+c) - 4c \\
&= 180 - 4(p-c) \\
f &= 20 - \frac{4}{5}(p-c) \\
&= 20 + \frac{4}{5}(c-p).
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)}.$
Response 8:
The number of food calories coming from $p$ grams of protein is $4p$, the number of food calories coming from $f$ grams of fat is $9f$, and the number of food calories coming from $c$ grams of carbohydrate is $4c$. Therefore, we must have $4p+9f+4c = 180$. Solving for $f$, we get $9f = 180-4p-4c$, so $f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 9:
We have $180 = 4p + 9f + 4c$. Dividing by 9 and rearranging gives $f = -\frac{4}{9}(p-c) + 20 = 20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.  
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.

Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$In the equation above, $k$ is a constant. If $x=9$, what is the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 7
  C: 16
  D: 79
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C") 

Solving for k, we can square both sides of the equation as follows:
$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x &= 0 \\
\sqrt{k+2} &= x \\
k+2 &= x^2 \\
k &= x^2 - 2 \\
k &= 9^2 - 2 \\
k &= 79 \end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the value of $k$ is 79.
Response 1:
Since we are given that $\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$, we can solve for $k$ by squaring both sides of the equation. Doing so, we get:
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{k+2}-x &= 0 \\
\sqrt{k+2} &= x \\
\sqrt{k+2} &= 9 \\
(k+2) &= 81 \\
k &= \boxed{\textbf{(C) }16}
\end{align*}
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation:

$$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$
$$\sqrt{k+2}=x$$
$$(k+2)=x^2$$
$$k = x^2-2$$
Substituting $x=9$ we have $k=79$.
Response 3:
If $\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$, then $\sqrt{k+2}=x$. Squaring both sides gives $k+2=x^2$. If $x=9$, then $k+2=9^2=81$. Therefore, $k=81-2=79$.  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
We can start by squaring both sides of the equation: 

$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\ (\sqrt{k+2}-x)^2 &= 0^2 \\ k+2 - 2x \sqrt{k+2} + x^2 &= 0\\ \end{aligned}$$

Substituting $x=9$ yields: 

$$k+2 - 2(9)\sqrt{k+2} + 9^2 = 0 $$

Simplifying, we get: 

$$k - 154 = -9 \sqrt{k+2}$$

Squaring both sides again: 

$$\begin{aligned} k^2-308k+23716 &= 81(k+2)\\ k^2-308k+23554 &= 0 \end{aligned}$$

We can now use the quadratic formula: 
$$k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} $$ 

where $a=1$, $b=-308$, and $c=23554$. 

Plugging in these values yields:

$$k = \frac{308 \pm \sqrt{308^2 - 4(1)(23554)}}{2(1)} = \frac{308 \pm 10}{2}$$

Therefore, the two solutions are $k=149$ and $k=159$. 

However, if we plug in $k=159$ into the original equation, we get: 

$$\sqrt{159+2}-9\approx 3.006 \neq 0 $$

Therefore, the solution is $k=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }1}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C") 

We start by adding $x$ to each side of the equation. We get:
$$\sqrt{k+2}-x+x=x$$
which simplifies to:
$$\sqrt{k+2}=x$$
Substituting $x=9$, we get:
$$\sqrt{k+2}=9$$
Square both sides of the equation:
$$(\sqrt{k+2})^2=9^2$$
$$k+2 = 81$$
Hence, $k=79$. Therefore, the answer is (C).
Response 6:
Squaring both sides of the equation we get:
$$\begin{aligned} (\sqrt{k+2})^2 &= x^2\\ k+2 &= x^2\\ k &= x^2-2\\ k &= 9^2-2\\ k &= 79 \end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
We can start solving the equation by isolating the $\sqrt{k+2}$ term and then squaring both sides:
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{k+2}-x&=0\\
\sqrt{k+2}&=x\\
k+2&=x^2\\
k&=x^2-2^2\\
k&=77
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is **D: 79**.
Response 8:
Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $k+2=x^2=81$. Thus, $k=81-2=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }16}$.
Response 9:
Squaring both sides of $\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$, we get: 
$$(\sqrt{k+2})^2-2x\sqrt{k+2}+x^2=0$$
$$k+2=x^2$$
Substituting $x=9$, we get:
$$k+2=9^2$$
$$k=79$$

Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To find out the temperature at which the speed of sound wave is closest to 1000 feet per second, we need to minimize the absolute difference between the speed of sound wave and 1000. 

We can define the absolute difference between $a$ and 1000 as $|a-1000|$. 

So, we need to minimize $|a-1000|$. 

Substituting the value of $a$ from the given formula, we get:

$$\begin{aligned}|1,052+1.08 t-1000| &= |52-1.08 t |\end{aligned}$$

To minimize this expression, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $52-1.08t$ as close to zero as possible. 

The closest is achieved when $52-1.08t = 0$, which gives $t \approx 48.1^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. 

Therefore, the answer is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ -48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}}$.

The given equation can be simplified and written as $$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$\Rightarrow 2ax-8x=25$$
$$\Rightarrow (2a-8)x=25$$
For there to be no solutions for $x$, the coefficient of x should be equal to 0. Therefore, we have $2a-8=0$ which gives $a=4$. Thus, the answer is (B) 2.
Response 1:
First, let's simplify the equation:
$$2ax-15=3(x+5)+5(x-1)$$
$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$2ax=8x+25$$
$$x(2a-8)=25$$
$$2a-8=\frac{25}{x}$$

Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, the denominator of the right-hand side cannot be zero. Therefore, $x$ must be either 5 or -5. However, substituting these values into the equation, we find that $2ax-15$ is always odd, while $8x+25$ is always even. Therefore, no value of $a$ will work, and the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B") 

The given equation can be simplified as follows:

$$2ax-15= 3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2ax-15=8x+10$$
$$(2a-8)x=25$$

For no value of $x$ to satisfy the equation $(2a-8)$ should be equal to $0$ i.e.
$$2a-8=0$$
$$2a=8$$
$$a=4$$

Therefore, the value of $a$ is 4. Hence, the correct answer is (C) 4.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B") 

Expanding the right side we have: $2ax - 15 = 3x + 15 + 5x - 5$ which simplifies to: $2ax - 15 = 8x + 10$. Rearranging the equation and factoring gives: $(2a-8)x=25$. Since no value of x satisfies the equation, $2a-8$ can't be zero; so, $a=4$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")  

We simplify the equation by expanding the right side: $$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5.$$Simplifying the right side gives: $$2ax-15=8x+10.$$Bringing all the $x$-terms to one side gives: $$2ax-8x=15+10.$$Factoring out the $x$ gives: $$x(2a-8)=25.$$For this equation to have no solution in $x$, we must have $2a-8=0$, which gives $a=\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ 2}.$
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")  
Solution: Simplifying both sides of the equation, we get $$2ax-15=8x+10.$$Therefore, $$(2a-8)x=25.$$Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, then $2a-8$ must be equal to $0$ (otherwise we could solve for $x$). Thus, $a=4.$
Response 8:
First, we distribute on the right side of the equation to get $2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$. Combining like terms gives $2ax-15=8x+10$. Rearranging further, we have $(2a-8)x=25$. Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, $2a-8\neq0$. Solving for $a$, we have $a=4$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")  

The given equation can be simplified as, 

$$2ax - 15 = 8x + 10$$

$$\Rightarrow 2ax - 8x = 25$$

$$\Rightarrow x(2a - 8) = 25$$

For the given equation to have no solution, the term $(2a - 8)$ must be equal to 0. 

$$2a - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow a = 4$$

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The function $f$ is defined by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$. The graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following intervals contains the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-4<x<-3$
  B: $-3<x<1$
  C: $1<x<3$
  D: $3<x<4$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("-2")  

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola defined by the function $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ can be found by completing the square or using the vertex formula. Using the vertex formula, we have $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{(1+3)}{2(1)}=-2$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$. Since $-4<x<-3$ is the interval containing $-2$, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)} -4<x<-3}$.
Response 1:
To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of $f(x)$, we can first convert $f(x)$ into vertex form. We start by expanding the original expression for $f(x)$:

$$f(x)=x^2+4x+3$$

We can then complete the square to obtain the vertex form:

$$f(x)=(x+2)^2-1$$

Thus, we see that the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$.
The choice containing $-2$ is (B), so the answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("-2") 

Solution:
We can start by expanding the given expression:
$$f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$$
We can also rewrite $f$ in vertex form by completing the square:
$$f(x)=x^2+4x+3=(x+2)^2-1$$
Therefore, the vertex is at the point $(-2,-1)$, which has an $x$-coordinate of $-2$. This value lies in interval (A).
Response 3:
Action: Answer("-2") 

Explanation:
To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola, we use the formula $x=-\dfrac{b}{2a}$, where $ax^2+bx+c$ is the quadratic function. In this case, we have $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$. Thus, $x=-\dfrac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Since $-4<-2<-3$, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("-2")  

The vertex of a parabola of the form $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$ is at $(h,k)$.

We can expand $f(x)$ to get $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. Completing the square, we have $f(x)=(x+2)^2-1$. Thus, the vertex is at $(-2,-1)$.

Since $-4<-2<-3$, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is in the interval $(-4,-3)$, which corresponds to choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("-2")  

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the given quadratic function $f(x)$, we need to use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic term and linear term, respectively. Expanding $f(x)$, we get $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$ and $b=4$. Thus, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Since $-4<x<-3$, we choose answer choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("-1")  

We can rewrite $f$ as $f(x) = x^2 + 4x +3$. To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, we can use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic term and the linear term, respectively. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$, so $x=-\frac{4}{2\times1}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not one of the given choices, but rather $x=-2$, which is not in any of the intervals listed.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("-1")  

The vertex of the parabola of $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ is at $x=\frac{-(3+1)}{2}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not among the given options.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$, we use $h$ as the $x$-value of the vertex, so the answer is $(-3+(-1))/2=-2$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("-2") 

Explanation: 
The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola defined by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ is given by $x_{\text{vertex}}=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2}= -2$. The answer is not listed as a choice, but the closest interval that contains $-2$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } -4<x<-3}$.

Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
We are given the equation $0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y),$ and the fact that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution. Let $a$ denote the amount in milliliters of the $10 \%$ saline solution. We want to solve for $a.$ Since Clayton uses $100$ milliliters of the $20 \%$ saline solution, he must use $a + 100$ milliliters of saline solution in total. Substituting this expression for $x + y$ in the equation $0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y),$ we have $0.10 a+20 = 0.18(a + 100).$ Simplifying the right side gives $0.18 a + 18,$ so $0.08 a = 2,$ and $a = 25.$

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Multiplying both sides of the equation by $100$, we have $$10x+20y=18(x+y) \Rightarrow 10x+20y=18x+18y.$$We can simplify this to get $$2x=2y \Rightarrow x=y.$$We know that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, so he must use an equal amount of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution. Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 100}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution. 

You can also check this answer by calculating the resulting percentage of saline by mass: $$0.1 \cdot 100 + 0.2 \cdot 100 = 0.18 \cdot 200.$$So the percentage of saline by mass in the final mixture is indeed $18 \%$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
First, we substitute $y = 100$ into the equation given in the question to get $$0.10x + 0.20(100) = 0.18(x + 100).$$Simplifying this equation, we get $$0.10x + 20 = 0.18x + 18,$$which gives $$0.08x = 2.$$Therefore, $$x = \frac{2}{0.08} = 25.$$Thus, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }25}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ saline solution.
Response 5:
First, we will substitute $y=100$ into the equation. Then, we will solve for $x$.
\begin{align*}
0.10x+0.20(100)&=0.18(x+100)\\
0.10x+20&=0.18x+18\\
0.08x&=2\\
x&=25
\end{align*}
Therefore, Clayton must mix $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }25}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")  
Let $x$ represent the number of milliliters of the $10 \%$ saline solution. We know that Clayton used $100$ milliliters of the $20 \%$ saline solution, so $y=100$. Substituting this into the given equation, we have $$0.1x + 0.2 \cdot 100 = 0.18(x + 100).$$Simplifying, we get $0.1x + 20 = 0.18x + 18$, or $0.08x = 2$. Therefore, $x = \frac{2}{0.08} = 25$. So Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 25}$ milliliters of the $10\%$ saline solution.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We are given that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the 20% saline solution. 
Let's substitute this into the equation. 
$$0.10x+0.20\times 100 = 0.18(x+100)$$
Simplifying the equation, we have
$$0.10x+20 = 0.18x+18$$
$$0.08x=2$$
$$x=25$$
Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 25}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ saline solution.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can start by substituting in $y=100$ into the given equation: $$0.10 x+0.20 \cdot 100=0.18(x+100)$$ Simplifying this equation gives us: $$0.10 x+20=0.18x+18$$ Then, we can solve for $x$: $$0.08x=2$$ $$x=25$$ Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 50}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's start by finding how many hours Lani spent in meetings.

Action: Answer("C")

$15 \%$ of 8 hours is equal to $0.15 \times 8 = 1.2$ hours.

To convert hours to minutes, we can multiply by 60.

$1.2 \times 60 = 72$ minutes.

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.
Response 2:
To solve the problem, we first convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by $100$: $15\% = 0.15$. 

To find out how much time Lani spent in meetings, we multiply the decimal by the total time of 8 hours and then convert the result to minutes: 

$0.15 \times 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}} = 72$ minutes.

The results are summarized in the table above. If one of the surgeons is selected at random, which of the following is closest to the probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research?
Choices:
  A: 0.122
  B: 0.196
  C: 0.318
  D: 0.379
Response 0:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is:

(74/607) ≈ 0.122 (rounded to three decimal places)

So, the closest option is (A) 0.122.
 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Out of the 607 surgeons, 230 indicated their major professional activity as research. Out of these 230, 74 were orthopedic surgeons. 

So the probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is 74/607.

To find the answer closest to this probability, we can approximate 74/607:

74/607 is approximately 0.122 (rounded to the nearest thousandth).

Therefore, the closest answer is **(A) 0.122)**.
Response 2:
The total number of orthopedic surgeons whose indicated professional activity is research is 74. Therefore, the probability of selecting such surgeon is $\frac{74}{607} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0.122}$.
Response 3:
The probability required is the ratio of the number of orthopedic surgeons who are into research to the total number of surgeons. Therefore, 

Probability = $\frac{74}{607}$

This can be simplified to,

Probability = $\frac{2}{23}\approx0.087$

Since $0.087$ is closest to $0.122$, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is given by the ratio:
$$\frac{\text{Number of orthopedic surgeons conducting research}}{\text{Total number of surgeons}}=\frac{74}{607}\approx 0.122$$
So the closest answer is (A) 0.122. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Out of the total sample of $607$ surgeons, $193$ are orthopedic surgeons. Out of these $193$ orthopedic surgeons, $74$ indicated their major professional activity as research. Therefore, the probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is $\frac{74}{607} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(A) } 0.122}$.
Response 6:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is $74/607$ which is approximately $0.12$. 

So, Answer: A
Response 7:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is:
$$ \frac{74}{607} \approx 0.122 $$
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Out of the 607 surgeons, 230 indicated their professional activity as research. Out of 193 orthopedic surgeons, 74 indicated research as their professional activity. Therefore, the probability of a surgeon being an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is:
$$\frac{\text{Number of orthopedic surgeons who indicated research as professional activity}}{\text{Total number of surgeons who indicated research as professional activity}}=\frac{74}{230}\approx0.322\approx\boxed{\textbf{(C) }0.318}$$
Response 9:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{Number of Orthopedic Surgeons Conducting Research}}{\text{Total Number of Surgeons}} &= \frac{74}{607} \\
&\approx \frac{1}{8} \\
&\approx \frac{12.5}{100} \\
&= 0.125
\end{align*}
The answer that is closest to 0.125 is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0.122}$.

Question: If $20-x=15$, what is the value of $3 x ?$
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 10
  C: 15
  D: 35
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can start solving for $x$ by isolating it on one side:
$$20-x=15$$
$$\Rightarrow 20-15=x$$
$$\Rightarrow 5=x$$
Therefore, 
$$3x=3\times 5=15$$
Hence, the answer is $\textbf{(C)}\ 15$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")  
Solution: 

$20-x=15$

$20−15=x$

$5=x$

$3x=3*5=15$
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
$20-x=15$
$-x = 15- 20$
$x= -5$

$3x=3(-5)=-15$

Therefore, the answer is A: $5$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")  
Solution: 

$20 - x = 15$

$-x = 15-20$

$x=5$

Therefore, $3x = 3 \times 5 = 15$.

Hence, the answer is (C) $15$.
Response 4:
The given equation is $20-x=15$
Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get $20-15 = x$ or $5=x$
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get $3x = 3(5) = 15$
Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D") 

Solution: 

$20-x=15$ 

$\Rightarrow x=20-15=5$ 

Hence, $3x=3\times 5=\boxed{15}$
Response 7:
Solution:
Simplifying the given equation by subtracting $15$ from both sides gives $20 - x - 15 = 0,$ or $5 - x = 0$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 5$.

Multiplying $x$ by $3$ gives $3x = 3 \times 5 = 15$.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")  

Explanation: 
$20-x=15$ can be written as $x=20-15=5$. 
Multiplying 5 by 3 gives us $3x=3 \cdot 5=15$. 
Therefore, the answer is (D) 35.
Response 9:
To solve the equation, we will add both sides by $x$ to get rid of the negative term on the left-hand side of the equation, which leads to:
$$
\begin{aligned} 20-x+ x &=15+x \\ 20 &=15+x \\ 20-15 &= x \\ 5 &= x \end{aligned}
$$
So, $x=5$. Therefore, $3x=3\times5=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 15}$. Answer: Answer("B").

The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
Let's find the slope of the line that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price. The slope of a line passing through two points, $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, is given by $$m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}.$$ For this question, we can choose any two points from the table, and we will get the same slope. Let's choose $(128,950)$ and $(176,1310)$. The slope is then $$m=\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=6.5.$$ Thus, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is given by $$r(p)=6.5p+b,$$ where $b$ is the $y$-intercept of the line. We can find $b$ by substituting the coordinates of any point on the line. Let's use $(128,950)$: $$950=6.5(128)+b,$$ which gives $b=-440$. Therefore, the linear function is $$r(p)=6.5p-440.$$ Converting the purchase price back from thousands of dollars to dollars, we have $$r(p)=6.5\times 1000p-440=6500p-440.$$ The correct function is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ r(p)=2.5 p-870}$.
Response 1:
We need to find a linear function of the form $r(p) = ap+b$ that will relate the monthly rental price with the purchase price of the property. We can find the slope, $a$, by calculating the change in rental price over the change in purchase price: 

$$a = \frac{\Delta r}{\Delta p} = \frac{\text{change in rental price}}{\text{change in purchase price}}$$

From the table, we can see that when the purchase price increases by $1,000, the rental price increases by $7.5 \times 100 = 750$. Therefore, $a = 7.5$. 

To find $b$, we can plug in one of the data points. Let's use the first row of the table: $p = 128$ and $r = 950$. 

$$r(p) = ap + b$$
$$950 = 7.5(128) + b$$
$$b = 950 - 7.5(128) = 10$$

So the linear function is $r(p) = 7.5p + 10$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate of change of the monthly rental price with respect to the purchase price. The slope is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. From the data, we can find two points: $(128,000, 950)$ and $(176,000, 1,310)$. The change in rental price is $1,310-950=360$ and the change in purchase price is $176-128=48$. Thus, the slope is $\frac{360}{48}=7.5$. The y-intercept is the rental price when the purchase price is 0, which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
The function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price should have the form $r(p)=mp+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. We need to find the values of $m$ and $b$. 

If we look at the table, we can see that when the purchase price increases by $1,000$, the monthly rental price increases by a certain amount. This means that the slope is the same as the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. For example, for the Clearwater Lane property, when the purchase price increases from $128,000$ to $129,000$, the rental price increases from $950$ to $982.50$. So the slope is $\frac{982.50-950}{129-128} = 32.50$. 

To find the $y$-intercept, we can use any point on the line. Let's use the Edgemont Street property, which has a purchase price of $70,000$ and a rental price of $515$. Plugging in $p=70$ and $r=515$ into our equation gives $515=70m+b$, so $b=515-70m$. 

Now we can plug in the slope we found to get $b=515-70(32.50)=-1225$, so the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price is $r(p)=32.50p-1225$. 

Converting this to the form $r(p)=mp+b$ gives $r(p)=32.50p-1225 = 32.5p + (-1225)$, so the slope is $m=32.5$ and the $y$-intercept is $b=-1225$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(A) } r(p)=2.5p-870$.
Response 4:
We can solve this problem by using the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. We can find the slope ($m$) by using the two given data points $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$, where $p$ represents the horizontal axis and $r$ represents the vertical axis. 

\begin{align*}
m &= \frac{\text{change in } r}{\text{change in } p} \\
&= \frac{3365-950}{450-128} \\
&= \frac{2415}{322} \\
&= 7.5
\end{align*}

Now that we know the slope is 7.5, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the y-intercept ($b$) using the point $(128, 950)$.

\begin{align*}
r - 950 &= 7.5(p - 128) \\
r &= 7.5p - 870
\end{align*}

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is $r(p)=7.5p-870$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
The slope of the line represents the amount of change in monthly rental price per change in purchase price (in thousands of dollars). To find the slope, we can calculate the change in rental price and divide it by the change in purchase price. Using the values for the two most expensive properties, we get:

slope = change in rental price / change in purchase price
      = (3,365 - 1,310) / (450 - 176)
      = 2,055 / 274
      = 7.5

So the slope of the line is 7.5. We can also find the y-intercept by plugging in one of our data points and solving for b:

1,310 = 7.5(176) + b
b = -470

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price and property purchase price is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 470$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }r(p)=7.5 p-470}$
Response 6:
To find the linear function with the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price, we need to find the slope ($m$) and the y-intercept ($b$). The slope is equal to the change in $r$ divided by the change in $p$. From the table, we can see that if we increase the property price by $1000, the monthly rental price always increase by some amount. For example, if we increase the price by $1000 from Clearwater Lane to Driftwood Drive, the rental price increases by $310. Since we are measuring the property price in thousands of dollars, this means the slope is $m=\frac{310}{176-128}=5$. To find the y-intercept, we can use one of the points from the table, such as Clearwater Lane, which has a price of $p=128$ and a rental price of $r=950$. Plugging this into the slope-intercept form $y=mx+b$, we get $950=5(128)+b$, which simplifies to $b=-870$. Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$ is $r(p)=5p-870$, which is (A). 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
To find the equation of the line in slope-intercept form $y=mx+b$ where $y=r(p)$ and $x=p$, we need to find the slope and the intercept. 

We can find the slope $m$ by selecting any two data points $(p_1, r(p_1))$ and $(p_2, r(p_2))$ and using the formula $m=\dfrac{r(p_2)-r(p_1)}{p_2-p_1}$. Let's use the data points $(128,950)$ and $(176,1310)$:

$m=\dfrac{1310-950}{176-128}=\dfrac{360}{48}=7.5$

So the slope of the line is $m=7.5$.

To find the y-intercept $b$, we can choose any data point on the line and substitute the known values for $m$, $x$, and $y$ into the equation $y=mx+b$ to solve for $b$. Let's use the data point $(128,950)$:

$950=7.5(128)+b$

$950=960+b$

$b=-10$

So the y-intercept of the line is $b=-10$.

Therefore, the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is $r(p)=7.5p-10$, which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$.
Response 8:
To find the relationship between $r$ and $p$, we need to find the equation of the line that passes through two points on the line. We can use the coordinates for two properties from the table, say $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$. Let us first convert the purchase price from thousands of dollars to just dollars. Thus, we get $(128000, 950)$ and $(176000, 1310)$. The slope of the line passing through these points is $\frac{1310-950}{176000-128000}=0.005$. Therefore, the equation of the line, in slope-intercept form, is $r(p) = 0.005p + b$. Now, to find $b$, we can use one of the points on the line, say $(128000, 950)$. Thus, we have $950 = 0.005(128000)+b$, which gives us $b=290$. Therefore, the equation for the line is $r(p) = 0.005p + 290$, which simplifies to $r(p) = 5p+165$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
We are given that "the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function." So, we need to find the equation of the line that passes through two points from the table. Let's choose the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$ (remembering that $p$ is measured in thousands of dollars). 

First, we need to calculate the slope of the line: $$m=\frac{\text{change in }r}{\text{change in }p}=\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=8$$

Now that we know the slope $m=8$, we can determine the $y$-intercept $b$ using the point-slope form of the equation of a line: \begin{align*}
r-950&=8(p-128)\\
r&=8p-2
\end{align*}

Topic: Math
Question: To make a bakery's signature chocolate muffins, a baker needs 2.5 ounces of chocolate for each muffin. How many pounds of chocolate are needed to make 48 signature chocolate muffins?( 1 pound $=16$ ounces)
Choices:
  A: 7.5
  B: 10
  C: 50.5
  D: 120
Response 0:
We can use unit conversion to solve this problem. Since 1 pound $= 16$ ounces, we can convert 2.5 ounces to pounds by dividing 2.5 by 16. Next, we can multiply the amount of chocolate needed for one muffin (2.5 ounces divided by 16) by the number of muffins we want to make (48) to find the total amount of chocolate needed in ounces. Finally, we can convert back to pounds by dividing by 16. 

Action: Answer("A") 

To be precise, the calculation is as follows:

$2.5\text{ ounces} \div 16 = 0.15625\text{ pounds of chocolate per muffin}$ 

$0.15625\text{ pounds per muffin}\times 48= 7.5\text{ pounds of chocolate}$
Response 1:
Solution:
To make one muffin, it requires 2.5 ounces of chocolate.
To make 48 muffins, it requires 2.5 x 48 = 120 ounces.
1 pound = 16 ounces
Therefore, 120 ounces is equal to 120/16 = 7.5 pounds of chocolate.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
To make 1 muffin, the baker needs 2.5 ounces of chocolate. 

Therefore, to make 48 muffins, the baker needs 2.5 x 48 = 120 ounces of chocolate. 

Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the baker needs 120/16 = 7.5 pounds of chocolate.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
To make one muffin, 2.5 ounces of chocolate are required. 

To make 48 muffins, we need 48 times the amount required for one muffin. 

Total chocolate = $2.5\text{ ounces/muffin} \times 48 \text{ muffins}$ 

Total chocolate = $120$ ounces 

Total chocolate in pounds = $\dfrac{120 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}$ 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
First we need to find out the amount of chocolate required to make 48 muffins: 

$48 \text{ muffins} \times 2.5 \frac{\text{ounces of chocolate}}{\text{muffin}} = 120 \text{ ounces of chocolate}$ 

Then we convert the ounces to pounds: 

$120\text{ ounces of chocolate} \times \frac{1 \text{ pound}}{16\text{ ounces}} = 7.5\text{ pounds}$ 

Therefore, the amount of chocolate required to make 48 signature chocolate muffins is 7.5 pounds. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Firstly, we need to find out how many ounces of chocolate are needed to make 48 muffins. 
- 2.5 ounces of chocolate are needed to make one muffin.
- Therefore, 2.5 x 48 = 120 ounces of chocolate are needed to make 48 muffins.
- But, we need to express the answer in pounds, so we need to convert 120 ounces to pounds.
- 1 pound = 16 ounces, so 120 ounces = 120/16 = 7.5 pounds
Thus, the answer is A: 7.5.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
To make one chocolate muffin, the baker needs 2.5 ounces of chocolate.
To make 48 muffins, the baker needs 48 * 2.5 = 120 ounces of chocolate.
Now, we convert ounces to pounds by dividing by 16.
So, the baker needs 120/16 = 7.5 pounds of chocolate.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
To make 1 muffin, the baker needs 2.5 ounces of chocolate. 

To make 48 muffins, the baker would need: 

$2.5 \text{ ounces/muffin} \cdot 48 \text{ muffins} = 120 \text{ ounces}$ 

To convert ounces to pounds, we divide by 16: 

$120 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/pound} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}$ 

So the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
To make one muffin, the baker needs 2.5 ounces of chocolate. To make 48 muffins, the baker needs $2.5 \times 48 = 120$ ounces of chocolate. 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces. So, $120 \text{ ounces}= \frac{120}{16} \text{ pounds}= 7.5$ pounds of chocolate.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Nate walks 25 meters in 13.7 seconds. If he walks at this same rate, which of the following is closest to the distance he will walk in 4 minutes?
Choices:
  A: 150 meters
  B: 450 meters
  C: 700 meters
  D: 1,400 meters
Response 0:
To solve the problem, we need to first calculate Nate’s walking speed in meters per second, and then multiply this by the number of seconds in 4 minutes.

Calculating Nate's walking speed: 

Speed = distance/time 

Speed = 25 meters/13.7 seconds 

Speed ≈ 1.82 meters per second 

Multiplying Nate's speed by the number of seconds in 4 minutes:

Distance = speed x time 

Distance = 1.82 meters per second x 240 seconds (4 minutes = 240 seconds)

Distance ≈ 436 meters 

Therefore, the closest answer is Choice B: 450 meters. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
To convert seconds to minutes we divide by 60. Therefore he walks 25m/13.7s = 1.8255 m/s  
To calculate the distance he walks in four minutes, we need to multiply his speed by the time; 1.8255 m/s * 4 minutes * 60 seconds = 438.12 meters.  
Therefore, the closest answer is Answer("B") 450 meters.
Response 3:
We can use dimensional analysis to first convert 4 minutes to seconds:
4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds

Then, we can set up a proportion to solve for the distance Nate will walk:
25 meters/13.7 seconds = x meters/240 seconds

Simplifying this proportion, we get:
x = (25 meters/13.7 seconds) * 240 seconds
x = 438.96 meters

Rounding to the nearest choice, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C") 700 meters
Response 4:
We can start by calculating Nate's speed: 

Speed = Distance ÷ Time

Speed = 25 meters ÷ 13.7 seconds

Speed ≈ 1.82 meters per second 

To find out how far Nate will walk in 4 minutes (or 240 seconds), we can use the formula: 

Distance = Speed × Time 

Distance = 1.82 meters per second × 240 seconds 

Distance ≈ 436 meters 

Therefore, the closest answer to the distance Nate will walk in 4 minutes is:

Action: Answer("B")  (450 meters)
Response 5:
First, we need to find Nate's rate:
25 meters ÷ 13.7 seconds ≈ 1.8248 meters per second

Now we can use the rate to find how far he will walk in 4 minutes:
4 minutes = 240 seconds
240 seconds × 1.8248 meters per second ≈ 437.95 meters

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To solve this problem, we can first find Nate's speed in meters per second.
25 meters / 13.7 seconds ≈ 1.82 meters per second

Then, we can use this speed to find the distance he will walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds).
1.82 meters per second × 240 seconds = 436.8 meters

Since the problem asks for the closest answer, we can round 436.8 meters to the nearest hundred, which is 400 meters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
To solve this problem, we can start by finding Nate's speed in meters per second:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 25 meters / 13.7 seconds
Speed ≈ 1.8248 meters per second

Next, we can use this to find the distance Nate will walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds):
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 1.8248 meters per second x 240 seconds
Distance ≈ 437.952 meters

Therefore, the closest answer is:

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& b=2.35+0.25 x \\& c=1.75+0.40 x\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ represent the price per pound, in dollars, of beef and chicken, respectively, $x$ weeks after July 1 during last summer. What was the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 2.60$
  B: $\$ 2.85$
  C: $\$ 2.95$
  D: $\$ 3.35$
Response 0:
We want to find the value of $x$ that makes $b=c$. Therefore, we can set the two equations equal to one another and solve for $x$: 
$$2.35+0.25x = 1.75+0.4x$$
$$0.15x=0.6$$
$$x=4$$
Now that we know $x=4$, we can find the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken by plugging in $x=4$ into either equation. Using $b=2.35+0.25x$, we get:
$$b=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \$2.85}.$$
Response 1:
We are given that $b=c$, so we can equate the two given equations and solve for $x$. $$\begin{aligned} 2.35+0.25x&=1.75+0.40x\\ 0.15x&=0.60\\ x&=4 \end{aligned}$$ Now, we can substitute this value of $x$ in either of the two given equations to get the answer. $$b=2.35+0.25x=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$$ Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$
Response 2:
Given, $b=2.35+0.25 x$ and $c=1.75+0.40 x$ are the price of beef and chicken respectively for $x$ weeks with regard to July 1.

Let's equate both prices: $$\begin{aligned}2.35+0.25x &= 1.75+0.40x\\ 0.15x &= 0.6\\ x &= 4\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, we have $b=2.35+0.25\times4 = 2.35+1 =\boxed{\textbf{(C)} \: \$2.95}$ as the price of beef per pound when it is same as the price of chicken.
Response 3:
We are given:

$b=2.35+0.25 x$

$c=1.75+0.40 x$

We set $b$ equal to $c$ and solve for $x$:

$2.35+0.25 x=1.75+0.40 x$

$0.15 x=0.60$

$x=4$

So, when $x=4$, $b=c=2.35+0.25(4)=3.35$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } \$ 3.35}$.
Response 4:
We need to find the value of $x$ for which $b=c$, and then substitute that value of $x$ to find the price per pound of beef. So, set $b=c$ and solve for $x$:$$\begin{aligned}2.35+0.25x&=1.75+0.40x \\0.15x&=0.60 \\x&=4\end{aligned}$$Now substitute $x=4$ into the equation for $b$:$$b=2.35+0.25x=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\$ 2.35}$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\$ 2.35}$.
Response 5:
We are given that $b$ and $c$ are the prices per pound of beef and chicken respectively, in dollars, $x$ weeks after July 1 during last summer. We want to find the value of $b$ when $b = c$. For simplicity, we can set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for $x$. We get \begin{align*}
2.35+0.25 x  &= 1.75+0.40 x \\
0.10 x &= 0.60 \\
x &= 6.
\end{align*}

Thus, the prices are equal 6 weeks after July 1. To find the price per pound at this time, we simply substitute $x=6$ into either equation and solve for the value of $b = c$. We get \begin{align*}
b=2.35+0.25 \cdot 6 = 3.95
\end{align*}
Therefore, the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken was $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$
Response 6:
We want to find when $b=c$, so we can set the two equations to equal each other and solve for $x$. $$2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$$ $$0.15x=0.6$$ $$x=4$$ Now we know that the prices are the same 4 weeks after July 1. We can plug in $x=4$ to either equation to find the price per pound. $$b=2.35+0.25\times4=2.35+1=3.35$$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(D)}\ \$3.35}$.
Response 7:
We will equate $b$ and $c$ and then solve for $x$.
$$\begin{aligned} 2.35+0.25 x &= 1.75+0.40 x \\ 0.10 x &= 0.60 \\ x &= 6 \end{aligned}$$
The price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken is
$$b = 2.35+0.25 x = 2.35+0.25 \cdot 6 = \boxed{\mathrm{(C) \ } \$ 2.95}.$$
Response 8:
We need to find the value of x when $b=c$, then we can substitute this value into one of the equations to find the price per pound of beef. 

$$\begin{aligned} 2.35+0.25x &= 1.75+0.4x \\
0.15x &= 0.6 \\
x &= 4
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, when the price per pound of beef was equal to the price per pound of chicken, it was 4 weeks after July 1. We can then substitute this value into one of the equations to find the price per pound of beef:

$$b = 2.35+0.25\times 4 = 2.35+1 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$$

Question: Survey Results\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\hlineAnswer & Percent \\\hlineNever & $31.3 \%$ \\\hlineRarely & $24.3 \%$ \\\hlineOften & $13.5 \%$ \\\hlineAlways & $30.9 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the results of a survey in which tablet users were asked how often they would watch video advertisements in order to access streaming content for free. Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
Response 0:
Let's call the event that a user answered "Always" A, and the event that a user did not answer "Never" B. We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that a user answered "Always" given that they did not answer "Never." 

Using Bayes' theorem, we have: 

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that P(A) = 0.309, since that is the percentage of users who answered "Always" in the entire survey. 

To find P(B), we need to add up the percentages of users who did not answer "Never" for each category: 

P(B) = 24.3% + 13.5% + 30.9% = 68.7% 

To find P(B|A), we need to look at the percentage of users who did not answer "Never" among those who answered "Always": 

P(B|A) = 100% - 31.3% = 68.7% 

Now we have all the pieces we need to calculate P(A|B): 

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 68.7% * 0.309 / 68.7% = 0.309 

So the closest answer is (A) 0.31. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let's denote the event that the tablet user answered "Always" as $A$ and the event that the tablet user did not answer "Never" as $B$. We want to find $P(A|B)$. Using Bayes' Theorem:
\begin{align*}
P(A|B) &= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\
&= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|\sim A)P(\sim A)} \\
&= \frac{(1)(0.309)}{(1)(0.309)+(0.657)(0.691)} \\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 0.38}
\end{align*}
Response 2:
Let $N$, $R$, $O$, and $A$ represent the events that a tablet user answered "Never," "Rarely," "Often," and "Always," respectively. Also, let $C$ represent the event that a tablet user did not respond "Never." Then, we are looking for the conditional probability $P(A|C)$. Using Bayes' theorem, we have \begin{align*}P(A|C)&=\dfrac{P(C|A)P(A)}{P(C|N)P(N)+P(C|R)P(R)+P(C|O)P(O)+P(C|A)P(A)}\\&=\dfrac{(1-0.309)(0.309)}{(1-0.313)(0.313)+(1-0.243)(0.243)+(1-0.135)(0.135)+(1-0.309)(0.309)}\\&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.38}\end{align*}
Response 3:
Let $A$ be the event that the tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that the user did not answer "Never". We can use the formula for conditional probability:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

Since the user did not answer "Never", it means that they fall into one of the categories "Rarely," "Often," or "Always." So the probability of $B$ occurring is:

$$P(B) = P(\text{Rarely}) + P(\text{Often}) + P(\text{Always}) = 0.243 + 0.135 + 0.309 = 0.687$$

To calculate the probability of $A \cap B$, we need to use the fact that the percentages in the table add up to 100:

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) - P(\text{Always and Never}) = 0.309 - 0 = 0.309$$

So the conditional probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never," is:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.449 \approx \boxed{\textbf{(C) }0.45}$$
Response 4:
Let A be the event that a tablet user answered "Always", and let B be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never".  We can use the formula for conditional probability:
\[ P(A | B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}. \]Since every tablet user did answer either "Never," "Rarely," "Often," or "Always," we can re-write $P(B)$ as the complement of the probability that a tablet user answered "Never":
\begin{align*}
P(B) &= P(\text{not Never}) \\
&= 1 - P(\text{Never}) \\
&= 1 - 0.313 \\
&= 0.687.
\end{align*}To find $P(A \cap B)$, we use the fact that the percentages in the table add up to 100\%:
\begin{align*}
P(A \cap B) &= P(A) - P(\text{Always and Never}) \\
&= 0.309 - 0 \\
&= 0.309.
\end{align*}Therefore,
\[ P(A | B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \dfrac{0.309}{0.687} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 0.45}. \]
Response 5:
Let A denote the event "a tablet user answered 'Always'," and let B denote the event "a tablet user did not answer 'Never'." We want to find P(A|B), the conditional probability of A, given B. Using the formula for conditional probability, we have:

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

Let's first find P(B), the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never." This is equal to 100% - 31.3% = 68.7%, or 0.687.

To find P(A and B), the probability that a tablet user answered "Always" and did not answer "Never," we look at the table and see that 30.9% of tablet users answered "Always" and 31.3% answered "Never," so the percentage who answered "Always" and did not answer "Never" is 30.9% - 31.3% = -0.4%. This is a nonsensical result, because we can't have a negative percentage. It's likely that there was some kind of error in the survey data or in the formatting of the table.

Since we can't find a reasonable value for P(A and B), we can't calculate P(A|B) either. Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Response 6:
We are given that a tablet user did not answer "Never". Therefore, out of the total respondents, only the percentages of "Rarely," "Often," and "Always" matter. 

Let $R$, $O$, and $A$ be the events that the tablet user answers "Rarely," "Often," and "Always," respectively. Then, we are looking for $P(A| \sim N)$, where $\sim N$ means "not Never". By Bayes' Theorem,

$$P(A| \sim N)=\frac{P(\sim N|A)P(A)}{P(\sim N|A)P(A)+P(\sim N|O)P(O)+P(\sim N|R)P(R)}$$

Since the question does not ask for a specific value (only an approximation), we can use rough estimates from the table. 

$P(A)=0.309$ and $P(\sim N)=0.687$ (the sum of "Rarely," "Often," and "Always" percentages)
\begin{align*}
&P(\sim N|A)=1\\
&P(\sim N|O)=\frac{1-0.135}{1-0.313}=0.69\\
&P(\sim N|R)=\frac{1-0.243}{1-0.313}=0.826
\end{align*}

Plugging these estimates into the formula gives:

$$P(A| \sim N)=\frac{1\cdot 0.309}{1\cdot 0.309+0.69\cdot 0.135+0.826\cdot 0.243} \approx \frac{0.309}{0.309+0.093+0.201} \approx \frac{0.309}{0.603} \approx 0.512 \approx \boxed{\textbf{(none of the above)}}$$

Therefore, the closest answer is "none of the above."
Response 7:
Let's call the event of a tablet user answering "Always" as $A$ and the event of a tablet user not answering "Never" as $B$. We want to find $P(A|B)$. We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate this:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

We know that $P(A)=0.309$ and $P(B)=1-P(\text{Never})=1-0.313=0.687$. 

To find $P(B|A)$, we need to look at the percentages of those who answered "Always" and "Never" and find the percentage of "Always" out of the non-"Never" responses:

$$P(B|A) = \frac{0.309}{1-0.313} \approx 0.449$$

So putting it all together: 

$$P(A|B) = \frac{0.449 \times 0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.201$$

Therefore, the closest answer choice is B: 0.38.
Response 8:
Let's call the event of a tablet user answering "Always" given that they did not answer "Never" as event $A$. We want to calculate the conditional probability $P(A)$. 

First, we need to find the total percentage of users who did not answer "Never." This is $100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$. 

Next, we need to find the percentage of users who answered "Always" and did not answer "Never." This is $30.9 \%$. 

So, $P(A) = \frac{\text{Percentage of users who answered Always and did not answer Never}}{\text{Percentage of users who did not answer Never}} \approx \frac{30.9 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.45$. 

Therefore, the closest choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}$.
Response 9:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always," and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B),$ which means "the probability of $A$ given $B.$" We know that $P(A)=0.309$ and $P(\text{Never})=0.313,$ so $P(\text{Not Never})=1-P(\text{Never})=0.687.$ Using Bayes' Theorem, we find that $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}=\frac{P(A)}{P(B)}\qquad\qquad(\bigstar)$$ since $P(B|A)=1.$

Now, we need to find $P(B).$ This means "the probability that a tablet user did not answer 'Never'." Using the Law of Total Probability (or just common sense), we find $$P(B)=P(\text{Rarely})+P(\text{Often})+P(\text{Always})=0.243+0.135+0.309=0.687.$$ Substituting into $(\bigstar),$ we get $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A)}{P(B)}=\frac{0.309}{0.687}\approx0.449.$$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}.$

Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")  
To solve the system of equations, we can multiply the first equation by $3$ and the second equation by $2$ to get $$\begin{aligned}& 6x-9y=-42 \\& 6 x-4 y=-12\end{aligned}$$ Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have $-5y=-30$ or $y=6.$ Substituting in either equation gives $x=0.$ Therefore, $x-y=-6.$ The correct answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ -8}.$
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")  

To solve the system of equations, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and multiply the second equation by 3, and then add the two equations to eliminate $y$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2(2x-3y) = 2(-14) \quad &&\text{(Multiply the first equation by 2)} \\
& 3(3x-2y) = 3(-6)  \quad &&\text{(Multiply the second equation by 3)} \\
\Longrightarrow & \quad 4x - 6y = -28 \\
& \quad 9x - 6y = -18 \\
\Longrightarrow & \quad 13x = -10 \\
\Longrightarrow & \quad x = \frac{-10}{13} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
Substitute $x = -\frac{10}{13}$ into the first equation to solve for $y$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
2x - 3y &= -14 \\
\Longrightarrow 2\left(-\frac{10}{13}\right) - 3y &= -14 \\
\Longrightarrow -\frac{20}{13} - 3y &= -14 \\
\Longrightarrow -3y &= -\frac{182}{13} \\
\Longrightarrow y &= \frac{182}{39} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
Therefore, $x-y = -\frac{10}{13} - \frac{182}{39} = -\frac{20}{39} - \frac{182}{39} = -\frac{202}{39}$. Simplifying, we get $x-y = -4\frac{2}{39}$, which is closest to answer choice (C) -4.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can solve for $x$ and $y$ by using the elimination method:
$$\begin{aligned} &2(3x-2y)=6x-4y \\&3(2x-3y)=6x-9y \\&\Rightarrow 6x-4y-6x+9y=5y=15 \Rightarrow y=3 \\&\Rightarrow 2x-3y=-14 \Rightarrow 2x-9=-14 \Rightarrow x=-\frac{5}{2} \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, $x-y=-\frac{5}{2}-3=-\frac{11}{2}=-5.5$, which is closest to choice D, 8.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D") 

One way to solve the system of equations is by multiplying the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$ to get: 

$$\begin{aligned}& 4x-6y=-28 \\& 9x-6y=-18\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: 

$$\begin{aligned} -5x&=-10 \\ x&=2 \end{aligned}$$

Substituting this value of $x$ into either equation, we can solve for $y$:

$$\begin{aligned} 3x-2y&=-6 \\ 3(2)-2y&=-6 \\ -2y&=-12 \\ y&=6 \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")  

The system of equations can be rewritten as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}& 4 x-6 y=-28 \quad\quad (1) \\& 6 x-4 y=-12 \quad\quad (2)\end{aligned}$$

Multiplying equation $(1)$ by $-2$ and adding it to equation $(2)$, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}(-2)\times (1)+ (2) &: 2x+2y=4 \\ &\implies x+y=2\quad\quad (3)\end{aligned}$$

Adding equations $(1)$ and $(2)$, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}(1)+(2)&: 10x-10y=-40 \\& \implies x-y=-4\quad\quad (4)\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, $(x-y)=\boxed{-8}$
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To solve the system of linear equations: 

$$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$

We can multiply the first equation by $-2$, and the second equation by $-3$, getting:

$$\begin{aligned}& -4x + 6y = 28 \\& -9x + 6y = 18\end{aligned}$$

Now, we can add up the two equations, eliminating variable y:

$$\begin{aligned}&-4x+6y+(-9x+6y)=28+18\\&-13x+12y=46\end{aligned}$$

Then, we can multiply the second equation by $\frac{1}{2}$, getting:

$$\begin{aligned}&-\frac{13}{2}x+6y=23\\&-13x+12y=46\end{aligned}$$

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second one, eliminating variable y:

$$\begin{aligned}&(-13x+12y) - (-\frac{13}{2}x+6y) = 46-23\\&-\frac{13}{2}x+6y=23\\&x-y=\frac{23}{(-\frac{13}{2})}-1\\&x-y=-\frac{23}{13}-1\\&x-y=-\frac{36}{13}\end{aligned}$$


Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("None of the Above") -> Answer("$-\frac{36}{13}$")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")  
The solution to the system of equations is $x=-12$ and $y=2$. Therefore, $x-y=-12-2=-14$, which is the same as option B.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")  

We can use elimination to solve the system of equations. Multiply the first equation by $-2$ and the second equation by $3$, then add them together: 

$$\begin{aligned} &-2(2x-3y=-14)+3(3x-2y=-6)\\
\Rightarrow \quad & -4x + 6y = 28 + 9x - 6y = -18\\
\Rightarrow  \quad &5x = 10\\
\Rightarrow  \quad &x = 2\end{aligned}$$

Substitute $x=2$ into either equation to solve for $y$: 

$$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14\\
\Rightarrow \quad & 4 -3 y=-14\\
\Rightarrow \quad & y = 6\end{aligned}$$

Thus, $x-y=2-6=-4$, so the correct answer is (B).

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$
Response 0:
To find the equation of the line, we can use the point-slope form. Since it passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$, the equation is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$. To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the $x$- and $y$-values of each point into the equation and see which ones make it true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
We can start by using the point-slope formula for the equation of a line: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line.

Since the line passes through the origin $(0,0)$ and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$, we have:

$y - 0 = \frac{1}{7}(x - 0)$

Simplifying, we get:

$y = \frac{1}{7}x$

Now we can test each point to see which one satisfies this equation.

Action: Answer("A") 

The point $(0,7)$ does not satisfy the equation, since plugging in $x=0$ gives $y=0$ rather than $y=7$.

Action: Answer("B")

The point $(1,7)$ does not satisfy the equation, since plugging in $x=1$ gives $y=\frac{1}{7}$ rather than $y=7$.

Action: Answer("C")

The point $(7,7)$ does satisfy the equation, since plugging in $x=7$ gives $y=1$.

Action: Answer("D")

The point $(14,2)$ does not satisfy the equation, since plugging in $x=14$ gives $y=2$ rather than $y=2$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } (7,7)}$.
Response 4:
We can solve this problem by using the point-slope form of the equation of a line: $y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)$, where $(x_0, y_0)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope of the line.

Since the line passes through the origin, we have $x_0 = 0$ and $y_0 = 0$. Substituting $m = \frac{1}{7}$, $x_0 = 0$, and $y_0 = 0$ into the point-slope form, we get $y - 0 = \frac{1}{7}(x - 0)$. Simplifying this equation gives us $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.

Now we can check which of the given points satisfies this equation:
  - For point A: $(0,7)$, we have $y = \frac{1}{7}(0) = 0$, which is not equal to 7. So point A does not lie on the line.
  - For point B: $(1,7)$, we have $y = \frac{1}{7}(1) = \frac{1}{7}$, which is not equal to 7. So point B does not lie on the line.
  - For point C: $(7,7)$, we have $y = \frac{1}{7}(7) = 1$, which is equal to 7. So point C lies on the line.
  - For point D: $(14,2)$, we have $y = \frac{1}{7}(14) = 2$, which is not equal to 7. So point D does not lie on the line.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
To solve this problem, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation, which is:
$$y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$$
where $m$ is the slope of the line, and $(x_1,y_1)$ is any point on the line. Since the line passes through the origin, we have $(x_1,y_1)=(0,0)$. Substituting $m=\frac{1}{7}$ and $(x_1,y_1)=(0,0)$ into the equation above, we get:
$$y-0=\frac{1}{7}(x-0)$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$y=\frac{1}{7}x$$
Therefore, the point that lies on the line is given by $(x,y)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ (7,7)}$.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 0:
Let's suppose $x$ is the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture will be $1-x$. We can set up an equation based on the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture:
\begin{align*}
240x + 210\cdot\frac{3}{4}(1-x) &= 270 \\
240x + 157.5 - 157.5x &= 270 \\
82.5x &= 112.5 \\
x &= \frac{112.5}{82.5} \\
x &= \frac{4}{3}
\end{align*}
Therefore, Jennifer must mix $\frac{4}{3}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{1}{3}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal to get a mixture of one cup with 270 calories. To find out how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture, we just need to divide $\frac{4}{3}$ by 3:
\begin{align*}
\frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} &= \frac{4}{9}
\end{align*}
So the answer is $\frac{4}{9}$, which is approximately $\frac{0.44}{1}$. The closest choice to this answer is B, $\frac{1}{4}$ cup. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's assume Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal and $(1-x)$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. Then, the total number of calories in one cup is:
\begin{align*}
240x + 210(1-x) &= 270\\
30x &= 60\\
x &= 2/3
\end{align*}
So, Jennifer mixes $2/3$ cup of Super Grain cereal and $1/3$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal.
Therefore, Answer("C") is correct.
Response 2:
Let's assume that Jennifer chooses $x$ cups of the Super Grain cereal.
The total number of calories in the mixture is 240x + 210. We want this to equal 270 since that is the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to solve for $x$:
$$240x+210=270$$
Subtracting 210 from both sides, we get:
$$240x=60$$
Dividing both sides by 240, we get:
$$x=\frac{1}{4}$$
So Jennifer will need $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of the Super Grain cereal to make a mixture that has a total of 270 calories per cup.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Let's assume that Jennifer will mix $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4} - x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. We can set up the equation:
\begin{align*}
240x + 210\left(\frac{3}{4} - x\right) &= 270 \\
240x + 157.5 - 210x &= 270 \\
30x &= 112.5 \\
x &= 3.75
\end{align*}
So Jennifer will mix $3.75$ cups of Super Grain cereal, which is $\frac{3.75}{4} = 0.9375$ or approximately $\frac{15}{16}$ cup of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let $a$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in cups. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal is $1-a$ cups. We can write an equation based on the total amount of calories in the mixture:
\begin{align*}
240a+210\left(1-a\right)&=270\\
240a+210-210a&=270\\
30a&=60\\
a&=2/3
\end{align*}
Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{2}{3}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{1}{3}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

Since the serving size of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and Jennifer uses $\frac{1}{3}$ cup, the number of servings of Crunchy Grain cereal in the mixture is:
$$\frac{1/3}{3/4} = \frac{4}{9}$$

Since each serving of Crunchy Grain cereal provides $180$ milligrams of potassium, the mixture provides a total of:
$$(180\text{ mg/serving})\left(\frac{4}{9}\text{ serving}\right) = 80\text{ mg}$$

Since $80\text{ mg}$ is $5\%$ of the daily allowance for adults, the daily allowance for adults is:
$$\frac{80\text{ mg}}{0.05} = 1600\text{ mg}$$

Since one serving of Crunchy Grain cereal provides $180\text{ mg}$ of potassium, a serving of Super Grain cereal must provide:
$$\frac{1600\text{ mg}}{5}=320\text{ mg}$$

Since one cup of the mixture provides $180$ milligrams of potassium from Crunchy Grain cereal, the amount of potassium in one cup of the mixture from Super Grain cereal is:
$$320\text{ mg}-180\text{ mg}=140\text{ mg}$$

Since one cup of Super Grain cereal provides $240$ calories, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is:
$$\frac{140\text{ mg}}{180\text{ mg}}\cdot\frac{210\text{ calories}}{240\text{ calories/cup}}=\frac{7}{8}\text{ cup}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 5:
Let's assume that $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal is mixed with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The number of calories from the Super Grain cereal is $240x$. The number of calories from the Crunchy Grain cereal is $\left(\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}\right)\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right) - 50\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$.

We can set up the equation:
$240x + \left(\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}\right)\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right) - 50\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right) = 270$

Simplifying and solving for $x$, we have
$240x + 130 - 35 + 50x = 360$

Simplifying further,
$290x + 95 = 360$
$290x = 265$
$x = \frac{265}{290} \approx 0.91$

Therefore, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)} \frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 6:
Let $x$ be the number of cups of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. Since the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, we can write the following equation to represent the total calories in one cup of the mixture: $$210\left(\frac{3}{4}\operatorname{cup}\right) + 240x\operatorname{cup} = 270\operatorname{cal}.$$Simplifying the equation gives $x = \frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 7:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal in the mixture.
From the information given, we know that the Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup. Therefore, it provides: $$\frac{210 \text{ calories}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup}} = 280 \text{ calories per cup}$$
Thus, the mixture provides $280+240 = 520$ calories per cup.
Since the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, we can create an equation to find $x$: $$270 = 280(1-x) + 240x$$
Solving for $x$, we get: $$ x = \frac{1}{4} $$
Therefore, Jennifer uses $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal in the mixture.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4} - x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

Total calories in the mixture = (calories from Super Grain cereal) + (calories from Crunchy Grain cereal) 

We know that Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. Therefore, the calories from the Super Grain cereal in the mixture is 240x.

We also know that Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup. Therefore, the calories from the Crunchy Grain cereal in the mixture is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}} \cdot (\frac{3}{4}-x) = 280(1-x)$. 

We are given that the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$240x + 280(1-x) = 270$

Simplifying and solving for $x$, we get:

$x = \frac{1}{4}$

Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal.

Answer: Choice $\textbf{(B)}$ $\frac{1}{4}$ cup.
Response 9:
Let $x$ be the number of cups of Super Grain cereal used. The total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is equal to the sum of calories from $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal and $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. To find $x$, we can solve the following equation for $x$:
\begin{align*}
\text{total calories in one cup of mixture} &= \text{calories from Crunchy Grain cereal} + \text{calories from Super Grain cereal} \\
270 &= \left( \frac{3}{4} \text{ cup} \right) (210 \text{ calories/cup}) + x (240 \text{ calories/cup}) \\
270 &= 157.5 + 240x \\
112.5 &= 240x \\
x &= \frac{112.5}{240} = \frac{15}{32}
\end{align*}
So Jennifer uses $\frac{15}{32}$ cups of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture, which is about $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{1}{3} \text{ cup}}$.

Response 2:
To find an equation that is perpendicular to $-2x+3y=6$, we need to find a line with a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. 

Action: Answer("B") 

To see this, we calculate the slope of the given line: 

$$-2x+3y=6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3y=2x+6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$$

So the slope of the given line is $\frac23$. The negative reciprocal of $\frac23$ is $-\frac32$. 

The equation $3x+4y=6$ can be written in slope-intercept form as $y=-\frac{3}{4}x+\frac32$. The slope of this line is $-\frac34$, which is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. Therefore, the graph of $3x+4y=6$ is perpendicular to the graph of $-2x+3y=6$.
Response 3:
To determine the equation that is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find its slope.  Rearranging the given equation, we get:

$$3y = 2x + 6$$
$$y = \frac{2}{3}x + 2$$

The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$.

For a line to be perpendicular to this line, it must have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$.

Among the given options, the only equation with slope $-\frac{3}{2}$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 3x + 2y = 6}$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
First, we need to find the slope of the given equation by putting it in slope-intercept form, which is $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. For two lines to be perpendicular, their slopes must be negative reciprocals of each other. The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$, and we can see that only choice $\textbf{(C)}$ has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$, so: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
To check if two lines are perpendicular, we need to check the product of their slopes. Their product should be -1 for them to be perpendicular. The given equation can be written in slope-intercept form as: $$3y=2x+6\implies y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$$So its slope is $\frac{2}{3}$. The slope of the equation in options A, B, C, and D are $\frac{-3}{2},\frac{-3}{4},\frac{-1}{2}$, and $\frac{-1}{3}$, respectively.

Out of all the given options, only Option D: $2 x+6 y=3$ has a slope that is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. 

Thus, 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
To solve this, we first need to find the slope of the line $-2 x+3 y=6$. We can do this by rearranging the equation into slope-intercept form, $y = \frac{2}{3} x + 2$. So the slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$. The line perpendicular to this line will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$, which is $-\frac{3}{2}$. Let's check which line has this slope. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
To solve the problem, we need to find the slope of the given equation and the slope of each of the equations in the choices. The slope of the equation $-2x + 3y = 6$ is $\frac{2}{3}$. The equation perpendicular to this one must have a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$, which is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$.

The equation $3x+2y=6$ has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$, so it is perpendicular to the given equation.

Response 3:
Action: Answer("A") 

We can use elimination to solve the system of equations.
Multiplying the first equation by 4, we get $4kx-12y=16$.
Multiplying the second equation by $-k$ we get $-4kx+5ky=-7k$.

Adding the two equations gives $(5k-12)y=16-7k$.

For the system to have no solution, the coefficients of $y$ must be different (since $y$ can't have two different values).
So we need $5k-12\neq 0$ which implies $k\neq \frac{12}{5}$.

Therefore, the answer is A: $\frac{12}{5}$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 10,800$
  B: $\$ 16,200$
  C: $\$ 21,600$
  D: $\$ 29,700$
Response 0:
Let $A$ be the initial value of the camera equipment, and let $r$ be the depreciation rate per year. Then we have $A(12r) = A - 32,400$, which simplifies to $r = \frac{1}{16}$. 

So after $4$ years, the equipment is worth $A(1-4r) = A \left(1-\frac{1}{4}\right) = A\cdot\frac{3}{4}$.

Thus, the equipment is worth $\frac{3}{4}\cdot\$ 32,400 = \$ 24,300$. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above") because none of the given choices is the correct answer.
Response 1:
Solution: 

The equipment depreciates at a constant rate for 12 years, so the equipment will lose the same amount of value in each of the 12 years. If we let the value of the equipment 4 years after purchase be $x$, then we have:

$x = 32,400 - 4 \cdot \dfrac{32,400}{12}$

Simplifying:

$x = 32,400 - 10,800$

$x = 21,600$

Therefore, the camera equipment is worth $\$21,600$ 4 years after it is purchased.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
First, we need to find the rate at which the equipment depreciates per year. Since the equipment depreciates at a constant rate, we can use straight-line depreciation to find this rate. 

The initial value of the equipment is $\$ 32,400$. Its value after 12 years is $\$ 0$. Therefore, the equipment depreciates $\$ 32,400$ in 12 years. 

The annual depreciation is:

$ \frac{\$ 32,400}{12 \text{ years}} = \$ 2,700 \text{ per year}$

After 4 years, the equipment has depreciated:

$4 \text{ years} \times \$ 2,700 \text{ per year} = \$ 10,800$

Subtracting this amount from the initial value gives us the value of the equipment after 4 years:

$\$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 = \$ 21,600$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$ 21,600$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Solution:
The value of the camera equipment depreciates linearly over the 12-year period, so the value decreases by $\frac{\$ 32,400}{12} = \$ 2,700$ each year. After 4 years, the equipment would have depreciated by $4 \times \$ 2,700 = \$ 10,800$, so the equipment would be worth $\$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 = \$ 21,600$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let the value of the equipment $t$ years after it is purchased be $V(t)$. We know that it depreciates at a constant rate, so $V(t)$ is a linear function of $t$. We have two data points: $V(0)=32,400$ (initial value) and $V(12)=0$ (value after 12 years). Therefore, we can find the slope of the line:
$$
m=\frac{V(12)-V(0)}{12-0}=-\frac{32,400}{12}=-2,700
$$
So the equation of the line is $V(t)=-2,700t+32,400$. We want to find $V(4)$:
$$
V(4)=-2,700(4)+32,400=\$ 21,600
$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$ 21,600}$.
Response 5:
Solution: 

If the equipment depreciates at a constant rate for 12 years, then the equipment loses $\$ 32,400/12 = \$ 2,700$ of value every year. 

After 4 years, the equipment would have lost $4 \times 2700 = \$ 10,800$ of value. 

Therefore, the equipment would be worth $\$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 = \$ 21,600$ after 4 years. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Since the equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years and it has already been 4 years since it was purchased, we can assume that $\frac{4}{12}=\frac{1}{3}$ of its value has already depreciated.
Therefore, the camera equipment is worth $100\%-\frac{1}{3}\cdot 100\% = 66 \frac{2}{3}\%$ of its original value.
Hence, its value is currently worth $66 \frac{2}{3}\%\cdot \$ 32,400 = \$ 21,600$
Therefore, the answer is \boxed{C: \$ 21,600}.
Response 8:
Let $V$ be its value and $t$ be time in years. The depreciation rate $r$ per year is constant. Thus, we have:

$$V = 32,400 - rt$$

The equipment is considered to have no value after 12 years. Therefore we have:

$$0 = 32,400 - r(12)$$

Solving for $r$, we get $r=2,700$/year. 

After 4 years, the equipment is worth:

$$V=32,400-2,700\times4$$

Thus,

Action: Answer("C")  $\$ 21,600$
Response 9:
To solve this problem, we will use the concept of linear depreciation, which means that the value of the equipment decreases uniformly over time. The value $V$ of the equipment after $t$ years can be modeled by:

$V(t) = V_0 - \frac{V_0}{12}t$

where $V_0$ is the initial value of the equipment (32,400 in this case), and $t$ is the time in years. 

To find the value after 4 years, we can plug in $t=4$ and evaluate:

$V(4) = 32,400 - \frac{32,400}{12}(4) = 21,600$

Therefore, the equipment is worth $\$ 21,600$ after 4 years.

Question: $$\frac{a-b}{a}=c$$In the equation above, if $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: $c>1$
  B: $c=1$
  C: $c=-1$
  D: $c<-1$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To answer this question, we can simplify the expression as follows:
$$\frac{a-b}{a}=c \iff 1-\frac{b}{a}=c \iff \frac{-b}{a}=c-1$$
Since $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, $\frac{-b}{a}$ is positive.
Therefore, $c-1$ is also positive, so $c$ must be greater than $1$.
Thus, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:

Response 5:
To solve, we can simplify the given expression as follows,

$$\begin{aligned} \frac{a-b}{a} &= \frac{a}{a} - \frac{b}{a} \\ &= 1 - \frac{b}{a} \end{aligned}$$

Since $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, we have $-b <0$.

Therefore, $1 - \frac{b}{a} <1$.

This means that $c$ must be less than 1.

So, the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above")  (since none of the options state "$c < 1$")
Response 6:
If $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, then $a-b$ is negative. Since $(\text{negative})/(\text{negative}) = (\text{positive})$, and $(\text{negative})/(\text{positive}) = (\text{negative})$, we know that $\frac{a-b}{a}$ is negative. So the answer must be:

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cylindrical can containing pieces of fruit is filled to the top with syrup before being sealed. The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. If $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, which of the following is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can?
Choices:
  A: $7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  B: $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  C: $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  D: $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 0:
The volume of liquid, which is equal to the volume of syrup, in the cylinder is given by $V_{cyl}=\pi r^{2}h$, where $r$ is the radius of  the cylinder. Since the area of the base of the can is $75\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, we have $\pi r^{2}=75$. We also know that $V_{cyl}=110$. Solving these equations gives $r^{2}=25$ and $r=5$. The total volume of the pieces of fruit is equal to the volume of the cylinder minus the volume of the syrup, which is $V_{fruit}=V_{cyl}-V_{syrup}=\pi r^{2}h-V_{syrup}$. Plugging in the known values gives $V_{fruit}=\pi(5\mathrm{~cm})^{2}(10\mathrm{~cm})-110\mathrm{~cm}^{3}=650\pi-110\approx 185.6$. The closest answer choice is $\boxed{\mathrm{(B)~}185\mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
We can start by finding the volume of the cylindrical can. That would simply be the product of the base area and the height. So, 

$$\text{Volume of the can} = (75)(10) = 750 \text{ cm}^3$$

However, we know that only $110 \text{ cm}^3$ of that volume is syrup. The rest of the volume is the fruit. So, 

$$\text{Volume of fruit} = \text{Volume of the can} - \text{Volume of syrup} = 750 - 110 = 640 \text{ cm}^3$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $640 \text{ cm}^3$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding the volume of the can. Since it is a cylinder, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the circular base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. The area of the circular base is given as $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius must be $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Now we can find the volume of the can: $V_{\text{can}} = \pi (4.33)^2 (10) \approx 591.77 \mathrm{~cm}^3$.

Since the can is filled with syrup to the top, and we know the volume of the syrup, we can subtract to find the volume of the fruit: $V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{can}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^3 \approx 481.77 \mathrm{~cm}^3$.

Therefore, the answer is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$, based on the given choices.
Response 3:
Let the volume of the fruit be $v$ cubic cm, then the volume of syrup is equal to the volume of the fruit. Thus we have  \[\pi\cdot\left(\frac{75}{\pi}\right)^2\cdot (10)=v+\pi\cdot\left(\frac{75}{\pi}\right)^2\cdot \frac{110}{\pi}\] Simplifying, we get $v\approx\boxed{\textbf{(C) }640 \text{ cm}^3}.$ 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let the radius of the cylinder be $r \mathrm{~cm}$. Since the area of the base is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^2$, we have $\pi r^2=75$. Multiplying both sides by 10 and using $V=\pi r^2h$ yields the volume of the container (including syrup) to be $750\mathrm{~cm^3}$. Therefore, the volume of the pieces of fruit is $750\mathrm{~cm^3}-110\mathrm{~cm^3}=640\mathrm{~cm^3}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's begin by finding the volume of the can using the given information. 

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula: 

$V = \pi r^2 h$, 

where $r$ is the radius of the base of the cylinder and $h$ is its height. 

We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius can be found by: 

$A = \pi r^2$

$75 = \pi r^2$

$r^2 = \frac{75}{\pi}$

$r = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33$

Therefore, the volume of the can is: 

$V_{can} = \pi \cdot (4.33\mathrm{~cm})^2 \cdot 10\mathrm{~cm} \approx 592 \mathrm{~cm}^3$ 

We are given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, so the volume of the pieces of fruit can be found by subtracting the volume of the syrup from the volume of the can: 

$V_{fruit} = V_{can} - V_{syrup} = 592 \mathrm{~cm}^3 - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^3 = 482 \mathrm{~cm}^3$

Therefore, the answer is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$, which is the only answer that is greater than $482 \mathrm{~cm}^3$.
Response 6:
Let's determine the volume of the cylindrical can first using the formula $V= \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base of the can.
Since the area of the base is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, we can solve for the radius, $r$:
\begin{align*}
\pi r^2 &= 75 \\
r &= \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.87\mathrm{~cm}
\end{align*}

Then, we can find the volume of the can:
\begin{align*}
V_{can} &= \pi r^2 h \\
&= \pi (4.87)^2 (10) \\
&\approx 749.21 \mathrm{~cm}^3
\end{align*}

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top and the volume of the can is $749.21 \mathrm{~cm}^3$, the volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is:
\begin{align*}
V_{fruit} &= V_{can} - 110 \\
&\approx 639.21 \mathrm{~cm}^3
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is closest to $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ 640\text{ }\mathrm{cm}^{3}}$.
Response 7:
Let's begin the question by calculating the volume of the can using the given information.
Volume of the can = Base area x Height
Volume of the can = $75\mathrm{~cm}^{2} \cdot 10\mathrm{~cm}=750\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

The syrup fills the entire volume of the can which is $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, out of which $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ is the syrup.
So, the remaining volume is the volume occupied by the fruit.
Volume occupied by the fruit = Total volume of the can - Volume of the syrup
Volume occupied by the fruit = $750\mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110\mathrm{~cm}^{3}=640\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Hence, the answer is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We can begin by using the formula for the volume of a cylinder to find the volume of the can: 

$V_{\text{can}} = \pi r^2 h$

We are given that the base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is:

$r = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.84 \text{ cm}$

Substituting in the given height $h=10$ cm, we get:

$V_{\text{can}} = \pi (4.84\text{ cm})^2 (10\text{ cm}) \approx 739.7 \text{ cm}^3$

Since we are told that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can, the volume of the pieces of fruit is:

$V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{can}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 629.7 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$ (the closest choice to 629.7)
Response 9:
We can start by finding the volume of the cylinder and then subtracting the volume of the syrup to get the volume of the fruit. 
The volume of the cylinder is given by: 
$V_{cyl} = \text{base area} \times \text{height}=75\text{~cm}^2\times10\text{~cm}=750\text{~cm}^3$

Since $110\text{~cm}^3$ of syrup is needed, the volume of the fruit is:
$V_{fruit} = V_{cyl} - V_{syrup}=750\text{~cm}^3-110\text{~cm}^3=640\text{~cm}^3$

Response 0:
We know that $y=kx$ and $y=24$ when $x=6$. Substituting these values into the equation:  
$$24=k(6)$$
$$k=4$$
Now we need to find $y$ when $x=5$ using the value we found for $k$. Substituting:  
$$y=(4)(5)=20$$
Hence, the answer is:  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
We can determine the constant value $k$ by plugging in the given values, so we have:

$24=k(6)$ 

$k=4$

Now we can use this value to find $y$ when $x=5$: 

$y=4(5) = 20$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
The value of $k$ can be found using the information given. We know that when $x=6$, $y=24$, so:

$$24=k(6)$$
$$k=4$$

Now that we know the value of $k$, we can use it to find the value of $y$ when $x=5$. Substituting $k=4$ and $x=5$:

$$y=kx=4(5)=20$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Solution: 

We can use the given information to solve for $k$. 

$y=kx$ 

$24=k(6)$ 

$k=4$ 

Now we can use the value of $k$ to find $y$ when $x=5$ 

$y=kx$ 

$y=4(5)$ 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
First we can find the value of $k$ as follows:
We know that $y=k x$ and $y=24$ when $x=6$,
Plugging those values: 
$24=k*6$
$k=4$
Now we can find the value of $y$ when $x=5$ as follows:
$y=k*x$
$y=4*5$
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
We can solve this problem by substituting the known values of $x$ and $y$ to find the constant $k$, and then using that value to solve for $y$ when $x=5$. 

Action: $k = \dfrac{y}{x} = \dfrac{24}{6} = 4$

Action: $y = k x = 4 \cdot 5 = 20$

Therefore, the answer is (C) 20.
Response 6:
We know that y = kx, and that y is 24 when x is 6. This means:

24 = k * 6

Solving for k:

k = 24/6

k = 4

Now we can use the value of k to find y when x is 5:

y = k * x

y = 4 * 5

y = 20

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("20")
Response 8:
First, we solve for the constant: 

$y=kx \Rightarrow 24=k\cdot 6 \Rightarrow k=4$

Then we use the value of k to find the answer:

$y=kx \Rightarrow y = 4\cdot 5 \Rightarrow y=20$

Therefore the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
We have $y=kx$ and $y=24$ when $x=6$, so $24=k\cdot 6$. Thus, $k=4$. When $x=5$, we have $y=k\cdot 5=4\cdot 5=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 20}$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If $2 w+4 t=14$ and $4 w+5 t=25$, what is the value of $2 w+3 t ?$
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 10
  C: 13
  D: 17
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve for $w$ and $t$ by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation. This gives us $w = 3$ and $t = 1$. 

Then, $2w+3t = 2(3) + 3(1) = 6 + 3 = \boxed{9}$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve the system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation, which eliminates $w$ and gives us $t$. Then, we substitute $t$ back into one of the original equations to solve for $w$. We get $w = 3$ and $t = 2$, so $2w + 3t = 2(3) + 3(2) = 6 + 6 = 12$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }13}$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve the given equations by multiplying the first equation with 2 and subtracting it from the second equation. We get, $$\begin{aligned} 4w+5t&=25 \\ 4w+8t&=28 \\ \hline \\ 0w+3t&=3 \\ \Rightarrow t &=1 \end{aligned}$$

Substituting $t=1$ in the first equation, we get $2w+4=14,$ which gives $w=5.$ Therefore, $2w+3t=10+3=\boxed{13}.$
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")  

To solve this system of linear equations, first multiply the first equation by 2:
$$\begin{aligned} 2w + 4t &= 14 \\ 4w + 8t &= 28 \end{aligned}$$
Subtract the second equation from this to eliminate $w:$
$$\begin{aligned}4w + 5t &= 25 \\ - (4w + 8t &= 28) \\ \hline -3t &= -3\end{aligned}$$
Therefore, $t = 1.$ Substituting this back into the first equation yields $2w + 4 = 14,$ so $2w = 10,$ or $w = 5.$ 

Finally, 
$$2w + 3t = 2(5)+3(1) = 13.$$ 
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C") 

Here's how you can solve it:
$2 w+4 t=14$ can be simplified as $w+2t=7$
$4 w+5 t=25$ can be simplified as $w+\frac{5}{4}t=\frac{25}{4}$
Now, you can solve for $w$ and $t$ by subtracting the two equations:
$\frac{3}{4}t=\frac{3}{4} \implies t=1$
Substitute the value of $t$ in $w+2t=7$ and solve for $w$:
$w+2(1)=7 \implies w=5$
Finally, substitute $w=5$ and $t=1$ in $2w+3t$ to get:
$2(5)+3(1)=13$
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")  

First, let's solve for $w$ and $t$. One way to do this is to multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by $-1$, and then add the resulting equations:

$4w + 8t = 28$

$-4w -5t = -25$

Adding these two equations gives:

$3t = 3$

So $t=1$. Substituting this value of $t$ into the first equation gives:

$2w + 4(1) = 14$

Solving for $w$ gives $w=5$. 

Finally, we can substitute $w=5$ and $t=1$ into the expression $2w + 3t$ to get:

$2(5) + 3(1) = 10 + 3 = 13$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 13}$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this system of equations by elimination.

Multiplying the first equation by $(-2)$ and adding it to the second equation, we get $(-2)(2w+4t)+4w+5t=-28+25$ which simplifies to $t=-1$. 

Then substituting $t=-1$ in the first equation we have $2w+4(-1)=14$ which simplifies to $w=5$. 

Finally we can compute $2w+3t=2(5)+3(-1)=10-3=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 13}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve the system of equations using either substitution or elimination. Using the elimination method, if we multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation, we get $w+t=11$. Then, we can substitute this value of $w$ in the first equation to get $t=1$ and $w=10$. Thus, $2w+3t=2(10)+3(1)=\boxed{23}$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")  
Solution: 
We can solve the system of equations by elimination or substitution. Here is the solution by elimination:
Multiplying the first equation by $-2$ so we can eliminate $2w$:
$$
\begin{array}{l}{-4 w-8 t=-28} \\ {4 w+5 t=25}\end{array}
$$
Adding the two equations:
$$
\begin{array}{l}{-3 t=-3} \\ {t=1}\end{array}
$$
Now we can solve for $w$ using either equation:
$$
\begin{aligned} 2 w+4(1) &=14 \\ 2w &= 10 \\ w &=5 \end{aligned}
$$
Finally, we can compute $2w + 3t$:
$$
2w + 3t = 2(5) + 3(1) = 10+3 = 13
$$
So the answer is (C) 13.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve the given system of linear equations in two variables by using the elimination method. Multiplying first equation by 5 gives $10 w+20t = 70$. Multiplying second equation by $-4$ gives $-16w-20t=-100$. Adding these two equations eliminates $t$ and we get $-6w=-30$. Thus, $w=5$. Substituting $w=5$ in the first equation gives $10+4t=14$ which implies $t=1$. Therefore, $2w+3t=2\times 5 + 3\times 1 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)} 13}$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$The equation above is true for all $x$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. What is the value of $a b$ ?
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 24
  D: 40
Response 0:
We can start by expanding the left side of the equation:
$$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=5ax^{3}-abx^{2}+20x^{2}+12x-15bx-12=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$

By comparing the coefficients of both sides of the equation, we get a system of three equations:
$$
\begin{aligned} 5 a &=20 \\ -a b+20 &= -9 \\ 3 b &=2 \end{aligned}
$$

Solving for $a$ and $b$ we get: 

$$
a=4 \text{ and } b=\frac{2}{3}
$$

Therefore, $ab=\frac{8}{3}=2\frac{2}{3}$

Action: Answer("None of the above") 

Note: None of the available choices matches the answer.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B") 

The best approach to solve the problem is to compare the coefficients of the terms on both sides of the equation.

The left-hand side of the equation is a product of two binomials. We can distribute the first binomial and get:

$$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right) = 5 a x^{3} + (12 - 5ab) x^{2} + (12 - 4b) x + 12 $$

Now we can compare the coefficients of this polynomial with the coefficients of $20x^{3}-9x^{2}-2x+12$, which is the right-hand side of the equation.

We know that the coefficients of the corresponding terms on both sides of the equation must be equal. So we can set up a system of equations:

$$\begin{aligned}&5a = 20 \\&12-5ab=-9 \\ &12-4b=-2 \\ &12=12\end{aligned}$$

The first equation implies that $a=4$. Substituting into the second equation gives $b = 8/5$.

Therefore, $ab = 4*8/5 = 32/5$, which is approximately equal to 6.4. The closest answer is (B) 20.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can start by expanding the left-hand side: 

$$5ax^3- ab x^2+20ax^2-4bx^2+12ax-12bx+15x^2-3bx+12 = 20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$

Simplifying the right-hand side, we have: 

$$20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12 = 20 x^{3}-20 x^{2}+11x^{2} - 12 x+12x -12 = 20x^{2}(x-1) +11(x-1) - 12(x-1)$$

$$=20x^{2}(x-1)-x+1$$

So our equation now is: 

$$5ax^3- ab x^2+20ax^2-4bx^2+12ax-12bx+15x^2-3bx+12 = 20x^{2}(x-1)-x+1$$

Note that we can collect terms with the same power of $x$ on both sides: 

$$\begin{aligned} 5ax^3 + (-ab+20a)x^2 + (12a-4b+15)x + (-3b+1) &= 20x^{2}(x-1)-x+1\\ 5ax^3 + (-ab+20a)x^2 + (12a-4b+15)x + (-3b+1) &= 20x^{3}-20x^{2}+11x^{2} - 12 x+12x -12\\ 5ax^3 + (-ab+20a-20)x^2 + (12a-4b+15-11)x + (-3b+1+12)&=20x^{3}-20x^{2}-x \end{aligned} $$

Now, since the equation holds true for all $x$, both sides must have the same coefficients for each power of $x$. In particular, the coefficients of $x^3$ must be equal. This tells us that $5a = 20$, or $a=4$. Similarly, the coefficients of $x^2$ must be equal, which gives $-ab+20a-20 = -20$, or $ab = 24$. 

Therefore, the answer is $(C) 24$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C") 

Solution: 
First, we can get the constant term of the left-hand side by substituting $x=0$. This gives:  $$(3) (4) = 12.$$Then, we must get rid of the constant term on the left-hand side. The only way to do this is if we multiply $(ax+3)$ by $4$, since $4\cdot 3 = 12$. This gives:
\begin{align*}
&(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right) \\
=&\left[4 + (ax-1)\right]\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)\\
=&20 x^{3} + (5a-4-b)x^{2}+(16-4b)x-4.
\end{align*}

Comparing the right-hand sides of this equation and the given one, we have:
$5a-4-b = -9$, or $b = 5a+13$, and
$16-4b = -2$, or $b = 9$. Combining these, we get $a=-4$ and $b=9$. Therefore, $ab= (-4)\cdot 9 = \boxed{ - 36}$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A") 

We can begin by multiplying out the left-hand side of the equation to obtain:
$$5ax^{3}-abx^{2}+20x^{2}+12ax-3bx-12=20x^{3}-9x^{2}-2x+12.$$
Comparing the coefficients of each power of $x$ on both sides, we have the following system of equations:
$$\begin{aligned} 5a&=20\\ -ab+20&=-9\\ 12a-3b&=-2\\ -12&=12 \end{aligned}$$Solving for $a$ and $b$, we get $a=4$ and $b=-\frac{29}{3}$. So, $ab=4\left(-\frac{29}{3}\right)=-\frac{116}{3}$. However, this is not one of the answer choices. Multiplying both sides of our original equation by $\frac{3}{4}$ does not change the equation for all $x$, so $a$ and $b$ can be any multiple of $\frac{4}{3}$ and $-\frac{29}{3}$, respectively. Thus, $ab=\frac{116}{9}$. This is closest to answer choice $\textbf{(A)}$.

Question: If $a^{2}+b^{2}=z$ and $a b=y$, which of the following is equivalent to $4 z+8 y$ ?
Choices:
  A: $(a+2 b)^{2}$
  B: $(2 a+2 b)^{2}$
  C: $(4 a+4 b)^{2}$
  D: $(4 a+8 b)^{2}$
Response 0:
We know that $a^2+b^2=z$, therefore, $4a^2+4b^2=4z$.
Adding $4ab$ and $4ab$ on both sides of the equation $4a^2+4b^2=4z$, we get $4a^2+8ab+4b^2=4z+8y$.
Now we can factorize it as $(2a+2b)^2$, which gives us $4z+8y= (2a+2b)^2$.
Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
We will start by simplifying the expression $4z+8y=4(a^{2}+b^{2})+8(a b)$. Then, using the distributive property, we get $4(a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}) = 4(a+b)^{2}$. So the correct answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
First, we can simplify $4z+8y$ by factoring out 4: $4z+8y = 4(z+2y)$. 

We then notice that $z+2y = (a^2+b^2)+2(ab) = (a+b)^2$. 

Substituting this back into $4(z+2y)$, we get $4(a+b)^2$. 

Finally, we can expand the square to get $(2a+2b)^2$. 

Therefore, Action: Answer("B") $(2a+2b)^2$ is equivalent to $4z+8y$.
Response 3:
We can simplify $4z + 8y$ by substituting $z=a^2+b^2$ and $y=ab$: 
\begin{align*}
4z+8y &= 4(a^2+b^2)+8ab\\
&=4a^2+8ab+4b^2\\
&=4(a^2+2ab+b^2)\\
&=4(a+b)^2 \\
\end{align*}
Thus, the equivalent expression is the square of $2(a+b)$, which is $(2a+2b)^2$. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
We can simplify the expression $4z+8y$ as $4(a^2+b^2)+8(ab)$. Grouping like terms, we get $4a^2 + 8ab + 4b^2$, which can be factored as $4(a+b)^{2}$. 

Therefore, 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
We'll perform some algebraic manipulations to simplify the given expression:
\begin{aligned} 4 z+8 y &=4\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right)+8\left(ab\right) \\ &=4 a^{2}+4 b^{2}+8 a b+4 b^{2} \\ &=4\left(a^{2}+4 a b+4 b^{2}\right)\\ &= 4(a+2b)^2\\ \end{aligned}
Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
We can simplify $4z + 8y = 4(a^2 + b^2) + 8(ab)$ as follows:

$4z+8y=4a^{2}+4b^{2}+4ab+4ab=(2a)^{2}+4ab+(2b)^{2}=(2a+2b)^{2}$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
We can simplify the given expression using the identities $2ab = 2ab$ and $a^2 + b^2 = z$:
\begin{align*}
4z + 8y &= 4(a^2 + b^2) + 8(2ab) \\
&= 4a^2 + 4b^2 + 16ab \\
&= 4(a^2 + 4ab + 4b^2) \\
&= 4(a+2b)^2.

There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$
  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$
  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$
  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$
Response 0:
The problem states that there is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Therefore, we can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation $y = mx +b$ where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the independent variable, $m$ is the slope, and $b$ is the y-intercept. The slope of the line passing through the two points $(5, 16.94)$ and $(10, 21.89)$ can be found using the formula: $$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{21.89 - 16.94}{10 - 5} = 0.99.$$The y-intercept $b$ corresponds to the shipping charge when the weight of the merchandise is zero, which is not given in the table. Therefore, we can find $b$ by substituting the slope and the coordinates of one of the points: $$y = mx + b \Rightarrow 16.94 = 0.99(5) + b \Rightarrow b = 11.99.$$Thus, the function that represents the shipping charge $f(x)$ as a function of the weight $x$ is $f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99$.

Response 8:
The function is of the form $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Since there is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise, we can conclude that the slope of the function is constant. The slope of the line passing through the points $(5,16.94)$ and $(10,21.89)$ can be computed as $\frac{21.89-16.94}{10-5}=0.99$. Therefore, $m=0.99$. 

The $y$-intercept can be read off as $(0,b)=(0,0+11.99)$ from the table. Therefore, $b=11.99$. 

Thus, the function that determines the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is $f(x)=0.99x+11.99$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $a$ & $3 a$ & $5 a$ \\\hline$y$ & 0 & $-a$ & $-2 a$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$ are shown in the table above, where $a$ is a constant. If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $x+2 y=a$
  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
Response 0:
To check if $x$ and $y$ have a linear relationship, we need to check if the difference $\Delta y$ and $\Delta x$ are constant. We find that: $$\Delta x = 2a -a = a$$and$$\Delta y= -a - 0 = -a$$We have that $$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-a}{a}=-1$$Therefore, we can see that the constant of proportionality $k=-1$. Thus we can obtain the relationship $y = kx + b$. Substituting $(-a,0)$, we find that $b= a$. Therefore the equation is \begin{align*}
    y&=-x + a \\
    \Rightarrow y &= -x +a \\
    \Rightarrow x + y &= a \\
\end{align*}Thus the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } x+2y=a}$.
Response 1:
To form a linear relationship we want to have a common difference for every rise of 1 in x. From the table, we notice that the difference is the same and is equal to $-a$ for every rise of 1 in x. Rearranging this we get $y=-ax$. Solving for $x$ we get $x=\frac{y}{-a}$ .Simplifying this we get $-ax=y$. Multiplying both sides by $-2$ and then adding $x$ we have $2x-y=0-2(-a)x=2ax$ and hence $2x-y=2ax$. Dividing both sides by $a$ we have $2(\frac{x}{a})-\frac{y}{a}=2x$, which is of the form $x+2 y=k$; the only choice of k is when k $= 0$  so  Answer("None of the above") would be our answer.
Response 2:
We can write the relationship as $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. We can find $m$ by computing the ratios of changes in both $x$ and $y$: $\frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. Picking two pairs of points, say $(x_1,y_1)=(a,0)$ and $(x_2,y_2)=(5a,-2a)$, we get $\frac{-2a-0}{5a-a}=-\frac{2}{3}$, which is the slope $m$. We can find the $y$-intercept $b$ by substituting a pair of points and the slope into the slope-intercept form equation: $y=mx+b$. Picking $(x_1,y_1)=(a,0)$, we get $0=-\frac{2}{3}a+b$, which gives us $b=\frac{2}{3}a$. Therefore, the equation for the linear relationship is $y=-\frac{2}{3} x +\frac{2}{3}a$. Solving for $x$ yields $x+2y=5a$. Hence, the answer is \[\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ x+2 y=5 a}.\]
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
To determine the equation representing the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we can use the formula $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. 

We can find the slope from the table by choosing any two points and using the formula $m=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$. For example, using the points $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$, we get $m=\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-\frac{1}{2}$. 

Next, we can find the $y$-intercept by plugging in any point and the slope into the formula $y=mx+b$ and solving for $b$. Using the point $(a,0)$ and the slope $-\frac{1}{2}$, we get $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b \Rightarrow b=\frac{1}{2}a$. 

Therefore, the equation representing the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}a$. 

To get this equation into the form of the answer choices, we can manipulate it algebraically:

$y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}a  \Rightarrow  \frac{1}{2}x + 2y = a  \Rightarrow  x + 4y = 2a$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("$\mathbf{A}$")
Response 5:
We can solve this using the slope formula for a linear equation $y= mx + b$. 

The slopes of the lines through the points $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$, and through $(3a,-a)$ and $(5a,-2a)$ are $\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{-2a-(-a)}{5a-3a}=-\frac{a}{2a}=-1$ respectively. Since they are linearly related, we can find the equation of their line that passes through $(3a,-a)$ by using point-slope form: 

$y-(-a) = -1(x-3a)$, which simplifies to $y=-x+2a$. 

Subsequently, we can find the equation for the line that passes through $(a,0)$ by using point-slope form once again: 

$0-(-a) = -\frac{1}{2}(a-3a)+(-a)$, which simplifies to $y = -\frac{1}{2}x+a$. 

Hence, we have shown that the table represents the linear equation 

$\begin{cases}y=-\frac{1}{2}x+a \\ y=-x+2a \end{cases}$, 

which simplifies to 

$\begin{cases}x+2y=2a \\ 2x-y=5a\end{cases}$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }x+2 y=5a}$.
Response 6:
To check if there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we can look for a constant slope between any pair of values for $x$ and $y$. Using the points $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$, we find the slope to be: $$\frac{-a-0}{3a-a} = -\frac{a}{2a} = -\frac{1}{2}$$ To confirm this is the same slope between the points $(3a,-a)$ and $(5a,-2a)$, we have: $$\frac{-2a+a}{5a-3a}  = -\frac{a}{2a} = -\frac{1}{2}$$ So we can see that there is indeed a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, with a slope of $-\frac{1}{2}$. To find the corresponding $y$-intercept $b$ in $y=mx+b$, we can use the point $(a,0)$ and solve for $b$: $$0=-\frac{1}{2}(a) + b$$ $$b= \frac{1}{2}(a)$$ So the equation of the linear relationship is $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}(a)$, which can be rearranged to: $x+2y= a$.  

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(A)}$ $x+2y=a$.
Response 7:
We can look at the first two rows of the table: $x=3a$ corresponds to $y=-a$, and $x=5a$ corresponds to $y=-2a$. We see that $x$ increased by $2a$ as $y$ decreased by $a$, so the slope of the linear relationship must be $\frac{-a}{2a}=-\frac12$. The $y$-intercept must be 0 since $y$ is equal to 0 when $x=a$. Thus, the equation must be of the form $y=-\frac12x$. Solving for $a$, we get $-\frac12(3a)=-a$, so $a=2$. Substituting $a=2$ into the equation $y=-\frac12x$ gives $y=-x/2$, which matches choice $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2x-y=-5a}$.
Response 8:
If the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is linear, then we can try to find a linear function that links both variables. From the table, we can see that, for each row, the ratio $x:y$ is a constant. Indeed, we have: \begin{align*}
\frac{x}{y}&=\frac{a}{0}=undefined &&\text{First row} \\
\frac{x}{y}&=\frac{3a}{-a}=-3 &&\text{Second row} \\
\frac{x}{y}&=\frac{5a}{-2a}=-\frac{5}{2} &&\text{Third row}
\end{align*}Thus, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is of the form $x:k y$ for some constant $k\neq0$. We find the value of $k$ by choosing any two rows (other than the first one). For example, we can use the second and third rows: $$\frac{x}{y}=\frac{3a}{-a}\qquad\text{and}\qquad\frac{x}{y}=\frac{5a}{-2a}$$ Setting both equal, we get $3a(-2y)=(-a)(5y)$, which simplifies to $y=-\frac{3}{2}a$. Then, using the value of $y$ in the second row, we have $x=3a(-\frac{3}{2}a)=-\frac{9}{2}a^2$. Therefore, we have found a point on our linear relationship, which is $(x,y)=(-\frac{9}{2}a^2,-\frac{3}{2}a)$. To determine the equation, we just need one more point. Using the first row, we have $0=k(0)$, which implies that $k$ can take any value. Let's use $k=1$, then we get $(x,y)=(a,0)$. The equation of the line passing through these two points is given by: $$\frac{y-0}{x-a}=\frac{-\frac{3}{2}a-0}{-\frac{9}{2}a^2-a}$$ which simplifies to $2x-y=7a$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
Response 0:
We know that $1 \text{ decagram}=10 \text{ grams}=10,000\text{ milligrams}$. Therefore, we can write $$2\text{ decagrams}=2\times10,000=20,000\text{ milligrams}.$$Since there are $1,000$ milligrams in 1 gram, we have $$20,000\text{ milligrams}=\frac{20,000}{1,000}=20 \text{ grams}.$$Finally, since there are $1$ milligram in $1/1,000,000$ grams, there are $$20\text{ grams}=20\times 1,000\times 1,000=20,000,000$$ milligrams in 2-decagrams. Since we are interested in the number of 1-milligram doses, there are $20,000,000$ doses in one 2-decagram container.
$$\text{Answer: } \textbf{(D) }20,000,000$$
Response 1:
The given information can be summarized as: 1 decagram = 10 grams = 10,000 milligrams. 

So, 2 decagrams = 20,000 mg. 

Since there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container, there will be 20,000 one-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
To answer this question, we need to convert from decagrams to milligrams. To do this, we will use the conversion factor below: 

$$1 \text{ decagram} = 10,000 \text{ milligrams}$$

So, we can start by finding the number of milligrams in one 2-decagram container as follows:

$$2 \text{ decagrams} \times 10,000 \frac{\text{milligrams}}{\text{decagram}} = 20,000 \text{ milligrams}$$

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in one gram, we can find the number of 1-milligram doses by dividing the total number of milligrams by 1,000:

$$20,000 \text{ milligrams} \div 1,000\frac{\text{doses}}{\text{gram}} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }2,000} \text{ doses}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }2,000}$.
Response 3:
One decagram is equal to ten grams. Therefore, two decagrams is equal to twenty grams. One gram is equal to 1,000 milligrams. So, 20 grams equals 20,000 milligrams. 

Dividing 20,000 milligrams by 1 milligram per dose gives: 

$$20,000/1=20,000$$

There are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
$1$ decagram = $10$ grams = $10,000$ milligrams.

So, $2$ decagram = $2\times10,000=20,000$ milligrams. 

Thus, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Since $1$ decagram =$10$ grams and $1,000$ milligrams =$1$ gram, we can convert 2-decagram into milligrams as follows: $$2 \text{ decagram}=2 \times10 \times1,000\text{ milligrams}=20,000\text{ milligrams}$$

Therefore, there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container. Since 1-milligram is a very small dose, there are \frac{20,000}{1}=20,000 one-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

So the answer is  {\bf (D) } 20, 000. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
One decagram is equal to 10 grams, so two decagrams are equal to 20 grams. One gram is equal to 1,000 milligrams. Therefore, 20 grams is equal to 20,000 milligrams. This is the amount of medicine in the container. Since there are 20,000 milligrams, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
We can convert 2 decagrams to grams first: $$2 \text{ decagrams }=2\times 10 \text{ grams }=20\text{ grams}.$$Then we can convert grams to milligrams: $$20\text{ grams}=20 \times 1000 \text{ milligrams }=20,000 \text{ milligrams}.$$Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
$1 \text{ decagram }= 10 \text{ grams }= 10,000 \text{ milligrams }$.

So, $2 \text{ decagrams }= 20,000 \text{ mg }$.

Therefore, in one 2-decagram container there are 20,000 1-milligram doses.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
One container has 2 decagrams, which is the same as $2 \times 10 = 20$ grams. Since 1 gram is 1000 milligrams, 20 grams is $20\times 1000 = 20000$ milligrams. Then, since 1mg per dose, the total number of doses in one container is $\frac{20000}{1}=20000$.

$h(x)$ is obtained by subtracting $g(x)$ from 1. To find $h(0)$, we need to find $g(0)$. 
$$g(x)=2x-1 \Rightarrow g(0)=2(0)-1=-1$$
Now we can substitute $g(0)$ in the formula for $h(x)$:

Question: A psychologist set up an experiment to study the tendency of a person to select the first item when presented with a series of items. In the experiment, 300 people were presented with a set of five pictures arranged in random order. Each person was asked to choose the most appealing picture. Of the first 150 participants, 36 chose the first picture in the set. Among the remaining 150 participants, $p$ people chose the first picture in the set. If more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture in the set, which of the following inequalities best describes the possible values of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $p>0.20(300-36)$, where $p \leq 150$
  B: $p>0.20(300+36)$, where $p \leq 150$
  C: $p-36>0.20(300)$, where $p \leq 150$
  D: $p+36>0.20(300)$, where $p \leq 150$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
The total number of people who chose the first picture among the first 150 and the remaining 150 participants is $36+p$. This must be greater than $20 \%$ of the total number of participants which is $0.20(300)=60$. So we have $36+p>60$, which simplifies to $p>24$. Since $p$ must be less than or equal to 150, the inequality becomes $24<p\leq150$. Now we need to look for the answer choice that corresponds to this inequality. We can start by simplifying the inequalities from each option:
- Option A: $p>0.20(300-36) \Rightarrow p>52.8$, BUT this contradicts with the fact that $p\leq 150$. So we can eliminate this option.
- Option B: $p>0.20(300+36) \Rightarrow p>67.2$, BUT this also contradicts with the fact that $p\leq 150$. So we can eliminate this option.
- Option C: $p-36>0.20(300) \Rightarrow p>96$, which satisfies $24<p\leq150$.
- Option D: $p+36>0.20(300) \Rightarrow p>48$, BUT this contradicts with the fact that $p\leq 150$. So we can eliminate this option.

Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Rewriting the problem for ease of understanding, we get that out of $150$ people, $36$ choose the first item.
Now, if more than $20 \%$ of the $300$ people choose the first item, then the total number of people who selects first item is greater than $60.$ This implies that $24+p>60$ or $p>36$ (since $p \le 150$).
Therefore the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } p+36>0.20(300) \text{, where } p\leq150}.$
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
The proportion of the first 150 participants who chose the first picture is $\frac{36}{150} = 0.24$. If more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture, then we know that $p + 36$ (the total number of people who chose the first picture) is greater than $0.20(300)$ (the number we would expect if $20 \%$ of the people chose the first picture). Hence, we can translate the previous sentence into an inequality: $$p+36>0.20(300) \Rightarrow p > 0.20(300) - 36.$$ Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(D)}.$
Response 9:
The total number of people who selected the first picture in the set is $36+p$. The percentage of people who selected the first picture is:
\begin{align*}
\frac{36+p}{300} &= \frac{12+p/3}{100} \\
\Rightarrow 36+p &= 4(12+p/3)=48+\frac{4}{3}p \\
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{3}p &\leq 12 \\
\Rightarrow p &\leq 36.
\end{align*}
Therefore, $p$ cannot be greater than $150-36=114$. Since more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture in the set, $p$ must be greater than $0.20(300)=60$. Combining these inequalities, we get $60<p\leq 114$. Thus, the correct answer is:

Completing the square of the first term leads to $(1.5x-2.4)^{2} = 2.25x^{2}-7.2x+5.76$. Therefore,$$
(1.5 x-2.4)^{2}-\left(5.2 x^{2}-6.4\right) = (2.25x^{2}-7.2x+5.76) - (5.2x^{2}-6.4) = -2.95x^{2}-7.2x+0.64
$$Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\:-2.95x^{2}-7.2x+0.64}$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ passes through the origin. Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 4
  C: 8
  D: 16
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To pass through the origin, the line needs to satisfy the equation $y=mx$.
We can find the slope by using the two given points: $m = \frac{32-k}{k-2}$
Setting $y=mx$ and $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ in the slope formula, we have:
$$k=m(2)$$
$$32=m(k)$$

Multiplying these two equations, we get:
$$64=m^2(2)(k)$$
$$\frac{32}{k-2}=\frac{k}{32-k}$$
$$32(k-2)=k(32-k)$$
$$32k-64=k^2$$
$$k^2-32k+64=0$$
$$(k-16)^2=0$$

Thus $k = 16$ and Answer("D") is correct.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Since the line passes through the origin, we can substitute $(0,0)$ for $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ and solve for $k$. 
Substituting $(2,k)$, we get $k=\frac{k}{2}$ or $k=0$. 
Substituting $(k,32)$, we get $k=\frac{32}{k}$ or $k=4$ or $k=-4$. 
Therefore, the possible value of $k$ is:

Action: Answer("A and B")
Response 4:
Substituting $(2, k)$ and $(k,32)$ into the equation of the line $y=mx+b$, and since the problem states that the line passes through the origin $(0,0)$, we have $(2, k)$ and $(k,32)$ lie on $y=mx$. Substituting, we have the following equations:
\begin{align*}
k&=2m, \\
32&=km. \\
\end{align*}
Solving for $m$, we get $m=\frac{32}{k}.$ Substituting this expression for $m$ into the equation $k=2m$, we have $k=2\cdot \frac{32}{k}$ which simplifies to $k^2=64$, and thus $k=8$. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
We know that the line passes through the origin $(0, 0)$, so we can substitute these values into the equation of the line and find $k$.

The equation of the line can be found using the slope formula:

$$\frac{32-k}{k-2} = \frac{32-0}{k-0}$$

Simplifying this equation:

$$\frac{32-k}{k-2} = \frac{32}{k}$$

$$32k - k^2 = 64 - 2k$$

$$k^2 - 34k + 64 = 0$$

$$(k-2)(k-32) = 0$$

Thus $k$ could be 2 or 32. 

Answer("A") or Answer("D") are both possible.
Response 7:
To determine the value of $k$, we need to find the equation of the line passing through $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$. The slope of the line is given by:

$$m = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}$$

Since the line passes through the origin, the $y$-intercept is 0. Thus, the equation of the line is:

$$y = mx = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2} x$$

Setting $x = 2$ gives:

$$y = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2} \cdot 2 = \frac{64 - 2k}{k - 2}$$

Since the line passes through $(2, k)$, we also have:

$$k = \frac{64 - 2k}{k - 2} \iff k^2 - 2k = 64 - 2k \iff k^2 = 64$$

Therefore, $k$ could be $\pm 8$. However, the point $(8, 32)$ is not on the line determined by $(2, 8)$ and $(8, 32)$. Therefore, $k$ could be $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0}$. Answer(A).
Response 8:
First, we notice that the line passes through the origin, which means that the line intersects the point $(0,0)$. Therefore, we have the equations:

$2k = k \cdot m$ and $32 = 2 \cdot k \cdot m$,

where $m$ represent the slope of the line. Simplifying the first equation, we get $k = 0$ or $m = 2$.

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

$32 = 0$ (if $k = 0$) or $32 = 4 \cdot k$ (if $m = 2$).

Thus the only possible value for $k$ is $8$. Answer: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To find the line passing through two points, we first have to find its slope.
The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula:

$$m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$


If the line passing through the points $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ passes through the origin, then the two points and the origin are collinear and the slope of the line joining any two points is the same as the slope of the line joining the point to the origin. So, the point $(k,32)$ must be on the line joining the origin and the point $(2,k)$. Therefore, the slope of this line is:

$$m=\frac{k}{2}$$

Setting $(2,k)$ into the slope formula and expanding $(k,32)$ results in $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k-2}$. Solving this equation we get the possible value of $k$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If 50 one-cent coins were stacked on top of each other in a column, the column would be approximately $3 \frac{7}{8}$ inches tall. At this rate, which of the following is closest to the number of one-cent coins it would take to make an 8-inch-tall column?
Choices:
  A: 75
  B: 100
  C: 200
  D: 390
Response 0:
To solve this problem, we need to divide the height of the 50 coins by 50 to find the height of one coin. We can then divide the desired column height (8 inches) by the height of one coin to find the number of coins needed.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
To solve this problem, we can use a proportion. We know that 50 coins make a column that is $3 \frac{7}{8}$ inches tall, so we can set up the proportion: 

$\frac{50 ~\text{coins}}{3 \frac{7}{8} ~\text{inches}} = \frac{x ~\text{coins}}{8 ~\text{inches}}$

where $x$ is the number of coins needed for an 8-inch-tall column. To solve for $x$, we can cross-multiply and simplify: 

$50 \cdot 8 = (3 \frac{7}{8})x$

$400 = \frac{31}{8}x$

$x \approx \frac{8}{31} \cdot 400 \approx 103$

So it would take about 103 one-cent coins to make an 8-inch-tall column.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
To solve this problem, we can divide the height of the column (3 7/8 inches) by the number of coins (50) to find the approximate height of each coin: 

$3\frac{7}{8} \div 50 \approx 0.0775$ inches per coin

Next, we can divide the desired height of the column (8 inches) by the approximate height of each coin to find the number of coins:

$8 \text{ inches} \div 0.0775 \text{ inches per coin} \approx 103$ coins

The median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for all 50 states was $26.95 \%$. What is the difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states?
Choices:
  A: $0.05 \%$
  B: $0.95 \%$
  C: $1.22 \%$
  D: $7.45 \%$
Response 0:
We first arrange the seven percentages in ascending order to get $19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, and $36.4 \%$. We find the median of these percentages, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median of the seven states and that of all 50 states is $27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$
Response 1:
First, we need to list the given percentages in order from least to greatest:

State D: 19.5%
State A: 21.9%
State C: 25.9%
State B: 27.9%
State E: 30.1%
State G: 35.5%
State F: 36.4%

Then we find the middle term, which is the median of these 7 states:

State D: 19.5%
State A: 21.9%
State C: 25.9%
Median: State B: 27.9%
State E: 30.1%
State G: 35.5%
State F: 36.4%

The median percentage for these 7 states is $27.9 \%$. The difference between this median and the median for all 50 states ($26.95 \%$) is:

$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $0.95 \%$.
Response 2:
First, we need to find the median of the percentages given in the table. 

Listing them in increasing order: 

$19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%$

The median is $27.9 \%$.

The difference between $26.95 \%$ and $27.9 \%$ is $0.95 \%$. 

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$
Response 3:
The median of the given 7 percentages can be found by ordering them from smallest to largest: 

$$\text{State D: }19.5\%,\quad\text{State A: }21.9\%,\quad\text{State C: }25.9\%,\quad\text{State B: }27.9\%,\quad\text{State E: }30.1\%,\quad \text{State G: }35.5\%,\quad \text{State F: }36.4\%$$

The median is the middle value, which is $27.9\%$.

The difference between the median of the given 7 percentages and the median of all 50 states is:

$$|26.95\%-27.9\%| = 0.95\%$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95\%}$.
Response 4:
We need to find the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states. To find the median, we need to order the data from least to greatest: \begin{align*}
&19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\% \\
\end{align*}The median percent for these 7 states is $27.9 \%$, which is one of the given values from the table of data. The difference between the median percent of $27.9 \%$ and the overall median percent of $26.95 \%$ is $27.9\%-26.95\%=0.95\%$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 5:
To find the median of the 7 states, we have to order them from least to greatest:  
$19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%$  

The median is the fourth number because there are 3 numbers less than $25.9\%$ and 3 numbers greater than $25.9\%$.

Therefore, the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher of the 7 states is $25.9 \%$. The difference between the median for these 7 states and for all 50 states is $26.95\%-25.9\%=1.05\%$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
We need to find the median of the given 7 data points (percentages), which are $19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, and $36.4 \%$. We reorder the percentages from least to greatest: $$19.5 \%,21.9 \%,25.9 \%,27.9 \%,30.1 \%,35.5 \%,36.4 \%.$$Since we have 7 data points, the median is the fourth data point from either end (or the average of the fourth and fifth data points). Here, the median is $27.9 \%$ (or the average of $27.9 \%$ and $30.1 \%$ which is $29 \%$). The difference between this $27.9 \%$ and the given median of $26.95 \%$ is $27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 7:
First, we need to arrange the $7$ percent values in the ascending order to find the median:

$19.5 \%, 21.9 \%, 25.9 \%, 27.9 \%, 30.1 \%, 35.5 \%, 36.4 \%$

The median of this data set is $27.9 \%$

The difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these $7$ states and the median for all $50$ states is:

$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$

So, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 0.95 \%}$.
Response 8:
Firstly, we write the percents in increasing order, so we get, $19.5 \%, 21.9 \%, 25.9 \%, 27.9 \%, 30.1 \%, 35.5 \%, 36.4 \%$.
The median of the 7 states is the average of $25.9 \%$ and $27.9 \%$, which is $26.9 \%$.
The difference between $26.9 \%$ and $26.95 \%$ is $0.05 \%$.
Therefore, the answer is A: `$0.05 \%$`. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
We first need to rank the seven states' data to find the median. We have,

$(19.5), 21.9, 25.9, (27.9), (30.1), (35.5), 36.4$
 
where the numbers in the parentheses are above the national median of $26.95 \%$. The median percent for these seven states is $\frac{27.9 + 30.1}{2} = 29 \%$. Thus, the difference between the median for these seven states and the median for all 50 states is $29 - 26.95 = 2.05$. So the answer is  $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)\ } 1.22 \%}$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}Year & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Subscriptions } \\ \text { sold }\end{array}$ \\\hline2012 & 5,600 \\2013 & 5,880 \\\end{tabular}\end{center}The manager of an online news service received the report above on the number of subscriptions sold by the service. The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
We are given information on the number of subscriptions sold in 2012 and 2013. Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013. We are told that $x$ increased by double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 to give us the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014. The percent increase from 2013 to 2014 can be calculated by $\frac{5880-x}{x}$. Therefore, the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $x\cdot \left(1+\frac{2(5880-x)}{x}\right)$. We want to solve for this expression to get our answer. 

Expanding, we get $x\cdot\left(1+\frac{11760-2x}{x}\right) = x + 11760 - 2x = 11760 - x$. We know that $x = 5880$ corresponds to a percent increase of $100\%$, so to double this increase, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $200\%$. Thus, we expect $5880\cdot 4 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }6,468}$ subscriptions to be sold in 2014.
Response 1:
First, let's find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013:
$ \frac{(5880-5600)}{5600} \times 100\% = 5\% $  
Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, as per the problem, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is twice that of x:  
$ 2x = 5\% \Rightarrow x = 2.5\% $  
Let 2013 subscriptions sold be "y". To find the number of subscriptions in 2014, we need to add y and the percent increase of subscriptions from 2013 to 2014:  
$ y(1+0.025) = 5880(1+0.05)(1+0.025) \approx 6,027 $  

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
We are not provided with the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, and we are not given the actual percent increases for either year. Because of this, we can assign variables to represent the percent increases and write equations based on the information we are given.

Let x be the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. Then the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is 0.5x, since it is half of the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 (as stated in the problem). Let y be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 (since we are trying to find the number sold in 2014).

Using the given information, we can set up the following equations:
- 5,880 = 5,600(1 + x)
- y = 5,880(1 + 0.5x)

We can solve for x by simplifying the first equation:
- 5,880 = 5,600 + 5,600x
- 280 = 5,600x
- x = 0.05

Then we can solve for y by plugging in x to the second equation:
- y = 5,880(1 + 0.5(0.05))
- y = 6,027

Therefore, the manager expected 6,027 subscriptions to be sold in 2014. The answer is (B) 6,027.
Response 3:
Let's first calculate the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. 

To get from 5,600 to 5,880, we need to increase by 280. 

The percent increase is then: 

percent increase $= \frac{\text{amount of increase}}{\text{original amount}} \cdot 100\% = \frac{280}{5600} \cdot 100\% = 5\%$

Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013. Then, to get to the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, we need to increase by:

amount of increase $= 2 \cdot 5\% \cdot x = 0.1x$

So the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is:

$x + 0.1x = 1.1x$

We know that $x = 5,880$, so:

$1.1x = 1.1\times 5,880 = 6,468$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
This question cannot be answered as it requires information about the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, which is not provided in the given data.
Response 5:
Assuming that the last year mentioned in the question is a typo, and it should say "from 2013 to 2014" instead of "from 2013 to 2013":

Action: Answer("A")  
The problem gives us data for 2012 and 2013, and we're asked to estimate the subscriptions sold in 2014. Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. From the problem, we know:

\begin{align*}
\text{percent increase from 2012 to 2013} &= \frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.050 \\
\text{percent increase from 2013 to 2014} &= 2 \cdot \frac{x-5880}{5880} = \frac{2x}{5880} - \frac{2}{3} \\
\end{align*}

To find $x$, we need to solve for $x$ in the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{5880} - \frac{2}{3} = 0.050 \]

Solving for $x$, we get $x \approx 6{,}019.7$, which we can round to $6{,}020$. Therefore, the closest estimate to the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 6,020}$.
Response 6:
Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013. Then based on the given information, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 would be $x + 2(x - 5,880)$. Simplifying, we get $3x - 11,760$. 

We can solve for $x$ by finding the percentage increase from 2012 to 2013, and then using that to find out how many subscriptions were sold in 2013. The percent increase is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \cdot 100 = 5\%$. 

So, the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 was $5,880 + 5\% \cdot 5,880 = 6,174$. 

Finally, to find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, we substitute $x = 6,174$ into our formula and get $3 \cdot 6174 - 11760 = 6,468$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 6,468}$.
Response 7:
No information is given regarding the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Therefore, the correct choice can be determined directly from the answer choices. Since the manager estimated that the percent increase in subscriptions sold from 2012 to 2013 was the same as the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 should be greater than 5,880 + 2(280) = 6,440. Out of the answer choices, only $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 6,468}$ is greater than 6,440.
Response 8:
This question cannot be answered as information on subscriptions sold for 2014 is not given.
Response 9:
The problem mentions a percent increase from 2012 to 2013 and another percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Let $x$ be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Therefore, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{2x}{100}$. Using this, we can set up the equation $\frac{2x}{100} = \frac{5880-5600}{5600}$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 5$. Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $5880\times\left(1 + \frac{5}{100}\right)= \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 6,027}.$

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A customer paid $\$ 53.00$ for a jacket after a 6 percent sales tax was added. What was the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 47.60$
  B: $\$ 50.00$
  C: $\$ 52.60$
  D: $\$ 52.84$
Response 0:
Let $x$ be the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added. 

To find $x$, we need to subtract the sales tax from the total price paid:
$$x+0.06x = 53.00$$
Simplifying and solving for $x$:
$$1.06x = 53.00$$
$$x=\frac{53.00}{1.06} \approx 50$$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we need to go backwards. If the customer paid $\$ 53.00$ for the jacket after a $6\%$ sales tax was applied, then the price of the jacket before the tax was added must have been the original price, $x$, plus $6\%$ of that price. In other words, the total price was:

$$x + 0.06x$$

which simplifies to:

$$1.06x$$

We know that the total price was $\$ 53.00$. So we can set up the equation:

$$1.06x = 53$$

Solving for $x$:

$$x = \frac{53}{1.06} = 50$$

So the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added was $\$ 50.00$. Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let x be the price of jacket before the sales tax was added.
Total amount paid after adding 6% sales tax = x + 6% of x = x + 0.06x = 1.06x
Also given that total amount paid after adding 6% of sales tax is $53.00.
So the equation is 1.06x = 53.00
Solving the above equation gives x = 50
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
We can use the following formula to solve the problem:
$$\mathrm{Price~before~tax} = \frac{\mathrm{Price~after~tax}}{1 + \mathrm{Tax~rate}}$$

Action: Answer("A") since:

$$\mathrm{Price~before~tax} = \frac{\$ 53.00}{1+0.06} = \$ 47.60$$
Response 5:
Let the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added be $x$.

The price after the tax was added is $x + 0.06x = 1.06x$.

We know that the final price after tax is $\$ 53.00$.

So,  $1.06x$ = $\$ 53.00$ 

Solving for $x$, we get $x=50$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let x be the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added.

The total cost after 6% sales tax was added can be expressed as:

x + 0.06x = 53

Combining like terms, we get:

1.06x = 53

Dividing both sides by 1.06, we get:

x = 50

Therefore, the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added was $\$ 50.00$.

Response 5:
First simplify both expressions inside the brackets. 

The first bracket simplifies to:

$$\begin{aligned} x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2} &= x^{2} y+5 x y^{2}-3 y^{2} \end{aligned}$$

The second bracket simplifies to:

$$\begin{aligned} -x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2} &= 3x y^{2}-x^{2} y-3 y^{2} \end{aligned}$$

Now, when we subtract the second bracket from the first one we get:

$$\begin{aligned} [(x^{2} y+5 x y^{2}-3 y^{2})] - [ (3x y^{2}-x^{2} y-3 y^{2})] &=  (x^{2} y+5 x y^{2}-3 y^{2})+ (x^{2}y-3xy^{2}+3y^{2}) \\ &= \boxed{2 x^{2} y+8 x y^{2}-6 y^{2}} \end{aligned} $$

Therefore, the correct answer is D. $2 x^{2} y+8 x y^{2}-6 y^{2}$.
Response 6:
Expanding the expression gives: $$\left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right) = x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}+x^{2} y-3 x y^{2}+3 y^{2} = 2 x^{2} y+8 x y^{2}-6 y^{2}$$

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company purchased a machine valued at $\$ 120,000$. The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year so that after 10 years the value will be $\$ 30,000$. Which of the following equations gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased for $0 \leq t \leq 10 ?$
Choices:
  A: $v=30,000-9,000 t$
  B: $v=120,000-9,000 t$
  C: $v=120,000+9,000 t$
  D: $v=120,000-30,000 t$
Response 0:
We can begin with the initial value of the machine, $v_0=120,000$, and the final value, $v_f=30,000$, after 10 years, to write the equation of a straight line passing through $(0,120,000)$ and $(10,30,000)$. The slope of this line, $m$, is given by:
$$m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{v_f-v_0}{t_f-t_0}=\frac{30,000-120,000}{10-0}=-9,000$$
where $t_0=0$ and $t_f=10$. Since the value decreases linearly with time, the function that describes this behavior is:
$$v(t) = v_0 + m(t-t_0)=120,000-9,000t$$
Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Since the value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year, we can model the depreciation with a linear function in terms of $t$. The initial value of the machine is $v(0) = 120,000$, and after $10$ years the value of the machine is $v(10) = 30,000$. The equation of the line passing through these two points is:

$$
v(t) = \frac{30,000 - 120,000}{10 - 0}t + 120,000 = -9,000t + 120,000.
$$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $v=120,000-9,000 t$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
To find the rate of depreciation we can calculate: 

$$\frac{120000-30000}{10} = 9000$$

Therefore the value of the machine, $v$, t years after it was purchased is given by:

$$\begin{aligned} v & = 120000 - 9000t \\ & = 30000 + 9000(10-t) \\ \end{aligned}$$

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
The machine is purchased for $\$120,000$, and its value depreciates by the same amount each year for a total of $10$ years when it has depreciated to $\$ 30,000$. It means that the value of the machine decreases by $\dfrac{120,000-30,000}{10} = $ $\$9,000$ each year. 

Therefore, the current value, $v$, of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased is given by:

$v=120,000-9,000t$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
We can find the depreciation per year by dividing the total depreciation by the number of years: $$\frac{120,000-30,000}{10}=9,000.$$ So each year, the value of the machine decreases by $9,000$ dollars. After $t$ years, the machine would have decreased in value by $9,000t$ dollars. Thus, the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased can be found by subtracting this amount from the initial value of $120,000$: $$v=120,000-9,000t.$$ Hence, the answer is (B): $v=120,000-9,000 t$.
Response 7:
We can see that over $10$ years, the value of the machine depreciates by a total of $120,000-30,000 = 90,000$ dollars. Since the value decreases by the same amount each year, it should decrease by $\frac{90,000}{10} = 9,000$ dollars per year. 

When the machine is first purchased, $t=0$, so the value of the machine is $v=120,000$. As each year passes, the value decreases by $9,000$ dollars, so we can write the equation as $v=120,000-9,000t.$ 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
The machine depreciates by the same amount each year. So the rate of depreciation is constant. Let the value of each year's depreciation be $x$.   
The initial value of the machine is $\$ 120,000$, and the value of the machine after 10 years will be $\$ 30,000$. After $t$ years, the value of the machine will be $120000 - xt$ dollars. We need to find the equation that represents this relation.  
To find the value of $x$, we use the information that the value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year: 

The value of the machine after 10 years is $30,000$, which is $120,000 - 10x$.  
Solving for $x$ gives $x = 9,000$. 

So the value of machine after $t$ years is $v = 120,000 - 9,000t$.  

Therefore,

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& x=y-3 \\& \frac{x}{2}+2 y=6\end{aligned}$$Which ordered pair $(x, y)$ satisfies the system of equations shown above?
Choices:
  A: $(-3,0)$
  B: $(0,3)$
  C: $(6,-3)$
  D: $(36,-6)$
Response 0:
We can solve the system of equations by substitution method.
Substituting $x=y-3$ in the second equation yields $\dfrac{y-3}{2}+2y=6$. Solving for $y$, we have $y=3$.
Substituting $y=3$ in the equation $x=y-3$, we have $x=0$.
Therefore, the ordered pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the system of equation is $(0,3)$.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get $2x=2y-6$. Thus, the system can be rewritten as:
$$\begin{aligned}& 2x=2y-6 \\& \frac{x}{2}+2y=6\end{aligned}$$
Adding two times the first equation to the second, we eliminate $x$ and get:
$$5y = 6+12 \Rightarrow y=3$$
Substituting back $y=3$ into $x=y-3$, we get $x=0$. Therefore, the ordered pair $(x,y)=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\;(0,3)}$.
Response 2:
First we substitute the value of $x$ from equation 1 into equation 2 to get: $$\frac{y-3}{2} + 2y = 6$$ We then simplify this equation, $$\begin{aligned} \frac{y-3}{2} + 2y &= 6 \\ y -3 + 4y &= 12 \\ 5y &= 15 \\ y &= 3 \end{aligned} $$ To find the value of $x$, we substitute $y=3$ into equation 1: $$x = y - 3 = 0$$ Therefore, the solution is $(x,y) = \boxed{\textbf{(B) } (0,3)}.$
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
We can solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination method. Here is the solution using the substitution method:

$$\begin{aligned} &x=y-3 \\ &\frac{x}{2}+2y=6 \end{aligned}$$

Substituting $x=y-3$ into the second equation yields:

$$\frac{y-3}{2}+2y=6$$

Simplifying the expression gives:

$$\frac{y}{2}+2y-3=6$$

Combining like terms gives:

$$\frac{5y}{2}=9$$

Multiplying both sides by $\frac{2}{5}$ gives:

$$y=\frac{18}{5}$$

Substituting $y=\frac{18}{5}$ into the first equation gives:

$$x=\frac{18}{5}-3=-\frac{3}{5}$$

Therefore, the solution of the system of equations is $(x,y)=\left(-\frac{3}{5}, \frac{18}{5}\right)$

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Substitute $x$ in terms of $y$ from the first equation into the second equation and solve for $y$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Substituting the value of $x$ in second equation, we get $\frac{y-3}{2}+2y=6 \implies y=3$. 
Put the value of $y$ in first equation, we get $x=0$. 
Therefore, the solution is $(0,3)$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
We can solve the system of equations by substituting the value of $x$ in the second equation with $y-3$ from the first equation, and then solving for $y$: 

$$\begin{aligned} \frac{x}{2}+2y &= 6 \\ \frac{y-3}{2}+2y &= 6 \\ 2y-3+4y &= 12 \\ 6y &= 15 \\ y &= \frac{5}{2} \end{aligned}$$

Then, we can substitute $y=\frac{5}{2}$ back into the first equation to solve for $x$:

$$\begin{aligned} x &= y-3 \\ x &= \frac{5}{2} - 3 \\ x &= -\frac{1}{2} \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the ordered pair $(x,y)=(-\frac{1}{2},\frac{5}{2})$, which means the answer is: 

Action: Answer("None of the above")  (because the answer is not one of the given choices)
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 

Substitute the value of $x$ in the second equation and solve for $y$.
$$\frac{x}{2}+2y=6$$
$$\frac{(y-3)}{2}+2y=6$$
$$\frac{y-3+4y}{2}=6$$
$$5y-3=12$$
$$5y=15$$
$$y=3$$

Substitute the value of $y$ in the first equation and solve for $x$.
$$x=y-3$$
$$x=3-3$$
$$x=0$$

So the ordered pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the given system of equations is $(0,3)$, and the correct answer is (B).

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week?
Choices:
  A: 38
  B: 33
  C: 22
  D: 16
Response 0:
Let the required number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week be $x$.
For the first 10 hours, he earns $8 \cdot 10 = 80$ dollars. For the remaining  $x$ hours, he earns $10x$ dollars.
He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so we have that $0.90(80 + 10x) \geq 270$, which simplifies to $x \geq 22$. 
Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$270$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 1:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken has to work the rest of the week. If he works $x$ number of hours, he makes:
$$8\cdot10+(x)(10)=80+10x$$
Ken saves 90 percent of this amount, which is equal to:
$$0.9\cdot (80+10x) = 72+9x$$
To solve for $x$, we solve the inequality:
$$72+9x \geq 270$$
$$9x\geq198$$
$$x\geq22$$
This means the least number of hours Ken has to work the rest of the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$ hours.
Response 2:
Since he has already worked 10 hours, let us assume that he needs to work $x$ hours to earn at least $270$ dollars. 

In the first 10 hours, he earned $8\times 10=80$ dollars. He now needs to earn an additional $270-80=190$ dollars.

For each of the remaining hours, he earns $\$10$ and saves $90\%$ of it, so he actually earns $\$10 \times 0.1 = \$1$ for each of the remaining hours. Let $y$ denote the number of hours he needs to work at this rate to earn at least $\$190$.

So we can set up the equation $y \times 1 \geq 190$. Solving this inequality, we get $y \geq 190$, or $y \geq 190/1=190$.

Adding this to the 10 hours already worked, we get $10 + 190 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }38}$. 

Therefore, Ken must work for at least $38$ hours to save at least $\$270$ from his earnings.
Response 3:
Let's first compute Ken's wage for the first 10 hours. He earned $10$ dollars per hour for the rest of the week, so let $x$ be the number of hours he must work the rest of the week. Thus, he earned $$
10x + 8(10) = 10x + 80
$$dollars for the entire week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from this week, which means he saves $$
0.9\cdot(10x+80) = 9x + 72
$$dollars. We must have $9x + 72 \geq 270$, which we solve to obtain $x \geq 22$. So, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 22}$.
Response 4:
Let $x$ be the number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$. Then we can write the following equation: $$0.9(10 \cdot 10 + 10x) \geq 270$$ Simplifying this, we get: $$9(10+x) \geq 300 \Rightarrow x \geq \frac{210}{9}$$ So the smallest integer number of hours Ken must work is $\left\lceil \frac{210}{9} \right\rceil = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } 38}.$
Response 5:
Let the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week be $x$. From the information given, we can write the equation: $$0.9\left( (10)(10)+ (8)(x)\right)\geq 270 $$ Simplifying and dividing by $0.9$, we have: $$100 + 8x \geq 300 $$ Solving for $x$, we get $x \geq 25$. Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $x=25$. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken worked after the first 10 hours in the week. His total earnings for the week would then be $8\cdot 10 + 10x = 80 + 10x$. The amount Ken saves for the week is $0.9(80+10x)$. We want to determine $x$ such that $0.9(80+10x) \geq 270$. Solving this inequality gives $x \geq 19$, so the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week is $19$. This means he worked a total of $10+19=29$ hours for the week. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")  $\boxed{\text{A)}\ 38 }$
Response 7:
Let the number of hours worked after the first day be $x.$ Ken worked $10$ hours the first day, so he worked a total of $10 + x$ hours. In order for Ken to save at least $\$ 270$, his savings for the week cannot be less than $\$ 770.$ Thus, we must have $0.9[(10)(8)+(10+x)(10)]\geq 770.$ Solving for $x$ yields $x\geq14.$ The smallest solution choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 16}.$ 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let x be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week. Then we have the total earnings from his work this week:
\begin{align*} 
\text{Total Earnings} &= (\$ 8/hour)\cdot(10 \text{ hours}) + (\$ 10/hour)\cdot x \\
&= 80 + 10x
\end{align*}
Ken saves 90% of $\text{Total Earnings}$, which means his savings is:
$$0.90(80 + 10x) = 72 + 9x$$
We want his savings to be at least $\$270$ for the week, so we have the inequality:
\begin{align*}
72+9x &\ge 270 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad 9x &\ge 198 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad x &\ge 22
\end{align*}
Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$270$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 9:
Let the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week be $h.$ Then the amount of money he earns for the entire week is $$8\cdot 10+10h=80+10h$$He saves $90 \%$ of $\$ (80+10h)$ which is $\$ 72+9h.$ We want to solve $$\$ 72 + 9h \geq \$ 270$$Subtracting $\$ 72$ from both sides gives $$9h \geq \$ 198$$Dividing both sides by $9$ gives $$h \geq 22$$Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}.$

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages. For each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. What is the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 6
Response 0:
Let x be the number of 100-pound packages and y be the number of 120-pound packages. From the problem:

- x + y ≥ 10
- 100x + 120y ≤ 1100

We want to maximize y. We can rearrange the first inequality as y ≥ -x + 10, which means y takes on its minimum value when x takes on its maximum value. From the second inequality, we can simplify to 5x + 6y ≤ 55. If we set x = 4, then 6y ≤ 55 - 5(4) = 35, which gives the maximum value of y as 5 (since y must be an integer). Therefore, 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let's denote the number of 100-pound packages as x and the number of 120-pound packages as y. We know that:
1) The total number of packages must be at least 10: x + y >= 10
2) The total weight of the packages can be at most 1100 pounds: 100x + 120y <= 1100

To maximize y, we need to use these two inequalities to set up an equation with y on one side and everything else on the other side:
y <= (1100 - 100x) / 120
We want to maximize y, which means we want to make this fraction as large as possible. Since x and y must be integers, we should start by plugging in integer values for x and seeing what values we get for y. We can then choose the largest integer value of y that satisfies the inequality.

Let's try x = 4:
y <= (1100 - 100(4)) / 120 = 5

This tells us that if we load 4 100-pound packages and 5 120-pound packages, we'll be under the weight limit. We can check that this is the maximum number of 120-pound packages by trying x = 3:

y <= (1100 - 100(3)) / 120 = 4.25

This means that we could load 3 100-pound packages and 4 120-pound packages, but doing so would put us over the weight limit. Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages we can carry is 5.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's represent the number of 100-pound packages with x and the number of 120-pound packages with y. We know that:
- x + y ≥ 10, meaning that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages per trip
- 100x + 120y ≤ 1100, meaning that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds.

We want to find the maximum number of 120-pound packages the helicopter can carry per trip, which is y. Let's solve for y.

100x + 120y ≤ 1100
Divide both sides by 20:
5x + 6y ≤ 55
Subtract 5x from both sides:
6y ≤ 55 - 5x
Divide both sides by 6 (keeping in mind that y must be an integer):
y ≤ (55 - 5x) / 6

Now we can try different values of x to see the largest integer value of y that satisfies the inequality. If x = 8, then y ≤ (55 - 5(8)) / 6 = 3.33, which means that y can be at most 3. If x = 7, then y ≤ (55 - 5(7)) / 6 = 4, which means that y can be at most 4. If x = 6, then y ≤ (55 - 5(6)) / 6 = 4.16, which means that y can be at most 4. If x = 5, then y ≤ (55 - 5(5)) / 6 = 4.16, which means that y can be at most 4. If x = 4, then y ≤ (55 - 5(4)) / 6 = 4.5, which means that y can be at most 4.

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 4, which is choice B. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's assume that x is the number of 100-pound packages and y is the number of 120-pound packages.
We can write the following system of inequalities:
* x + y ≥ 10 (the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
* 100x + 120y ≤ 1100 (the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)
We want to maximize y, so let's solve the second inequality for y:
y ≤ (1100-100x)/120
Now we can combine the two inequalities:
x + y ≥ 10
y ≤ (1100-100x)/120
We can graph this system of inequalities, but we can also try some values of x and see what happens to y:
* If x=0, then y≤(1100-0)/120=9.166, so y can be at most 9.
* If x=1, then y≤(1100-100)/120=8.333, so y can be at most 8.
* If x=2, then y≤(1100-200)/120=7.5, so y can be at most 7.
* If x=3, then y≤(1100-300)/120=6.666, so y can be at most 6.
* If x=4, then y≤(1100-400)/120=5.833, so y can be at most 5.
* If x=5, then y≤(1100-500)/120=5, so y can be at most 5.
Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 6.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries "x" 120-pound packages and "y" 100-pound packages. Based on the given constraints, we can form a system of inequalities:
```
x + y >= 10        (The helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
120x + 100y <= 1100  (The total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)
```
To make things easier, we can simplify the second inequality by dividing both sides by 20:
```
6x + 5y <= 55
```
Now we can graph the system of inequalities on the xy-plane and shade the feasible region (i.e. the region that satisfies both inequalities):
graph{6x+5y<=55 [-2, 12, -2, 12]}
The corner points of the feasible region are (0, 10), (5.5, 1), and (9, 0). To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, we need to check the value of "x" at each corner point and see which one gives the largest integer value. 
- At (0, 10), x = 0, which means that all packages are 100-pound packages.
- At (5.5, 1), x = 1, which means that the helicopter can carry at most one 120-pound package.
- At (9, 0), x = 3, which means that the helicopter can carry at most three 120-pound packages.

Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 3.
 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's assume that the helicopter carries "x" number of 120-pound packages and "y" number of 100-pound packages.
Based on the given information, we can form the following inequalities:
  120x + 100y ≤ 1,100 (total weight of packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)
  x + y ≥ 10 (helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
 
Now, let's solve for "x":
  x ≤ (1,100 - 100y)/120
  x ≥ 10 - y
  
To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, we need to minimize the number of 100-pound packages. Therefore, let's assume that the helicopter only carries 100-pound packages. In this case, it can carry a maximum of 11 packages (11 x 100 = 1,100). 

Let's now substitute "y" with 10 - "x" in the first inequality:
  120x + 100(10 - x) ≤ 1,100
  20x ≤ 100
  x ≤ 5
  
Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry is 5.

Choices:
  A: $x-2$
  B: $x-3$
  C: $x-4$

Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
We can see that $f(2) = 1$, and $f(4) = 0$. Therefore, $x-2$ and $x-4$ must be factors of $f(x)$, leaving the answer as: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
We can use the factor theorem to check the factors. 

If $f(2)=1,$ then $(x-2)$ is not a factor of $f(x)$ which means we can eliminate choices A and D. 

If $f(4)=0,$ then $(x-4)$ must be a factor of $f(x)$ which means the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}}$
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A") 

We can quickly see from the table that $f(2) = 1$ and $f(0) = 3$, so the point $(2,1)$ lies on the graph of $f$ and the point $(0,3)$ lies on the graph of $y - f(x)$. Because $f$ is defined by a polynomial, it must be continuous, so at some point between $x = 2$ and $x = 0$, $f(x)$ intersects the $x$-axis. At that point, $x - 2$ must be a factor of $f(x)$, so $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } x-2}$ is the answer.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A") 

We can observe that $f(2) = 1$, and as a result, $x-2$ is a factor of $f(x)$ by the Factor Theorem. We know that neither $x-3$, $x-4$, nor $x-5$ are factors of $f(x)$ because $f(3)=f(4)=f(5)\neq 0$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
We can see that $f(2) = 1$ and $f(5) = -2$. Hence, the polynomial $f(x)$ must have roots at $x=2$ and $x=5$, which implies that $(x-2)$ and $(x-5)$ are factors of $f(x)$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Solution: 

Notice that $i^{2}=-1,$ so $\left(9 i^{2}-6 i\right) = (9)(-1) -6i = -9-6i.$ 

Therefore, $(5+12i) - \left(9i^{2} -6i\right) = (5+12i) - (-9- 6i) = \boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\; 4+6i}.$
Response 7:

Explanation:
$i^2=-1$, so $9i^2=-9$. 
Substituting $i^2=-1$, we have $(5+12i)-(9i^2-6i)=(5+12i)-(-9-6i)$ which simplifies to $5+12i+9+6i=14+18i$.

Response 1:
We need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ using the equation of the line $y=25$: 
\begin{align*}
25&=(x-11)^2\\
5&=|x-11|

Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Since the equation given is $y = (x - 11)^2$, the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ satisfy the equation $(x-11)^{2} = 25$. Taking the square root of both sides of the equation gives $x - 11 = 5$ or $x - 11 = -5$, so $x$ equals $16$ or $6$. Hence, the length of segment $\overline{AB}$ is $|16-6| = 10$, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }10}$.
Response 6:
We solve first for $A$ and $B$. Substituting $y=25$ into the equation of the parabola, we get $25 = (x - 11)^2$, which implies $x=11 \pm 5$. Hence, the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $6$ and $16$, respectively. Thus, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $16-6=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\; 10}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
We set $(x-11)^{2}=25$ and obtain $x=1$ or $x=21$. Since the parabola is symmetric about $x=11$, the two $y$-coordinates of the intersection points are the same distance from the axis of symmetry, so they are equidistant from it; therefore, the distance between them is $21-1=20$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 16}$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$
Response 0:
To find the function that models the oil and gas production, we need to determine the slope of the line using the given information:
- In 2000, the production was 4 million barrels
- In 2013 (13 years later), the production was 1.9 million barrels
The slope is equal to the change in the output variable (production) over the change in the input variable (time). Therefore, we have:
slope $= \frac{1.9-4}{13-0} = -\frac{21}{130}$
The y-intercept of the function should be the initial production, which is 4. Therefore, the function that models the production is:
$f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To find the best linear function $f$ that models oil and gas production, we need to use two points on the line:
- In the year 2000, $t=0$ and $f(0)=4$. So the point $(0,4)$ is on the line.
- In the year 2013, $t=13$ and $f(13)=1.9$.  So the point $(13,1.9)$ is also on the line.
Using the two points $(0,4)$ and $(13,1.9)$, we can calculate the slope of the line:
$$m = \frac{1.9 - 4}{13 - 0} = -\frac{21}{130}$$
Using point-slope form, the equation of the line is:
$$f(t) - 4 = -\frac{21}{130} t$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$f(t) = -\frac{21}{130} t + 4$$
Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
To find the best linear function that models the oil and gas production in millions of barrels, we need to use the point-slope formula. 
$f(t) = \frac{(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)}(t - x_1) + y_1$, where $x_1$, $y_1$  correspond to the initial year production, and $x_2$, $y_2$ correspond to the production after the $t$ years, where $t$ is the number of years that have elapsed since the year 2000. 

We have $x_1 = 0$ (since we start counting at the year 2000), $y_1=4$, $y_2=1.9$, and $x_2=13$. 

Then, we get: 

$f(t) = \frac{(1.9-4)}{(13-0)}(t-0) + 4 = -\frac{21}{130}t+4 \implies \boxed{\textbf{C}}$ is the correct choice.
Response 3:
Let's calculate the rate of decrease. We want to find how much it dropped over how many years. Since it dropped from 4 million to 1.9 million over 13 years (2000 to 2013), we can calculate the rate of decrease as:

$$\text{rate of decrease} = \frac{4-1.9}{13} = \frac{21}{130}$$

Now we want a linear function that will give us the estimated production at any year after 2000. We can use the point-slope formula and the point $(0,4)$ (since in the year 2000, the production was 4 million barrels) to write the equation.

$$ f(t)-4 = \frac{21}{130} t $$

Solving for $f(t)$, we get:

$$ f(t) = \frac{21}{130} t + 4 $$

So the answer is (A) $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
Response 4:
To find the linear function that best models the problem, we need to find the slope of the line. Since the oil and gas production decreased from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, a change of -2.1 million barrels took place over 13 years (2013 - 2000 = 13). Therefore, the rate of change or the slope is:

$$
m = \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x} = \frac{-2.1}{13} = -\frac{21}{130}
$$

The y-intercept of the line is 4. Therefore, the equation of the line is:

$$
f(t) = -\frac{21}{130} t + 4
$$

Answer: Answer(C)
Response 5:
The production in 2013 was 1.9 million barrels, which is 2.1 million barrels fewer than in 2000. This decrease occurred over a period of 13 years. Therefore, the production decreased at an average rate of $\frac{2.1}{13}\approx 0.16154$ million barrels per year. 

This means that the slope of the linear function that models this production should be approximately $-0.16154$. 

All of the given functions have a slope that is a fraction with a numerator of $19$ or $21$, which are too far from the slope we calculated. 

Therefore, the most appropriate function is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
To determine the best model for this problem, we can use the slope-intercept form of a linear function $f(t) = mt + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.

The production decreased from 4 million to 1.9 million over a period of 13 years (2013 - 2000 = 13 years). Therefore, the rate of decrease in production is:

$$m = \frac{1.9-4}{13} = -\frac{210}{130} = -\frac{21}{13}$$

To find the y-intercept, we can use any point on the line. For instance, we can use the point $(0, 4)$ since the production in 2000 was 4 million barrels.

Therefore, the equation of the linear function that best models the production is:

$$f(t) = -\frac{21}{13}t + 4$$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To find the linear function that models the oil and gas production, we need to use the slope-intercept form $y=mx+b$, where $y$ is the oil and gas production in millions of barrels and $x$ is the number of years since 2000.

From 2000 to 2013 is a span of 13 years, which means the oil and gas production decreased by $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels during these 13 years. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13}=\frac{21}{130}$ million barrels per year.

The initial production in 2000 is 4 million barrels, so the $y$-intercept is 4. Therefore, the linear function that models the production is $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
The amount of oil and gas production decreased from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of 4-1.9 = 2.1 million barrels over 13 years. Hence a linear function that passes through $(0, 4)$ and $(13, 1.9)$ can be used to model oil and gas production.  The slope of the line will give the rate of decrease of the production and the y-intercept will give the initial production quantity. 
We get $\displaystyle\text{slope} = \frac{1.9-4}{13-0} = -\frac{21}{130}$. 

Hence, the best linear function that models the oil and gas production is $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4.$

Thus, the answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.
Response 9:
We can use the slope-intercept form of the linear function $f(t) = mt + b$ to solve the problem, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the initial production.
The initial production is $4$ million barrels in 2000, so $b=4$.
The production dropped from $4$ million barrels in 2000 to $1.9$ million barrels in 2013, which is $13$ years later. Therefore, the rate of change of the production is
$$m = \frac{\text{change in production}}{\text{change in time}} = \frac{1.9-4}{13} = -\frac{21}{130}.$$
Thus, the linear function that models the production is $f(t) = -\frac{21}{130} t + 4$, which is choice $\textbf{(C)}$.

Response 9:
Let the original price of the property be $x$. After a $40 \%$ discount, the price becomes $0.6x$. Then, it gets an additional $20 \%$ off, so the final price becomes $0.8(0.6x) = 0.48x$. We know that $0.48x$ is the final price Townsend Realty paid in cash, so we can set up an equation: $0.48x = $ price paid in cash. Therefore, we have $0.48x =  price\;of\;Glenview\;Street\;property \times 0.6\times0.8$. Solving for $x$, we get $x =  price\;of\;Glenview\;Street\;property = 40\% \;discount +\ 20\% \;off \;fully \;discounted \;price = 0.6(0.8x) = 0.48x \div 0.48 = x = 0.6(0.8)\times$ price paid in cash. Therefore, a good approximation of the original price is $\approx 0.6(0.8)(\$291,700) = \$140,736. Answer(\textbf{C})$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The formula below is often used by project managers to compute $E$, the estimated time to complete a job, where $O$ is the shortest completion time, $P$ is the longest completion time, and $M$ is the most likely completion time.$$E=\frac{O+4 M+P}{6}$$Which of the following correctly gives $P$ in terms of $E, O$, and $M$ ?
Choices:
  A: $P=6 E-O-4 M$
  B: $P=-6 E+O+4 M$
  C: $P=\frac{O+4 M+E}{6}$
  D: $P=\frac{O+4 M-E}{6}$
Response 0:
We can rearrange the formula $E=\frac{O+4M+P}{6}$ to give $P=6E-O-4M$. That gives us $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ P=6E-O-4M}$.
Response 1:
To solve for $P$ in terms of $E$, $O$, and $M$, we can rearrange the given formula as follows:

\begin{align*}
E&=\frac{O+4M+P}{6}\\
6E&= O+4M+P\\
P&=6E-O-4M
\end{align*} 

Thus, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
We can solve the given equation for $P$ by multiplying both sides by $6$ and then solve for $P$. 
\begin{align*}
E &=\frac{O+4 M+P}{6}\\
6E &= O + 4M + P\\
P &= 6E-O-4M
\end{align*}
So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } P=6E-O-4M}$.
Response 3:
We can solve equation $E=\frac{O+4 M+P}{6}$ for $P$ giving \begin{align*}
6 E &= O + 4 M + P, \\
6 E - O - 4 M &= P.
\end{align*}Therefore, Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } P=6 E-O-4 M}$.
Response 4:
We can start by simplifying the given formula for $E$ to get: 
\begin{align*}
E=\frac{O+4 M+P}{6} &\implies  O+4 M+P=6E \\
&\implies P=6E-O-4M
\end{align*}
Thus, the answer is (A) $P=6E-O-4M$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
We can solve the given formula for $P$. 
\begin{align*}
E&=\frac{O+4 M+P}{6}\\
6E&=O+4M+P\\
P&=6E-O-4M
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is (A) $P=6 E-O-4 M$.
Response 6:
We can solve for $P$ by multiplying both sides of the formula by 6 and then re-arranging the terms:$$6E=O+4M+P$$$$\Rightarrow P=6E-O-4M$$Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
To obtain $P$, we can manipulate the given formula by solving for $P$:
\begin{align*}
E &= \frac{O+4 M+P}{6} \\
6E &= O+4 M+P \\
P &= 6E - O - 4M \\
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
To isolate $P$ on one side of the equation, we first multiply both sides by $6$ to get $6E=O+4M+P$. Then, we can subtract $O+4M$ from both sides to obtain $P=6E-O-4M$. 

Therefore, the answer is:

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline1 & 5 \\\hline3 & 13 \\\hline5 & 21 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of the linear function $f$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=2 x+3$
  B: $f(x)=3 x+2$
  C: $f(x)=4 x+1$
  D: $f(x)=5 x$
Response 0:
Let's calculate the slope of $f$ using two points from the table, say $(1,5)$ and $(5,21)$.

Slope $m$ is given by: $$m=\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{21-5}{5-1}=4$$

So, the slope of $f$ is 4. We can check that only $(C)$ defines a linear function with a slope of 4: $$f(x)=(4)x+1$$

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("C").
Response 1:
To find the equation that defines $f(x)$ we need to analyze the table and look for a pattern. Notice that as $x$ went up by $2$, the value of $f(x)$ went up by $8$. This means that the slope of the function is $4$. To verify this, we can calculate the slope between any two points in the table, for example the first and second row: 

$$\text{slope}=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4 $$

Therefore, we know that $f(x)$ has a slope of $4$, and we can find the vertical intercept by checking one of the points in the table, for example, when $x=1$, then $f(1)=5$. This gives us the point $(1,5)$, and using the slope-intercept form of a line, we can find the equation of the function:

$$ f(x)=\text{slope}\cdot x + \text{vertical intercept}= 4x + 1 $$

Therefore, the answer is  $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\  f(x)=4 x+1}$.
Response 2:
To find a linear function from the table, we first need to find the slope.
$$\text{slope } m = \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x} = \frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$$
We can use the coordinates (1,5) and (3,13) to find the slope.
$$m = \frac{13-5}{3-1} = 4$$
Now that we have the slope, we can use one of the coordinates and the slope to find the $y$-intercept ($b$).
Using the coordinate (1,5),
$$y=mx+b$$
$$5=4(1)+b$$
$$b=1$$
Finally, we have all the information to state the equation of the function:  
$$f(x)=4x+1$$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
We can see that when $x = 1$, $f(x) = 5$. We can use this information to determine the slope of the line.
$f(x) = mx + b$
$5 = m(1) + b$
$b = 5-m$
When $x = 3$, $f(x) = 13$. So we have
$13 = m(3) + (5-m) = 3m + 5 - m = 2m+5$
$2m = 8$
$m=4$
So $b=1$ since $5=m+b$.
Therefore, $f(x) = 4x+1$. 

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4x+1}$
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
We see that when $x = 1$, $f(x) = 5$. When $x = 3$, $f(x) = 13$. When $x = 5$, $f(x) = 21$. We can notice that as we increase the value of $x$ by $2$, the value of $f(x)$ increases by $8$. Therefore, this means the slope of the line would be $\dfrac{8}{2}=4$. Next, we know that when $x=0$, then $f(x) = 1$, so the $y$-intercept is $(0,1)$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(x) = 4x+1$. Hence the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}}$.
Response 7:
Notice that the difference between the $x$-values is constant, specifically equal to 2.  Similarly, the difference between consecutive $y$-values is constant, specifically equal to 8.  Therefore, we check answer choices and parameterize their slopes with $m$: $$
\begin{array}{c|c}
\textbf{Choice} & \textbf{Line} \\ \hline \\
f(x)=2x+3 & 2 \\
f(x)=3x+2 & 3 \\
f(x)=4x+1 & 4 \\
f(x)=5x & 5
\end{array}
$$ Since the slope of the line that passes through $(1, 5)$ and $(3, 13)$ is 4, we have that the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4 x+1}$.
Response 8:
We can use the two points $(1,5)$ and $(5,21)$ to find the slope and $y$-intercept of the linear function $f(x)$. The slope is $\frac{21-5}{5-1}=4$ and the $y$-intercept is $5-4(1)=1$. Therefore, the equation in slope-intercept form for the linear function $f(x)$ is $$f(x) = 4x + 1.$$ Thus, the correct answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To solve this problem, you can use the two-point form of the equation of a line, which states that for two distinct points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, the equation of the line that passes through them is given by $y-y_1=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}(x-x_1)$. In this case, we can use $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$, since they are two distinct points on the line. Then, we have $$f(x)-5=\frac{13-5}{3-1}(x-1),$$ which simplifies to $f(x)=4x+1$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4x+1}$.

Question: Dreams Recalled during One Week\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\hline& None & 1 to 4 & 5 or more & Total \\\hline\hlineGroup X & 15 & 28 & 57 & 100 \\\hlineGroup Y & 21 & 11 & 68 & 100 \\\hlineTotal & 36 & 39 & 125 & 200 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The data in the table above were produced by a sleep researcher studying the number of dreams people recall when asked to record their dreams for one week. Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$
Response 0:
The probability that a person did recall at least 1 dream is $\frac{125}{200} = \frac{5}{8}$. 
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{\text{Number of People in Group Y who Recalled at least 1 Dream}}{\text{Total Number of People who Recalled at least 1 Dream}} = \frac{68}{125} = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{79}{164}}$.
Response 1:
Out of the $39$ people who recalled at least one dream, $68$ belong to Group Y. Therefore, the probability of choosing a person from Group Y who recalled at least one dream is $\frac{68}{39}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Out of the 39 people who recalled 1 or more dreams in Group X, $39 - 15 = 24$ people recalled 5 or more dreams. Out of the 39 people who recalled 1 or more dreams in Group Y, $39 - 21 = 18$ people recalled 1 to 4 dreams. So, out of the 78 people who recalled 1 or more dreams, $24+68 = 92$ people belong to Group X or Group Y and who recalled at least $5$ dreams or more than $4$ dreams respectively. Hence, a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, then the probability that the person belongs to Group Y is $\frac{68}{92} = \frac{17}{23}.$

Action: Answer('C')
Response 3:
Out of the total of 125 people who recalled at least 1 dream, Group Y consisted of 11+68=79 people. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{\text{Number of people who recalled} \geq 1 \text{ dream in Group Y}}{\text{Total number of people who recalled} \geq 1 \text{ dream}} = \frac{79}{125} = \frac{79}{100}$$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Out of 39 people who recalled 1 or more dream,
- 28 belongs to Group X and 11 belongs to Group Y.
The probability that a person belonged to Group Y is:  
$$\frac{11}{39}$$

Simplifying, we get:
$$\frac{11}{39} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{11}{13} \times \frac{39}{100} \times \frac{200}{200}$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Out of the 39 people who recalled dreams from Group Y, 68 dreams were recalled by 21 + 11 + 68 = 100 people. So the probability that the person belongs to Group Y is given by:

$$
\frac{\text{Number of people who recalled 1 or more dreams in Group Y}}{\text{Total number of people who recalled 1 or more dreams}} = \frac{39}{39 + 28 + 57 + 11 + 68} = \frac{39}{203} = \frac{3}{17}
$$

Therefore the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{79}{164}}$.
Response 6:
The probability of selecting a person who recalled at least one dream is $\frac{39+125}{200} = \frac{164}{200}$. The probability of selecting a person who belonged to Group Y is $\frac{68}{164}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
For those who recalled at least 1 dream, there were 39 + 125 = 164 people. And out of these 164 people, 68 belong to Group Y. Thus, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{68}{164} = \frac{17}{41}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(C)}\; \frac{79}{164}$.
Response 8:
We are given that out of a total of 200 people, 125 people recalled 5 or more dreams and 36 people recalled between 1 to 4 dreams. Therefore, the number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $125+36 = 161$. Out of these 161 people, we know that 68 of them belong to Group Y. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{68}{161} = \frac{8}{19} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$$
Response 9:
Out of the total of 39 in Group X, $39-15=24$ people recalled at least 1 dream. Out of the total of 100 in Group Y, $100-21=79$ people recalled at least 1 dream. Thus, the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $24+79=103$. The probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is: $$\frac{79}{103}$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$.

Firstly, we should plot the two lines $y=-x+a$ and $y=x+b$. Since $y<x+b$ (line 2) is always greater than $y<-x+a$ (line 1) in the first quadrant, the area of interest is in the third quadrant: . 

We see that the lines $y=-x+a$ and $y=x+b$ pass through the point (-a, a) and (b, -b), respectively. Since $(0,0)$ is a solution, we have $a>0$ and $b<0$.

At the point $(0,0)$, the inequality $y<-x+a$ is always satisfied. Therefore, $y>x+b$ must be true. 

Solving $y > x+b$ simultaneously with the line $y=-x+a$, we get
\begin{align*}
-x+a &> x+b \\
\Rightarrow \quad a+b &> 0.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$C=75 h+125$$The equation above gives the amount $C$, in dollars, an electrician charges for a job that takes $h$ hours. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland each hired this electrician. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. How much more did the electrician charge Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 75$
  B: $\$ 125$
  C: $\$ 150$
  D: $\$ 275$
Response 0:
Let's start by finding out the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job when he worked $h$ hours. We can plug in $h$ into the given equation and get:
$$C_R = 75h + 125$$
For Ms. Sanchez's job, we know that the electrician worked 2 hours more. So, the number of hours worked for Ms. Sanchez's job can be expressed as $(h+2)$. Therefore, the amount charged by the electrician for Ms. Sanchez's job can be expressed as:
$$C_S = 75(h+2) + 125 = 75h + 175$$
To find out how much more Ms. Sanchez was charged than Mr. Roland, we need to subtract $C_R$ from $C_S$:
$$C_S - C_R = (75h+175) - (75h+125)= 50$$
Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$50$ more than Mr. Roland.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we'll need to substitute $h+2$ for $h$ in the equation $C = 75h + 125$, since the electrician worked two hours longer at Ms. Sanchez's job than at Mr. Roland's job. 

For Mr. Roland's job, we get: 

$$C = 75h + 125$$
$$C = 75(h) + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 125$$

For Ms. Sanchez's job, we get: 

$$C = 75(h+2) + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 150 + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 275$$

So, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $75h + 275$ dollars, and charged Mr. Roland $75h + 125$ dollars. To find the difference, we need to subtract the amount Mr. Roland was charged from the amount Ms. Sanchez charged: 

$$(75h + 275) - (75h + 125) = 150$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than he charged Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding how many hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland and Ms. Sanchez. Let's assume the electrician worked $x$ hours for Mr. Roland, then he worked $(x+2)$ hours for Ms. Sanchez. 

Using the formula: $C=75h+125$, the cost of the job for Mr. Roland would be:
$$C_1 = 75x+125$$

The cost of the job for Ms. Sanchez would be:
$$C_2 = 75(x+2)+125$$

We need to find the difference between $C_2$ and $C_1$, so let's simplify:

$$C_2-C_1 = 75(x+2)+125-(75x+125) = 75x+150-75x = 150$$

Therefore, the answer is $150$.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's first find the charge for Mr. Roland. Let the number of hours he hired electrician be $h$; hence, he will be charged $C=75h+125$. Now, the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job, so for Ms. Sanchez, the electrician has worked for $h+2$ hours. Then she will be charged $C = 75(h+2) + 125= 75h+150+125=75h+275.$ 

So, Ms. Sanchez paid $\$ 275$ which is $\$ (275-125) =\$ 150$ more expensive than Mr. Roland.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
First, we need to determine the number of hours the electrician spent on each job. Since the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job, let's denote the number of hours worked by Mr. Roland as $h$, then the number of hours worked by Ms. Sanchez is $h + 2$.
We can substitute these expressions into the equation to find the cost of each job. For Mr. Roland's job, the cost is:
$$C = 75h + 125$$
For Ms. Sanchez's job, the cost is:
$$C = 75(h+2) + 125 = 75h + 225$$
The difference in cost between the two jobs is:
$$(75h + 225) - (75h + 125) = 100$$
Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
We are given that the time difference between the two jobs was 2 hours. Without the loss of generality, we can let $h$ be the amount of time the electrician spent on Mr. Roland's job. Therefore, the amount of time spent on Ms. Sanchez's job would be $h+2$. We can then set up two equations to solve for the difference in cost: 

$$\begin{aligned} C_1&=75h+125 \\ C_2&=75(h+2)+125=75h+175\\ C_2-C_1&=(75h+175)-(75h+125)=50 \end{aligned}$$ 

So the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$50$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("None of the above (It's $\$50$ more)")
Response 6:
First, we need to find out how many hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland. Let's say that he worked $h$ hours for Mr. Roland; then he worked $h+2$ hours for Ms. Sanchez. 

We can use the equation $C=75h+125$ to find how much each person was charged:

Mr. Roland was charged $C_1 = 75h+125$ dollars.

Ms. Sanchez was charged $C_2 = 75(h+2)+125=75h+225$ dollars.

The difference in their charges is:

$$\begin{aligned} C_2-C_1 &= (75h+225)-(75h+125) \\ &= 100 \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$ 100$ more than Mr. Roland.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") (The answer is $\$100$, which is not one of the available choices)
Response 7:
Let's start by using $h$ as the number of hours worked by Mr. Roland, and therefore, Ms. Sanchez has worked for $h+2$ hours. Now, we can calculate the amount charged to Mr. Roland by the electrician, which is  $C=75h+125$. To find how much Ms. Sanchez was charged, we plug in $h+2$ into the equation:
$$C_{\text{Sanchez}}=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$$
The difference in the amount charged between Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland is:
$$C_{\text{Sanchez}}-C_{\text{Roland}}=(75h+225)-(75h+125)=100$$
This means the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$ 100$ more than Mr. Roland, therefore the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }\$75}$.
Response 8:
First, we need to find out how many hours the electrician worked for Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland. Let's assume the electrician worked for $x$ hours for Mr. Roland. Then he worked for $x + 2$ hours for Ms. Sanchez. 

Now let's use the equation for the amount charged: 

For Mr. Roland: 
$$C_1 = 75x + 125$$ 

For Ms. Sanchez: 
$$C_2 = 75(x+2) + 125 = 75x + 225$$ 

We want to find the difference between $C_2$ and $C_1$: 

$$C_2 - C_1 = (75x + 225) - (75x + 125) = 100$$ 

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
If the electrician charged $C_s$ for the job for Ms. Sanchez, and $C_r$ for Mr. Roland, we can write two equations:
$$C_s = 75(h + 2) + 125 = 75h + 275$$
and
$$C_r = 75h + 125$$
So the difference in price is:
$$C_s - C_r = (75h + 275) - (75h + 125) = 150$$
Therefore, the answer is **(C) $\$150$**.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
The amount of energy from $p$ grams of protein is $4p$ food calories, the amount from $f$ grams of fat is $9f$ food calories, and the amount from $c$ grams of carbohydrate is $4c$ food calories. We set the sum equal to 180 and solve for $f$: \begin{align*}
4p+9f+4c&=180\text{ food calories} \\
9f&=180-4p-4c \\
f&=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)
\end{align*} Answer: \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}
Response 1:
The energy contributed from the $p$ grams of protein is $4p$ calories. Similarly, the energy contributed from $f$ grams of fat and $c$ grams of carbohydrate are $9f$ and $4c$ calories, respectively. Since the total energy of 180 calories comes from these three macronutrients, we can write:
$$4p+9f+4c=180$$
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
$$9f=180-4p-4c=176-4(p+c)=4(44-(p+c))$$
$$f=\frac{4}{9}(44-(p+c))+20=\frac{4}{9}(20+(p+c))$$
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
We know that the 180 food calories from the granola bar come from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate. Using the table, we can express the total amount of energy in food calories as: $$4p+9f+4c = 180$$
Solving for $f$, we have: $$9f = 180 - 4p - 4c$$ $$f = \frac{180 - 4p - 4c}{9}$$ $$f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)$$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$
Response 3:
Let's use the information given in the question to set up an equation to solve for $f$. Using the fact that every gram of protein contributes 4 food calories, every gram of fat contributes 9 food calories and every gram of carbohydrate contributes 4 food calories, we have:

$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$

Let's solve this equation for $f$:

$4p+9f+4c=180$

$9f=180-4p-4c$

$f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$

$f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 4:
One way to solve the problem is to set up equations using the given information: $4p+9f+4c=180$ (in food calories) and $16.7p+37.7f+16.7c=753.6$ (in kilojoules). Then we can eliminate $c$ by multiplying the first equation by $-4/9$ and adding it to the second equation, which gives us $16.7p+23.8f=317.6$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=20+\frac{4}{9}p+\frac{4}{9}c$. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A") $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
Response 5:
We have that 180 food calories come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate. From the table, we know that protein provides 4 food calories per gram, fat provides 9 food calories per gram, and carbohydrate provides 4 food calories per gram. Then we can write
\[4p+9f+4c=180.\]Solving for $f$, we get
\[9f=180-4p-4c=176-4(p+c)=4(44-(p+c)).\]Hence,
\[f = \frac{4}{9}(44-(p+c)) + 20 = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c).\]So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 6:
Since the problem gives us energy per gram of macronutrients in a granola bar, we can set up the equation as: 

$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$ 

Simplifying the equation, we have:

$4p + 4c = 180 - 9f$ 

$4(p+c) = 180 - 9f$ 

$9f = 20(4-c-p)$ 

$f=\frac{20(4-c-p)}{9}$ 

Thus, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
The energy in 1 gram of a protein, fat, and carbohydrate are 4.0 and 9.0, and 4.0 food calories respectively. Therefore, the number of grams of each macronutrient can be calculated by setting up an equation using the given information, like this $180=4p+9f+4c$. 
 Solving the equation for $f$ yields $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(c-p)$.   
Therefore, Answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }f = 20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 8:
One gram of protein provides 4.0 food calories, one gram of fat provides 9.0 food calories, and one gram of carbohydrate provides 4.0 food calories. Hence $p$, $f$, and $c$ satisfy $$4p+9f+4c=180 \qquad \Rightarrow  \qquad  f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}.$$  Simplifying the expression above, we get: $$f=\frac{180}{9}-\frac{4p}{9}-\frac{4c}{9}=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c).$$ Therefore, the answer is (B): $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 9:
Let the amount of protein $p$ and carbohydrate $c$ each have calories $4p$ and $4c$, respectively. Then, the amount of fat has $180 - 4p - 4c$ calories. Since the amount of energy in fat is $9$ calories per gram, we have $180 - 4p - 4c = 9f$, which implies $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$. Cross multiplying gives us $f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.

Topic: Math
Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: At what price will the quantity of the product supplied to the market equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 90$
  B: $\$ 120$
  C: $\$ 133$
  D: $\$ 155$
Response 0:
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity demanded, we need to solve for $P$ in the equation $$S(P) = D(P).$$ We can substitute the expressions for $S(P)$ and $D(P)$ given in the problem and solve for $P$: $$\begin{aligned} S(P) & = D(P) \\ \frac{1}{2} P+40 & = 220-P \\ \frac{3}{2} P & = 180 \\ P & = 120. \end{aligned}$$ Therefore, the answer is $\$ 120$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
To find the equilibrium price, we need to find the price $P$ where $S(P) = D(P)$. Substituting the given functions, we have: 

$$\frac{1}{2} P+40 = 220 - P$$

Simplifying: 

$$\frac{3}{2}P = 180$$

$$P = \frac{360}{3} = 120$$

Therefore, the equilibrium price is $\$120$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
To find the equilibrium price, we need to find the price $P$ where $S(P) = D(P)$. Substituting the given equations, we get:
$$\frac{1}{2} P+40=220-P$$
Solving for $P$, we get $P=133$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
To find the equilibrium price, we need to find the value of P that makes $S(P)=D(P)$. Substituting the equations we get,
$$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=D(P) \\\Rightarrow &\frac{1}{2} P+40 =220-P \\\Rightarrow & P=133. \end{aligned}.$$
Therefore, the equilibrium price is $\$133$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we need to set $S(P)=D(P)$ and solve for $P$. We have:
$$\begin{aligned} S(P)&=D(P) \\ \frac{1}{2} P+40&=220-P \\ \frac{3}{2} P&=180 \\ P&=120. \end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("B")

We can set $S(P) = D(P)$ and solve for P to find the price at which supply equals demand. We have:

$$\frac{1}{2} P+40 = 220 - P$$

Solving for P:

$$\frac{3}{2} P = 180$$

$$P = \frac{360}{3} = 120$$

Therefore, the price at which the quantity of the product supplied to the market equals the quantity of the product demanded by the market is $\$ 120$, i.e. Answer(B).
Response 8:
To find the market equilibrium we need to find the price $P$ at which $S(P) = D(P).$ Substituting the functions we get, $$\frac{1}{2}P+40 = 220-P.$$Solving for $P$ we get, $$P= 133.$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$ 133}$.
Response 9:
The quantity of the product supplied to the market equals the quantity demanded when $S(P)=D(P)$. Substituting $S(P)$ and $D(P)$ from the context, we get $$ \frac{1}{2} P+40=220-P.$$ Simplifying the equation above, we obtain  $$ \frac{3}{2} P=180 \Rightarrow P=120.$$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\$120}$.

Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$In the equation above, $k$ is a constant. If $x=9$, what is the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 7
  C: 16
  D: 79
Response 0:
To solve the equation, we need to isolate $k$:
$$
\begin{aligned} 
\sqrt{k+2}-x &= 0 \\ 
\sqrt{k+2} &= x \\
k+2 &= x^2 \\
k &= x^2 - 2 \\
k &= 9^2 - 2 \\
k &= 79
\end{aligned}
$$
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
First, we isolate the variable $k$ in the equation: 

\begin{align*}
\sqrt{k+2}-x &= 0 \\
\sqrt{k+2} &= x \\
\sqrt{k+2} &= 9 \\
k+2 &= 81 \\
k &= 79
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
To solve for $k$, we need to isolate $k$ on one side of the equation. We start by adding $x$ to both sides:

$$\sqrt{k+2}=9$$

Next, we square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:

$$k+2=81$$

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

$$k=79$$

So the answer is (D) 79.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
We have: $$\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$$
Solving for k, we get:
$$\sqrt{k+2}=9$$
$$(\sqrt{k+2})^2=9^2$$
$$k+2=81$$
$$k=79$$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
To solve the equation, we add $x$ to both sides of the equation and square both sides of the equation, which gives: $$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0\\ \sqrt{k+2}&=x\\ k+2&=x^2\\ k&=x^2-2 \end{aligned}$$Now we can substitute $x=9$ into the equation above to obtain the value of $k$: $$k=9^2-2=79$$Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")

Action: Answer("C") 

Solving the equation $\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$ for $k$, we have $k=(\sqrt{9})^2-2=7^2-2=49-2=47$.
Response 6:
We can solve the problem by isolating the term $k$.
Adding $x$ to both sides of the equation, we get $$\sqrt{k+2}=9$$Squaring both sides of the equation: 
$$(\sqrt{k+2})^2=9^2$$which gives:
$$k+2=81$$
Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get:
$$k=79$$
Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
To solve the equation, we need to isolate $k$. We start by adding $x$ to both sides to get:
$$\sqrt{k+2}-x+x=x$$
Simplifying the left side gives:
$$\sqrt{k+2}=9$$
Now, we square both sides:
$$(\sqrt{k+2})^2=9^2$$
$$k+2=81$$
Finally, we subtract 2 from both sides to obtain the value of $k$:
$$k=79$$

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("D")
Response 8:
To solve this question, we can isolate $k$ by squaring both sides of the equation $$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0.$$The obtained equation is $k+2=x^2$. Now we substitute $x=9$ to get $k+2=81$, and finally $$k=79.$$

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
Response 0:
We can solve for $t$ by using the formula $a=1,052+1.08 t.$

And we can write an equation for the difference between the speed of the sound wave and 1,000 feet per second:

\begin{align*}
|a-1000|&=|1,052+1.08 t-1,000|\\
&=1.08 t+52-1,000\\
&=1.08 t-948
\end{align*}

We want to minimize $|a-1000|,$ so we want to minimize $1.08 t-948.$ Note that $1.08t$ will be negative for all of the answer choices, so we just need to find the answer choice that makes $1.08t$ closest to $-948.$ 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
We can solve for the air temperature that will give us the closest speed to 1000 ft/s by setting $a$ in the formula equal to 1000, and then solving for $t$. Mathematically, this means solving the equation:

$$ 1000=1,052+1.08t $$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$$ 1.08t=-52 $$

$$ t=-\frac{52}{1.08}\approx -48.15 $$


Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let $a=1,000$ and solve for $t$ to find which temperature will yield a speed closest to 1,000 feet per second.

$$\begin{aligned} a &=1,052+1.08 t \\ 1,000 &=1,052+1.08 t \\ -52 &=1.08 t \\ t &\approx-48.15 \end{aligned}$$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
First, we need to set up an equation to solve for $t$ at which the speed of sound wave is closest to 1,000 feet per second. 

Given that
$$a=1,052+1.08t$$ 

We can set up the following equation to solve for $t$:

$$1,052+1.08t=1,000$$ 

Subtracting 1,052 from both sides, we get:

$$1.08 t=-52$$ 

Dividing both sides by 1.08, we obtain:

$$t \approx -48.15$$ 

Therefore, the answer is closest to:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can start by substituting $a=1000$ into the formula and solve for $t$:
\begin{aligned} 1000&=1,052+1.08 t \\ 1.08 t&=1000-1,052=-52 \\ t&=\frac{-52}{1.08}\approx -48.148 \end{aligned}
We see that $t$ is closest to $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Therefore, the answer is (B).

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To solve this problem, we need to find the temperature $t$ that makes the value of $a$ closest to 1,000. We can start by plugging in each of the answer choices into the formula and calculating the corresponding value of $a$. Then we can compare these values to see which one is closest to 1,000.

Action: A=1052+1.08*(-46)

Action: B=1052+1.08*(-48)

Action: C=1052+1.08*(-49)

Action: D=1052+1.08*(-50)

Based on these calculations, we can see that:

$A \approx 977$

$B \approx 970$

$C \approx 967$

$D \approx 963$

Therefore, the answer is (A) $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, since it gives a value of $a$ that is closest to 1,000.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$2 a x-15=3(x+5)+5(x-1)$$In the equation above, $a$ is a constant. If no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, what is the value of $a$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 4
  D: 8
Response 0:
First, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation by combining like terms: 

$$2ax - 15 = 3x + 15 - 5 + 5x$$
$$2ax - 15 = 7x + 10$$
$$2ax = 7x + 25$$
$$x=\frac{7}{2a}+\frac{25}{2a}.$$

Since we are told that no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, that means the expression on the right-hand side (which simplifies to $7x + 25$) can never equal the expression on the left-hand side (which is $2ax - 15$). In other words, the coefficient of $x$ on the right-hand side (which is 7) must be different from the coefficient of $x$ on the left-hand side (which is $2a$).

So we solve the equation $2a \neq 7$:

$$ 2a \neq 7 $$
$$ a \neq \frac{7}{2} $$

Therefore, the value of $a$ that would make no value of $x$ satisfy the equation is $a=\frac{7}{2}$.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
First, we simplify both sides of the equation:
\begin{align*}
2ax-15 &= 3(x+5)+5(x-1) \\
2ax-15 &= 3x+15+5x-5 \\
2ax-15 &= 8x+10
\end{align*}

We can manipulate this equation to get $x$ by itself:

\begin{align*}
2ax &= 8x+25 \\
x(2a-8) &= 25 \\
x &= \frac{25}{2a-8}
\end{align*}

Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, it follows that the denominator of $x$ must be equal to 0. Therefore, we must have $2a-8 = 0$, which gives us $a=4$. 

Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")     
    
Expanding the brackets, the equation can be written as 
$$(2a-8)x-40=0$$
No value of $x$ will satisfy this equation unless $$(2a-8)=0$$
So, $$2a=8\implies a=4$$
Therefore, the answer is (B) 2.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we have:
$$2ax-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
Simplifying both sides we get:
$$2ax=3x+5x+15-5+15$$
$$2ax=8x+25$$
$$2ax-8x=25$$
$$x(2a-8)=25$$
$$2a-8=\frac{25}{x}$$

Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, we know that the right-hand side of the equation must never be equal to zero. Hence, for all values of $x$, $\frac{25}{x}$ must not equal zero, which implies $x \neq 0$. 
Then we can divide both sides by $2$ and solve for $a$:
$$a-4=\frac{25}{2x}$$
$$a=\frac{25}{2x}+4$$

Since the right-hand side of this equation is a sum of a constant and a term that depends on $x$, it can never be equal to a constant value for all $x$. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no value for $a$ that satisfies the given equation for any value of $x$. 
The correct answer is: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")  

The equation can be simplified to $$(2a-8)x=43$$
Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, then we must have $2a-8\neq 0$,
thus $a\neq 4$.
Now any value of $a$ other than $4$ makes the left-hand side non-zero, so that $x=\frac{43}{2(a-4)}$ satisfies the equation. Therefore,
the only possible value of $a$ is $a=4$. But this value results in the left-hand side being zero, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, there is no value of $a$ that satisfies the conditions.
Hence, the answer is 2.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")  

Note that the left-hand side is linear in x, whereas the right-hand side is quadratic in x. 
Thus, the equation has no solution unless the coefficients are such that the terms in x on both sides cancel each other out. 
Setting the coefficients of $x$ on both sides equal to each other gives $2a=3+5$, or $a=4$.
Response 9:
First, we simplify both sides of the equation and get the equivalent expression: $$2ax-15=8x+10$$
Then, we collect the terms with $x$ on one side and non-$x$ terms on the other side: $$2ax-8x=25$$
We can factor out $2x$ from the left side: $$(2a-8)x=25$$
If no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, then $(2a-8)\neq 0$, which means $$2a-8\neq 0$$
We can solve for $a$ and get: $$a\neq 4$$

Therefore, the answer is: 
Action: Answer("C") $a=4$ is not the correct answer, so the value of $a$ must be $4$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The function $f$ is defined by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$. The graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following intervals contains the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-4<x<-3$
  B: $-3<x<1$
  C: $1<x<3$
  D: $3<x<4$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Explanation:

We can expand the given equation for the function $f$ as:
$$f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3.$$
We can see that the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, which means that the parabola opens upwards. 
The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of this parabola is given by the formula $x=-\dfrac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$ and $b$ is the coefficient of $x$. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$, so
$$x=-\dfrac{4}{2(1)}=-2.$$ 
Therefore, the correct answer is -2. The interval that contains $-2$ is the interval $-3<x<1$, which is choice $\textbf{(B)}$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of a quadratic function defined by $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$,
we can use the formula $x=- \frac{b}{2 a}$. In this problem, 
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= (x+3)(x+1) \\
&= x^{2} + 4 x + 3 \\
&= (x^{2} + 4 x + 4) - 1 \\
&= (x+2)^{2} -1
\end{align*}
Therefore, the vertex of the graph of $y=f(x)$ is $(-2,-1)$. 
The interval that contains $-2$ is $-3 < x < 1$, which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("-2")  

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, we use the formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, we have $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Since $-4<-2<-3$, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is in the interval $-4<x<-3$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("-2") 

Solution:
The vertex of a parabola given in the form of $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ is at $x=\frac{-b}{2a}$.
In this case, we can expand the given function to get $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$, so the vertex is at $x=\frac{-4}{2(1)}=-2$.
Thus, the answer is in the interval $-3<x<1$, which is our choice $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("-1") 

Explanation: 
The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$:
\begin{align*}
-\frac{b}{2a} &= -\frac{2}{2}= -1
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ -3<x<1}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Explanation: 
Using the factored form of $f$, we can expand as follows:  

$$f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$$ 

We can then use the formula $\frac{-b}{2a}$ to find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the corresponding parabola, since the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$. 

In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$, giving us: 

$$x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$$ 

So the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$. Since $-4$ and $3$ are outside the range of $x$-values where $f$ takes on its maximum or minimum value, we can eliminate choices A and D. Similarly, $1$ is not an $x$-value where the maximum or minimum occurs, so we can eliminate choice C. This leaves us with choice B, which is the only interval that contains $-2$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("-2.0 or -2") 

Solution: The vertex of the parabola is at $x=\dfrac{-(b)}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic function. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$. So,  $x=\dfrac{-4}{2(1)}=-2$.  Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$, which is in the interval $-4<x<-3$.

Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } -4<x<-3}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("-2")  

Explanation: 

We can write $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$. To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, we can use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a=1$ and $b=4$. Plugging these values in the formula, we get $x=-\frac{4}{2}=-2$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$, which is in the interval $-4<x<-3$. So the answer is (A).
Response 8:
Action: Answer("-2")  

The vertex of the parabola given by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ is located at $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2}= -2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("-1") 

One way to find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola is by using the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where the quadratic function is $y = ax^2+bx+c$. Using this formula with $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$, we get $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{1+3}{2}= -2$. Therefore, the vertex of $f$ has an $x$-coordinate of $-2$. This is contained in the interval $-4<x<-1$, which corresponds to answer choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -4<x<-3}$.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")  

Solution:

$$ \begin{aligned} \frac{2}{3}(9 x-6)-4 &=9 x-6 \\ (6x - 4) - 4 &= 9x - 6 \\ 6x - 8 &= 9x - 6 \\ -8 + 6 &= 9x - 6x \\ -2 &= 3x \\ \frac{-2}{3} &= x \\ \end{aligned} $$

Substitute the value of $x$ in $3x - 2$ :

$$ 3\left(\frac{-2}{3} \right) -2 = -6/3 -2 = -2 -2 = -4 $$

Hence, the answer is 4 (option D).

Solution:
\begin{aligned} \frac{2}{3}(9 x-6)-4&=9 x-6 \quad &&\text{Distribute }\frac{2}{3} \text{ over }9x \text{ and over } -6 \\ 6x-4-4&=9x-6 \quad &&\text{Simplify} \\ 6x-8&=9x-6 \quad &&\text{Combine like terms} \\ -3x&=2 \quad &&\text{Isolate }x\text{ term} \\ x&=-\frac{2}{3}\quad &&\\ 3x-2&=3\Bigg(-\frac{2}{3}\Bigg)-2 \quad &&\text{Substitute the value for }x \\ &= \boxed{4} \quad &&\end{aligned}
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")  
Solution: 

Simplifying and solving for $x$, we have: 
\begin{aligned} \frac{2}{3}(9 x-6)-4&=9 x-6 \\ 6 x-4-4&=9 x-6 \\ 6x-8&=9x-6 \\ -2&=3x \\ -\frac{2}{3}&=x \\ \end{aligned}

Therefore, 
\begin{aligned} 3x-2 &= 3\Big(-\frac{2}{3}\Big)-2 \\ &= -2-2\\ &= -4. \end{aligned} 

Hence, the answer is (D) 4.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")  

Solution:
$$
\begin{aligned} \frac{2}{3}(9 x-6)-4 &=\frac{2}{3} \cdot 9 x-\frac{2}{3} \cdot 6-4 \\ &=6 x-4-4 \\ &=6 x-8 \\ &=9 x-6 \\ 3 x-2 &=3(2 x-\frac{2}{3}) \\ &=6 x-2 \end{aligned}
$$
Substitute $9 x-6$ in the equation, we have

$$
\begin{aligned} 6 x-8 &=9 x-6 \\ -3 x &=2 \\ x &=-\frac{2}{3} \end{aligned}
$$
Therefore, $3 x-2=3(-\frac{2}{3})-2= -4.$

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100
Response 0:
We can solve for $x$ by plugging in $y = 100$ since the question tells us that Clayton used 100 milliliters of the $20$% saline solution, and then solve for $x$.
\begin{align*} 0.10 x+0.20 \cdot 100 &= 0.18(x+100)\\ 0.10 x+20 &= 0.18 x+18\\ 0.08 x &= 2\\ x &= \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 25}. \end{align*}
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
First, substitute $100$ for $y$ in the equation provided and solve for $x$.

$$0.10 x+0.20 \cdot 100 =0.18(x+100)$$
$$0.10 x+20 = 0.18 x+18$$
$$0.02 x =2$$
$$x=100$$

Thus, Clayton must mix $100$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution. 

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 3:
We know that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ saline solution. We can set up an equation based on the given information and solve for $x$:

$$0.10x + 0.20(100) = 0.18(x + 100)$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$0.10x + 20 = 0.18x + 18$$

$$0.08x = 2$$

$$x = 25$$

Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 25}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ saline solution.
Response 4:
We know that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the 20% by mass saline solution, so that means the equation becomes $$0.10x+0.20(100)=0.18(x+100).$$Simplifying it, we get $$0.10x+20=0.18x+18.$$Simplifying it again, we have $$0.08x=2\Rightarrow x=25.$$Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 25}$ milliliters of the 10% by mass saline solution.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Multiplying both sides of the given equation by $100$ changes the decimals to percentages, we get:$$10x+20y=18(x+y)$$$$10x+20y=18x+18y$$$$2y=8x$$$$y=4x$$If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, then he should use $4(100)=400$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")  
We can start solving the equation by distributing $0.18$ to get: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18x+0.18 y.$$By isolating the terms that have $x$ we arrive at: $$0.02x=0.02y,$$or \begin{align*}
x&=y.
\end{align*}Since Clayton uses $100$ milliliters of solution that has $20 \%$ mass by saline content, he must use $y=100$ milliliters of solution that has $10 \%$ mass by saline content. Thus, we only need to find $x=y=100.$ Plugging into one of the original equation, we see that this is indeed a valid solution. Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 50}$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
Response 8:
We can solve the equation using basic algebra.  
First we simplify both sides by multiplying all the terms by 100:
$$10x+20y=18(x+y) \implies 10x+20y=18x+18y$$
Simplifying further, we get:
$$2x=2y \implies x=y$$
We know that Clayton uses a total of 100 milliliters of $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, so he will use $y=100$ milliliters of the $20 \%$ solution. Using our equation $x=y$, we have $x=100$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ solution.  

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 100 to eliminate the decimals, we have:
$$10x+20y=18(x+y)$$
Expanding the right hand side, we get:
$$10x+20y=18x+18y$$
Simplifying, we have:
$$2x=2y$$
Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 
$$x=y$$
Since Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ saline solution, he must use an equal amount of the $10 \%$ saline solution to maintain the ratio. Therefore he needs $\frac{100}{2} = 50$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ saline solution.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Which of the following is equivalent to $2\left(x^{2}-x\right)+3\left(x^{2}-x\right) ?$
Choices:
  A: $5 x^{2}-5 x$
  B: $5 x^{2}+5 x$
  C: $5 x$
  D: $5 x^{2}$
Response 0:
We can start by combining like terms: 

$2\left(x^{2}-x\right)+3\left(x^{2}-x\right) = (2+3)(x^{2}-x) = 5(x^2-x)$ 

So the answer is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
First, we can combine the like terms inside each parenthesis.  $2\left(x^{2}-x\right)+3\left(x^{2}-x\right) = (2+3)x^2 - (2+3)x$.  Combining like terms again, we have $5x^2 - 5x.$

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
First, we could combine the like terms as follows: 

$2\left(x^{2}-x\right)+3\left(x^{2}-x\right)$
$=2 \cdot x^{2} - 2 \cdot x + 3 \cdot x^{2} - 3 \cdot x$
$=5 \cdot x^{2} - 5 \cdot x$

Therefore, the correct answer is 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
We can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition as follows:
\begin{aligned} 2\left(x^{2}-x\right)+3\left(x^{2}-x\right) &=2 \cdot x^{2}-2 \cdot x+3 \cdot x^{2}-3 \cdot x \\ &= 2x^2 + 3x^2 - 2x - 3x \\ &= 5x^2 - 5x. \end{aligned}
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }5 x^{2}-5 x}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Expanding the given expression, we have:

$2\left(x^{2}-x\right)+3\left(x^{2}-x\right) = 2x^{2}-2x+3x^{2}-3x = 5x^{2}-5x$

Question: Lani spent $15 \%$ of her 8-hour workday in meetings. How many minutes of her workday did she spend in meetings?
Choices:
  A: 1.2
  B: 15
  C: 48
  D: 72
Response 0:
To answer the question, we need to find 15% of 8 hours which is: 

$0.15 \times 8$ hours $ = 1.2 $ hours

Then, we can convert 1.2 hours to minutes by multiplying with 60:

$1.2 \times 60$ minutes $ = 72$ minutes

Therefore, Action: Answer("D") is the correct answer.
Response 1:
To solve the problem, we need to find $15\%$ of 8 hours, which can be computed as follows:

$15 \% \text{ of } 8 \text{ hours} = 0.15 \cdot 8 \text{ hours} =1.2 \text{ hours}$

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:

$1.2 \text{ hours} \cdot 60\frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}}= 72 \text{ minutes}$

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 2:
To find out how many minutes Lani spent in meetings, we need to convert the percentage of time spent in meetings to hours and then to minutes.

Action: Answer("72")

Explanation: Lani spent $15 \%$ of her 8-hour workday in meetings; therefore, the total time she spent in meetings is $15 \% \cdot 8~\text{hours} = 1.2~\text{hours}$. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Lani spent $1.2~\text{hours}\cdot 60~\frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}}=72~\text{minutes}$ in meetings. Therefore, the answer is D: 72.
Response 3:
To find the answer, we first need to find how many minutes are in 8 hours. 

$8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}} = 480$ minutes

$Lani$ spent $15 \%$ of 480 minutes in meetings

$15 \% \times 480 = 0.15 \times 480 = 72$

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let's start by converting 8 hours to minutes.  
$$ 8 \text{ hours} \cdot 60 \frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}} = 480 \text{ minutes} $$ 

Now we can simply compute 15 percent of 480:  
$$  0.15 \cdot 480 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes} $$ 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
To solve the problem, first we need to convert 8-hour to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
$$8 \text{ hours} \cdot 60 \frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}} = 480 \text{ minutes}$$
Then, we can find the minutes Lani spent in meetings by calculating $15 \%$ of 480:
$$15 \% \cdot 480 \text{ minutes} = \frac{15}{100} \cdot 480 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}$$
Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To solve this problem, we need to convert 8 hours to minutes, then multiply by $15 \% $

$8\ hours\ \times\ 60 = 480\ minutes$

$15 \% \ of\ 480\ =\ 0.15\ \times\ 480\ =\ 72$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
To convert a percentage to a decimal, you divide by 100. So, we have:
$15 \% \cdot 8 \text{ hours} = (15/100) \cdot 8 \text{ hours} = 1.2 \text{ hours}$
To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60. So, we have:
$1.2 \text{ hours} \cdot 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 72$ 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Lani spent $15 \% = \frac{15}{100} = \frac{3}{20}$ of her 8-hour workday in meetings. Therefore, she spent $\frac{3}{20}\times 8 \; \text{hours} = \frac{3}{20}\times 8 \times 60 \; \text{minutes}= 36$ minutes of her workday in meetings.

The results are summarized in the table above. If one of the surgeons is selected at random, which of the following is closest to the probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research?
Choices:
  A: 0.122
  B: 0.196
  C: 0.318
  D: 0.379
Response 0:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is:

$$P = \frac{\text{Number of research-oriented orthopedic surgeons}}{\text{Total number of surveyed surgeons}} = \frac{74}{607} \approx 0.122$$

The closest value to this probability is (A) 0.122.

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
The probability we are looking for is the ratio of orthopedic surgeons who indicated their major professional activity as research to the total number of surgeons surveyed. This is equal to $\dfrac{74}{607}$ which simplifies to $0.122$ (approximately).

Therefore, 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
The probability of selecting an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is $\dfrac{74}{607} \approx 0.122$, which is closest to choice $\textbf{(A)}\ 0.122$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is given by:

$$ P(\text{Orthopedic and Research}) = \frac{74}{607} \approx 0.122 $$

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is approximately:

$$\frac{\text{Number of orthopedic surgeons conducting research}}{\text{Total number of surgeons}}=\frac{74}{607}\approx\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0.122}$$
Response 5:
The probability of selecting an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research would be:
\begin{align*}
 &= \frac{\text{Number of Orthopedic Surgeons Doing Research}}{\text{Total Number of Surgeons}}\\
 &= \frac{74}{607}\\
 &\approx 0.122\\
\end{align*}
So the closest answer choice to the probability above would be (A) 0.122. 

Therefore, Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{Number of orthopedic surgeons conducting research}}{\text{Total number of surgeons}} &= \frac{74}{607} \\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0.122}
\end{align*}
Response 7:
The probability of selecting an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is given by:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{Number of Orthopedic Surgeons whose indicated professional activity is research}}{Total \, Number \, of \, Surgeons} &= \frac{74}{607} \\

The closest answer choice to 0.125 is A: 0.122. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
There are 230 orthopedic surgeons who indicated their major professional activity, and 74 of them indicated research as their major professional activity. Therefore, the probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research can be calculated as 74/607 ≈ 0.122. 
So, the closest option is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is equal to:

$P(\text{Orthopedic surgeon and research activity}) = \dfrac{74}{607}$

To approximate this probability, we can round 607 to 600 and 74 to 80. Then, the approximation is $\dfrac{80}{600} = \dfrac{4}{30} \approx 0.133 \approx \boxed{\textbf{(A) }0.122}$.

Topic: Math
Question: If $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ for all values of $x$, and $a+b=8$, what are the two possible values for $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: 3 and 5
  B: 6 and 35
  C: 10 and 21
  D: 31 and 41
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
We can begin by expanding the left-hand side, which will give us:
$$abx^{2}+(7a+2b)x+14=15x^{2}+cx+14$$
Now we can equate the coefficients of $x^{2}$, $x$, and the constant term, to get the following system of equations:
\begin{align*}
ab &= 15 \\
7a + 2b &= c \\
14 &= 14
\end{align*}
We can solve for $a$ and $b$ by substituting $b=8-a$ into the first equation, giving us $a(8-a)=15$, which can be simplified to $a^{2}-8a+15=(a-5)(a-3)=0$. So $a=5$ or $a=3$, which gives us $b=3$ or $b=5$ respectively. Now we can substitute these values of $a$ and $b$ into the second equation to get $c=7a+2b=37$ or $c=7a+2b=17$ respectively. Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 17 and 37, which is option:

Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Solution: We can first distribute the left-hand side of the equation to get \begin{align*}
(ab)x^2+(7a+2b)x+14 &= 15x^2 + cx + 14 \\
\Rightarrow \qquad (ab - 15)x^2 + (7a + 2b - c)x &= 0.
\end{align*} For this to hold for all values of $x$, both terms inside the parentheses must equal zero. Since we cannot have $ab = 15$ (otherwise the polynomial would be higher degree), we know that $7a+2b = c$. We also know that $a+b = 8$, so $b = 8-a$. Substituting this into the equation for $c$, we have $c = 7a + 2(8-a) = 6a+16$. Thus, the possible values of $c$ are the values that can be obtained by plugging in integer values from $0$ to $6$ for $a$. This gives us $c = 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46$. The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 3 \text{ and } 5}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Solution:

First, we expand the left-hand side of the equation:
$$
(a x+2)(b x+7)=a b x^{2}+(7 a+2 b) x+14
$$
So $a b=15$ and $7 a+2 b=c$.

We know that $a+b=8$, so $b=8-a$, which we can substitute into the equation $a b=15$ to get:
\begin{align*}
a(8-a) &= 15 \\
8a-a^2 &= 15 \\
a^2 - 8a + 15 &= 0\\
(a-3)(a-5)&=0\\
a&=3,5
\end{align*}

Now, we can substitute these values into $7a+2b=c$ to get the possible values of $c$:
\begin{align*}
a=3, b=5: & \quad 7(3)+2(5)=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }10} \\
a=5, b=3: & \quad 7(5)+2(3)=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }21}

Question: If $20-x=15$, what is the value of $3 x ?$
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 10
  C: 15
  D: 35
Response 0:
First, we can solve $20-x=15$ as follows: 

$20-x=15$

$-x=15-20$

$-x=-5$

$x=5$

Therefore, $3x=3(5)=15$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")  

$20-x=15 \Rightarrow $
$-x+20=15 \Rightarrow $
$x=5  $

So, $3x=3*5=15$
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D") 

If we solve the equation $20-x = 15$, we get $x=5$. 
We can then substitute $x=5$ into $3x$ to get $3(5) = 15$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D") 

Solution:
$20-x=15$

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

$5-x=0$

Adding x to both sides, we get:

$5=x$

So, 

$ 3x=3\times5=15 $ 

Therefore, the answer is (D) 15.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D") 

Explanation:
Given $20 - x = 15$
Adding x on both sides, 
$20 - x + x = 15 + x$
$20 = 15 + x$
Subtracting 15 on both sides, 
$20 - 15 = 15 - 15 + x$
$5 = x$
Therefore, $3x = 3\times 5 = 15$
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 

$20-x=15$

$20-15=x$

$5=x$

Hence,  $3x=3 \times 5 = 15$, which corresponds to choice C.
Response 6:
Solution: $20-x=15$

$x= 20-15$

$x= 5$

$3x = 3(5) = 15$

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Solution:
\begin{aligned} 20-x&=15 \\ 20-15&=x \\ x&=5 \\ 3x&=3\times5 \\ &=15 \end{aligned}
Therefore, the answer is "C: 15". 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Solution:
Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get:
$$20 - x -20 = 15 -20$$
$$-x = -5$$
Dividing by -1:
$$x=5$$

Multiplying both sides by 3:
$$3x = 3 \times 5 = 15$$

The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the slope-intercept form $r(p)=mp+b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.

We notice that if we increase the purchase price of a property by 1,000 dollars then the corresponding rent increases by a certain amount. This shows us that there is a linear relationship between the rental price and the purchase price.

To get the slope, we can choose any two pairs $(p_1,r_1)$ and $(p_2,r_2)$ from the data and use the slope formula:

$$m=\frac{r_2-r_1}{p_2-p_1}$$

Let's use the pairs $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$:

$$m=\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=\frac{360}{48}=7.5$$

So the slope is 7.5. 

To get the y-intercept, we can use one of the points and solve for $b$. 
Using $(128,950)$,
$$950=7.5(128)+b$$
$$b=-10$$

Therefore, the function is:

$$r(p)=7.5 p-10$$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To find the answer, we need to figure out the slope and the y-intercept of the line which relates the monthly rental price ($r$) and the purchase price ($p$). Using two points from the given table, say $(128,950)$ and $(176,1310)$, we have 

slope $m=\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=6$ 

To calculate the $y$-intercept $b$, we can use either of the above two points. Using the first point $(128,950)$, we have 

$950=6\cdot 128+b \Rightarrow b=440$

Therefore, the equation of the line is $r(p)=6p+440$. So the answer is (C). 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
We can use the two given data points to form two equations and solve for the slope $m$ and $y$-intercept $b$ of the linear function $r(p)$. For example, using the Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive properties, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned} r(128)&=950 \\ r(176)&=1310 \end{aligned}
$$

Using the point-slope formula, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
m &= \frac{1310-950}{176-128}=\frac{360}{48}=7.5 \\
b &= 950-m(128) = -10
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$ and the property's purchase price $p$ is given by:

$$
r(p)=7.5p-10
$$

Hence, the answer is $\textbf{(D)}$
Response 3:
First, we need to determine the slope of the linear function, which represents the rate of change between the monthly rental price and the purchase price. The slope can be calculated as follows:

slope $= \frac{\text{change in rental price}}{\text{change in purchase price}}$

The change in the rental price for any two points can be calculated by subtracting the rental prices. Similarly, the change in the purchase price for any two points can be calculated by subtracting the purchase prices. Let's use the points $(128,950)$ and $(176,1310)$:

slope $= \frac{1310-950}{176000-128000} = \frac{360}{48000} = 0.0075$

Therefore, the slope of the linear function is $0.0075$, and the $y$-intercept (the rental price when the purchase price is $0$) is $0$. 

Using the slope-intercept form of a linear function, the answer that represents the relationship between monthly rental price $r$ and property's purchase price $p$ is:

$r(p)=0.0075 p$ 

However, the question asks for the function in terms of thousands of dollars, so we can simplify this to:

$r(p)=7.5 p$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ r(p)=7.5 p-10}$
Response 4:
The slope-intercept form of a linear function is $y= mx+b$, where $m$ represents the slope of the line and $b$ represents the y-intercept. In this case, we want to represent the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars. So, we need to convert the purchase price to thousands of dollars and find the slope and y-intercept of the equation.

To convert the purchase price to thousands of dollars, we need to divide each price by 1000. Then, we can use two points from the table to find the slope:

$(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$

The slope is:

$m=\dfrac{1310-950}{176-128}=\dfrac{360}{48}=7.5$

To find the y-intercept, we can use one point and the slope:

$(128, 950)$

$950=7.5(0.128)+b$

$b=10$

So, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars is:

$r(p)=7.5p+10$

To match the form of the choices, we can write it as:

$r(p)=7.5p-(-10)$

So, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
We can solve this problem using two data points. Let's use the first and second properties.
- Clearwater Lane: $p=128$ (thousand dollars), $r=950$ (dollars).
- Driftwood Drive: $p=176$ (thousand dollars), $r=1,310$ (dollars).
The slope of the line passing through these two points is
$$m=\frac{\text{change in } r}{\text{change in } p}=\frac{1,310-950}{176-128}=6.4$$
Using the slope-intercept form of a linear function, we can write the function as $r(p)=mp+b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. We can use one of the data points to find $b$. Let's use the first one:
\begin{align*}
950&=6.4\times 128+b \\
b&=950-6.4\times 128 \\
&=-736. \\
\end{align*}
Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is:
$$r(p)=6.4p-736.$$
To match the choices given, we can rewrite this function as $r(p)=6.4p+440$, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}}$.
Response 6:
The slope of the line indicates the increase in $r(p)$ as $p$ increases.
Pick two points from the table to calculate the slope of the line:
- Clearwater Lane: $(128,000,950)$
- Driftwood Drive: $(176,000,1,310)$

Slope $= \frac{r_2-r_1}{p_2-p_1}=\frac{1,310-950}{176-128}=5$

The $y$-intercept is the value of $r(p)$ when $p=0$, which is not applicable in this context since the purchase price cannot be $0$. 

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$ is $r(p) = 5p+b$ where $b$ is the $y$-intercept.

Substitute the value of $r(p)$ and $p$ from any of the points above and solve for $b$:

$950 = 5(128) + b$

$b = -490$

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship is $r(p) = 5p - 490$.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 7:
The slope of the line which represents the relationship between rental price and purchase price should equal the ratio between the change in rental price and change in purchase price between any two points in the chart.
\begin{aligned} \textbf{Slope }&=\frac{r_2 - r_1}{p_2 - p_1} \\ & = \frac{1310 - 515}{176 - 70} \\ &= 5 \end{aligned}
Therefore, the equation of the line between rental price and purchase price is $r(p) = 5p + b$. We can solve for $b$ by plugging in one of the points.
\begin{aligned} 950 &= 5(128) + b \\ 950 &= 640 + b \\ 310 &= b \end{aligned}
Therefore, the equation is $r(p) = 5p + 310$, or Answer is $\textbf{(B)}$.
Response 8:
We need to find a linear function of the form $r(p)=mp+b$, where $r$ is the monthly rental price in dollars, and $p$ is the purchase price in thousands of dollars. To find the slope $m$ and $y$-intercept $b$, we need to use the information provided about two points. Let's use the points $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$, corresponding to the properties at Clearwater Lane and Hamilton Circle, respectively. The slope is given by $$m=\frac{\text{change in }r}{\text{change in }p}=\frac{3365-950}{450-128}=5.$$ To find the $y$-intercept $b$, we can use either data point. Using $(128,950)$, we have $$950=5\cdot 128+b,$$ which gives $b=-870$. Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$ and the property's purchase price $p$ is $r(p)=5p-870$, or $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }r(p)=2.5p-870}$.
Response 9:
To find the linear equation that represents the data, we need to find the slope $m$ and the intercept $b$.

We can find the slope using two of the points: $(128,950)$ and $(450,3365)$.
The slope $m$ is given by: $m=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}=\frac{\Delta r}{\Delta p}=\frac{3365-950}{450-128}=\frac{2415}{322}\approx7.5$

To find the intercept $b$, we can use any of the points. Let's use $(128,950)$:
$r=p\cdot m+b\Rightarrow b=r-p\cdot m=950-128\cdot 7.5=-10$

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is: $r(p)=7.5p-10$, which corresponds to choice $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$.

Question: To make a bakery's signature chocolate muffins, a baker needs 2.5 ounces of chocolate for each muffin. How many pounds of chocolate are needed to make 48 signature chocolate muffins?( 1 pound $=16$ ounces)
Choices:
  A: 7.5
  B: 10
  C: 50.5
  D: 120
Response 0:
To make 1 muffin requires 2.5 ounces of chocolate. So, to make 48 muffins we need (48 x 2.5) = 120 ounces of chocolate.
To convert ounces to pounds we need to divide the result by 16.
Therefore, the amount of chocolate needed in pounds is 120 ÷ 16 = 7.5
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
First, we need to find the total amount of chocolate (in ounces) needed to make 48 muffins. 

The baker needs 2.5 ounces of chocolate for each muffin, so for 48 muffins, they will need:

2.5 ounces/muffin x 48 muffins = 120 ounces

Now we need to convert ounces to pounds, using the conversion 1 pound = 16 ounces:

120 ounces ÷ 16 ounces/pound = 7.5 pounds

Therefore, the answer is A: 7.5. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
First we need to find out how many ounces are needed to make 48 muffins. To do this, we multiply the number of ounces needed for one muffin by the number of muffins we want to make.
$2.5$ ounces per muffin $\times 48$ muffins $= 120$ ounces
Next we convert 120 ounces to pounds by dividing by 16 (since 1 pound is 16 ounces):
$120$ ounces $= \frac{120}{16}$ pounds $=7.5$ pounds
Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
To determine the amount of chocolate in pounds we need to convert all measurements given to pounds and then multiply the number of muffins by the number of pounds of chocolate used per muffin. We have:

$48$ muffins $\times \frac{2.5 \text{ ounces}}{1\text{ muffin}} \times \frac{1\text{ pound}}{16 \text{ ounces}}= 3$ pounds

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
To make 1 muffin, the baker needs 2.5 ounces of chocolate. To make 48 muffins, the baker needs: 

$$ 2.5\text{ ounces/muffin} \times 48 \text{ muffins} = 120\text{ ounces} $$

To convert this to pounds, we need to divide by 16:

$$  120\text{ ounces} ÷16\text{ ounces/pound} = 7.5\text{ pounds} $$

Therefore, Answer("A") is correct. The bakery needs 7.5 pounds of chocolate to make 48 muffins.
Response 5:
First, we need to find out how many total ounces we need to make 48 muffins. 
2.5 ounces needed for each muffin, so: 

$2.5 \text{ ounces/muffin} \times 48 \text{ muffins} = 120 \text{ ounces}$ 

Next, we need to convert to pounds: 

$120 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/pound} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}$ 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
To make one muffin, 2.5 ounces of chocolate is needed. So, to make 48 muffins, the total amount of chocolate needed is:
$$ 2.5 \text{ ounces/muffin} \times 48 \text{ muffins} = 120 \text{ ounces} $$ 

To convert ounces to pounds, we can divide by 16:
$$ 120 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/pound } = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }10} \text{ pounds}$$

Answer: Answer("B")

Distance walked in 1 second = 25 meters / 13.7 seconds 

Distance walked in 1 second = 1.82 meters/second 

Then, we will compute how many meters Nate will walk in 4 minutes (which is 240 seconds). 

Distance walked in 240 seconds = 1.82 meters/second * 240 seconds 

Distance walked in 240 seconds = 436.8 meters 

Action: Answer("A") 
Response 1:
To solve the problem, we first need to find the distance Nate walks in one second:

distance/seconds = 25m/13.7s ≈ 1.82 m/s

Then we can multiply the distance by the number of seconds in 4 minutes (i.e., 240 seconds) to find the total distance Nate walks in 4 minutes:

distance = 1.82 m/s x 240 s = 436.8 ≈ 437 meters

Therefore, the closest answer is Answer("B"): 450 meters.
Response 2:
To solve this problem, we first need to calculate Nate's rate:
rate = distance / time
rate = 25 meters / 13.7 seconds
rate ≈ 1.8248 meters per second

Now we can calculate the distance he will walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds):
distance = rate × time
distance = 1.8248 meters per second × 240 seconds
distance ≈ 438 meters

Therefore, the answer is closest to choice B: 450 meters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
To calculate this, we can first find Nate's speed: 

Speed = Distance / Time 

Speed = 25 meters / 13.7 seconds 

Speed (rounded to the nearest tenth) = 1.8 meters per second 

To find how far Nate can walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds), we can use the same formula: 

Distance = Speed x Time 

Distance = 1.8 meters per second x 240 seconds 

Distance = 432 meters 

Therefore, the closest option to the distance Nate can walk in 4 minutes is option B, 450 meters. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To solve the problem, we first need to find out how far Nate can walk in 1 second. We can do this by dividing the distance he covered by the time he took: 

25 meters ÷ 13.7 seconds = 1.825 meters/second

Next, we can use this value to find out how far he will walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds):

1.825 meters/second x 240 seconds = 438 meters (approximately)

Therefore, the closest answer choice is B: 450 meters. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
To solve this problem, we can start by finding Nate's speed in meters per second:

25 meters / 13.7 seconds ≈ 1.82 meters per second

Then, we can use the formula distance = speed x time to find the distance Nate will walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds):

distance = 1.82 meters/second × 240 seconds
distance ≈ 437 meters

So the closest answer choice is:

Action: Answer("B")  (450 meters is the closest to 437 meters).
Response 7:
To solve this problem, we need to find Nate's walking speed in meters per second. 

We can do that by dividing the distance he walks (25 meters) by the time it takes him to walk that distance (13.7 seconds):

25 meters / 13.7 seconds ≈ 1.82 meters per second

To find how far Nate will walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds), we can multiply his walking speed by the time:

1.82 meters per second × 240 seconds = 436.8 meters

The closest answer choice is B: 450 meters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
To find the distance Nate walks in 1 second, we have to divide the total distance by the total time: 

25 meters ÷ 13.7 seconds ≈ 1.825 meters per second 

To find the distance he walks in 4 minutes (240 seconds), we can multiply his speed by time: 

1.825 meters/second x 240 seconds = 438 meters.

Therefore, the answer is closest to Choice B: 450 meters. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
To find out the distance Nate walks in 1 second, we need to divide 25 meters by 13.7 seconds:

25 meters ÷ 13.7 seconds ≈ 1.82 meters/second

To find out the distance Nate walks in 4 minutes, we need to multiply his rate by the time (in seconds):

1.82 meters/second x 240 seconds = 436.8 meters

Therefore, the closest answer choice is B: 450 meters.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& b=2.35+0.25 x \\& c=1.75+0.40 x\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ represent the price per pound, in dollars, of beef and chicken, respectively, $x$ weeks after July 1 during last summer. What was the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 2.60$
  B: $\$ 2.85$
  C: $\$ 2.95$
  D: $\$ 3.35$
Response 0:
To find the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken, we need to set $b=c$. So, we can solve the system of equations as follows: 

$$\begin{aligned}b&=c \\2.35+0.25x&=1.75+0.40x \\0.15x&=0.60 \\x&=4\end{aligned}$$

So, $x=4$ weeks after July 1. Now we can substitute this value of $x$ into either equation to find the price per pound of beef (which is the same as the price per pound of chicken at this time):

$$b=2.35+0.25(4)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \\$2.95}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \\$2.95}$.
Response 1:
We need to find the value of $x$ when $b=c$. Using the given equations,

$$2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$0.15x=0.60 \Rightarrow x=4$$

So, the prices are equal 4 weeks after July 1. We can find the price by substituting $x=4$ in either equation.

$$b=2.35 + 0.25\cdot 4 = \boxed{\$ 2.45}$$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(None of the Above)}}$ (The closest option is A, but 2.45 is slightly lower than 2.60)
Response 2:
When the price per pound of beef equals the price per pound of chicken,
$$b=c$$
Substituting the given expressions for $b$ and $c$ yields
$$2.35+0.25 x=1.75+0.40 x$$
Solving for $x$,
$$0.15 x=0.6\quad\implies\quad x=4$$
Substituting $x=4$ into the given expression for $b$ yields
$$b=2.35+0.25\cdot 4=2.35+1.00=\$3.35$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(D) } \$ 3.35}$.
Response 3:
Substitute both equations to each other and solve for $x$:
$$\begin{aligned}2.35+0.25 x &= 1.75+0.40 x\\0.15 x &= 0.60 \\x &= 4\end{aligned}$$
Therefore, we need to find the price of beef (b) when x = 4. Substitute this value of $x$ into the first equation: 
$$b=2.35+0.25 \cdot 4=2.35+1=3.35$$
Thus, when the price of beef was equal to the price of chicken, the price per pound of beef was $\boxed{\mathrm{(D) \ }\$3.35}$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
We have to set the equations  $b = c$.  Substituting the given values gives us: $$2.35+0.25 x= 1.75+0.40 x$$Simplifying and solving for $x$, we get $x=8$. Substituting $x=8$ in the equation of $b$, we get the price of beef when it was equal to the price of chicken: $$b = 2.35 + 0.25(8) = 4.35$$Therefore the price of beef was $\$4.35$ when it was equal to the price of chicken. 

Action: Answer("None of the above") 
Response 6:
We can solve the problem by setting $b$ and $c$ equal to each other: $$2.35+0.25 x=1.75+0.40 x$$Solving for $x$: $$0.15 x=0.60\Rightarrow x=4$$Therefore, the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken is: $$\begin{aligned}b&=2.35+0.25 x \\& =2.35+0.25\cdot 4\\& = 2.35+1\\&=\$ 3.35\end{aligned}$$ The answer is $\boxed{\text{(D)}\ \$ 3.35}$.
Response 7:
We need to find the value of x for which $b=c$. So we can solve the equation as follows:

$$2.35+0.25x = 1.75+0.40x$$
$$0.15x = 0.60$$
$$x=4$$

Now we can substitute $x=4$ into either of the two equations to get the price per pound of beef (or chicken) when b=c:

$$b = 2.35+0.25x = 2.35+0.25(4) = \textbf{\$2.35+ \$1.00 = \$3.35}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(D) } \$3.35$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
We want to find when the price per pound of beef is equal to the price per pound of chicken. So $$\begin{aligned} b&=c\\2.35+0.25 x &= 1.75+0.40 x\end{aligned}$$
Solving for $x$, we get $x=6$. 
So the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken is $$\begin{aligned} b&=2.35+0.25 x\\&=2.35+0.25\times6\\&=3.10\end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$ 2.95}$.
Response 9:
We want meat prices to be equal, so we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$: $$2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.4x$$ $$\Rightarrow 0.15x=0.6$$$$\Rightarrow x=4$$
Hence, both prices were established 4 weeks after July, 1st. Let us now substitute $x=4$ in the equation of $b$: $$b=2.35+0.25\times 4=3.35$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \$3.35}$.

Question: Survey Results\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\hlineAnswer & Percent \\\hlineNever & $31.3 \%$ \\\hlineRarely & $24.3 \%$ \\\hlineOften & $13.5 \%$ \\\hlineAlways & $30.9 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the results of a survey in which tablet users were asked how often they would watch video advertisements in order to access streaming content for free. Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
Response 0:
Let's use the formula for conditional probability: $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$, where $A$ is the event "answered 'Always'", and $B$ is the event "did not answer 'Never'".
We can find $P(B)$ as follows: $P(B)=1-P(Never)=1-0.313=0.687$
To find $P(Always\cap B)$, we want to know the proportion of people who answered "Always" out of those who did not answer "Never". So we have: $P(Always\cap B) = \frac{Always}{Rarely+Often+Always}=\frac{0.309}{0.243+0.135+0.309}\approx 0.38$
Putting it all together: $P(Always|B)=\frac{P(Always\cap B)}{P(B)}\approx\frac{0.38}{0.687}\approx0.55\approx \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}$
Response 1:
Let's assume there are 100 tablet users. According to the table, 31.3 of them never watch video ads to access streaming content for free. So, there are $100-31.3=68.7$ tablet users who are not "Never". Out of these $68.7$ tablet users,  $30.9 \%$ of them watch video ads "always". So, 

$30.9 \%$ of $68.7=21.22$

Thus, 21.22 tablet users watch video ads "always" but not "never". Therefore, the closest probability of a tablet user watching ads "always" given they are not watching "never" is:

$\frac{21.22}{68.7}\approx 0.308$, which is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0.31}$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let $N$ be the event of answering "Never," and $A$ be the event of answering "Always." We want to calculate\[P(A|N^c)=\frac{P(A\cap N^c)}{P(N^c)}.\]We can calculate $P(N^c)$ by summing the percentages of answering "Rarely," "Often," and "Always," which is $0.243+0.135+0.309=0.687.$

Since we know each of these events is exclusive, we also have $P(A\cap N^c) = 0.309,$ so \[P(A|N^c) = \frac{0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.45.\]Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 0.45}.$
Response 3:
Let $A$ represent the event that the survey response is "Always" and let $B$ represent the event that the survey response is not "Never". We want to find $P(A|B)$, which is:

$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

We can calculate $P(B)$ as $100\%$ minus the $31.3\%$ who responded "Never":

$$P(B)=100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$$

We're not given the probability of $A \cap B$ directly, but we can use Bayes' theorem to find it:

$$P(A \cap B)=P(B|A)\cdot P(A)=\frac{P(A|B)\cdot P(B)}{P(A|B)\cdot P(B)+P(A|\sim B)\cdot P(\sim B)}$$

where $\sim B$ represents the complement of $B$, i.e. the event that a user answered "Never." 

We know that $P(A)=30.9 \%$, $P(\sim B)=31.3 \% - 0.0 \% = 31.3 \%$, and $P(A|\sim B)=0 \%$ (by definition of conditional probability). Plugging in these values and solving for $P(A|B)$, we get:

$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)+P(\sim B|A)\cdot P(A|\sim B)}=\frac{(13.5 \%) \cdot (30.9 \%)}{(13.5 \%) \cdot (30.9 \%) + (0 \%)\cdot (31.3 \%)} \approx 0.38$$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $0.38$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let $N$, $R$, $O$, and $A$ represent the events that a person answered "Never", "Rarely", "Often", and "Always", respectively. We are interested in finding $P(A|C)$, where $C$ is the complement of $N$. We can use Bayes' Theorem to find this probability: $P(A|C) = \frac{P(C|A)P(A)}{P(C)}$. We know that $P(C|A) = (1 - 0.313 - 0.243 - 0.135) = 0.309$, since everyone must belong to one of these categories (never, rarely, often, or always). We also know that $P(A) = 0.309$, which is the percentage of people who answered "Always". To find $P(C)$, we can use the Law of Total Probability: $P(C) = P(C|N)P(N) + P(C|R)P(R) + P(C|O)P(O) + P(C|A)P(A)$. We know that $P(C|N) = 0$ (since "never" means they didn't watch any ads), $P(N) = 0.313$, $P(C|R) = 0.243/(1-0.313) \approx 0.354$, $P(R) = 0.243$, $P(C|O) = 0.135/(1-0.313) \approx 0.196$, and $P(O) = 0.135$. Plugging in these values, we get: $P(C) = 0 + 0.313 \cdot 0.354 + 0.243 \cdot 0.354 + 0.135 \cdot 0.309 \approx 0.28$. Therefore, $P(A|C) = \frac{0.309 \cdot 0.309}{0.28} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 0.38}$.
Response 6:
Let us calculate the probability of a tablet user answering "Always," given that the user did not answer "Never." We need to take the proportion of users who answered "Always" out of the group that did not answer "Never." So, we are only considering the survey respondents who answered "Rarely," "Often," or "Always." 

The percentage of respondents who did not answer "Never" is $100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%.$
Out of those respondents, the percentage who answered "Always" is $30.9 \%.$
So, the probability of a respondent answering "Always" given that the respondent did not answer "Never" is approximately $\frac{30.9 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.4493,$ which is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }0.45}.$

Therefore, Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's first find the probability of the tablet user not answering Never. This is $100\% - 31.3\% = 68.7\%$. 
Out of this $68.7 \%$, $30.6 \%$ answered "Always". Therefore, the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never" is:

$ \dfrac{30.9\%}{68.7\%} \approx 0.449 \approx \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}$
Response 8:
Let $A =$ the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and $B =$ the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never". We want to find $P(A|B)$, which is the probability that a tablet user answered "Always", given that the tablet user did not answer "Never". Using Bayes' Theorem: $$P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$ We have: 
- $P(A)=0.309$
- $P(Never^c)=0.687$ (where $Never^c =$ the complement of "Never")
- $P(B|A)=1$ (since we know for sure they did not answer "Never")
- $P(B)=P(B|Never)P(Never) + P(B|Rarely)P(Rarely) + P(B|Often)P(Often) + P(B|Always)P(Always) = (0)(0.313) + (0.757)(0.243) + (0.337)(0.135) + (1)(0.309) = 0.4583$
Therefore, we get: $$P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \dfrac{(1)(0.309)}{0.4583} \approx 0.674$$ 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let's first calculate the number of people who did not answer "Never". This is the sum of the percentage of people who chose "Rarely", "Often", and "Always".  
$24.3\%+13.5\%+30.9\%=68.7\%$  
This means that $100\%-68.7\%=31.3\%$ of the people answered "Never".  
Now, we want to find the probability that a person answered "Always" given that they did not answer "Never". This is a conditional probability. We can use the following formula for conditional probabilities:  
$P(\text{Always}|\text{Not Never})=\dfrac{P(\text{Always and Not Never})}{P(\text{Not Never})}$  
"Always and Not Never" means the person answered "Always" and did not answer "Never". This refers to the $30.9\%$ in the table.  
$P(\text{Always and Not Never})=30.9\%$  
$P(\text{Not Never})=100\%-31.3\%=68.7\%$  
Now we can plug into the formula:  
$P(\text{Always}|\text{Not Never})=\dfrac{30.9\%}{68.7\%}\approx 0.449$  
So the closest answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 0.45}$.

Here's the method to solve it:
From the first equation, we get $2x = 3y - 14$, which simplifies to $x = \frac{3}{2}y -7$. Substituting this value of $x$ into the second equation gives $3(\frac{3}{2}y - 7) - 2y = -6$. Simplifying that equation leads us to get $y=2$. Substituting the value of $y$ in $x = \frac{3}{2}y -7$, we get $x = -1$.

Hence, $x-y = -1-2= -3 \implies$ Answer is C (-4).
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B") 

We can solve the system of equations by using elimination. First, multiply the first equation by $(-2)$ and the second equation by $3$, and then add them up:

$$\begin{aligned} -4x+6y&=28\\ 9x-6y&=-18\\ \end{aligned} $$

Summing up both, we get:

$$5x=10\implies x=2$$

Substituting x=2 in either of the original equations, we get $y=4$. Therefore, $x-y=2-4=-2$. Thus, the answer is B) -8.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")  

To solve the system of equations, we can multiply the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$, then subtract the resulting second equation from the first multiplied equation. This will eliminate $x$ from the resulting equation and give us the value of $y$:
$$\begin{aligned} 4x-6y&=-28\\ 9x-6y&=-18\\ \hline -5x&=-10 \end{aligned}$$
So we have $x=2$. We can then substitute $x=2$ in either of the original equations to find $y$:
$$\begin{aligned} 2 (2)-3 y&=-14\\ y&=8\\ \end{aligned}$$
Finally, we can calculate $x-y$ as $2-8=-6$. Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(B)}$ $-8$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")  

Solution:

From the system, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$:

\begin{align*}
2x-3y &=-14 \\
2x &= 3y-14 \\
x &=\frac{3}{2}y-7
\end{align*}

Substitute this value of $x$ into the second equation:

\begin{align*}
3x-2y &= -6 \\
3\left(\frac{3}{2}y-7\right)-2y &= -6 \\
\frac{9}{2}y-21-2y &= -6 \\
\frac{5}{2}y &= 15 \\
y &= 6
\end{align*}

Now that we have $y=6$, we can substitute it back into either equation to solve for $x$:

\begin{align*}
2x-3y &=-14 \\
2x-3(6) &=-14 \\
2x &= 16 \\
x &= 8
\end{align*}

Therefore, $(x,y) = (8,6)$, and $x-y=2$. The correct answer is (D).
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")  

We can solve this system of equations by either substitution or elimination method. By elimination method, we can multiply the first equation by $-2$ and the second equation by $3$, and then add them together.
$$\begin{aligned}&(4x-6y=-28)+(9x-6y=-18) \\ \Rightarrow &(4x+9x)+(-6y-6y)=-28-18 \\ \Rightarrow & 13x=-46\\ \Rightarrow & x=-\frac{46}{13}.\end{aligned}$$
Now, we can substitute the value of $x$ into either of the equations, say the first one, and solve for $y.$
$$\begin{aligned} 2\left(-\frac{46}{13}\right)-3y&=-14 \\ \Rightarrow -\frac{92}{13}-3y&=-14 \\ \Rightarrow -3y&=\frac{30}{13} \\ \Rightarrow y&=-\frac{10}{39} \end{aligned}$$
Finally, we can evaluate $x-y$ as follows:
$$x-y=-\frac{46}{13}+\frac{10}{39} =-\frac{260}{39}=-\frac{20}{3}\approx -6.67.$$
Therefore, the answer is $x-y\approx -6.67,$ which is closest to $\boxed{\mathrm{(B) \ } -8}$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can solve the system by multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to obtain:
$$\begin{aligned}&6x-9y=-42 \\&6x-4y=-12\end{aligned}$$
Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate $x$:
$$5y=-30$$
So $y=-6$. Substituting this value into either equation, we can solve for $x$:
$$2x-3(-6)=-14$$
$$2x=4$$
$$x=2$$
Therefore, $x-y=2-(-6)=8$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")  

Solving the system of equations:
$$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$
We get, $x= 6$ and $y=4$. Therefore,  $x-y=6-4=2$.
Response 8:
We can solve the system of equations in several ways and find that the solution is $(x,y)=(-9,-4)$. Therefore, $x-y=-9-(-4)=$Action: Answer("A")-5$.
Response 9:
Multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, we get $$\begin{aligned}& \begin{aligned}(2) \cdot(2 x-3 y)&=(2) \cdot(-14) \\& \Rightarrow 4 x-6 y=-28 \end{aligned}\\&   \begin{aligned}(3) \cdot(3 x-2 y)&=(3) \cdot(-6) \\& \Rightarrow 9 x-6 y=-18 \end{aligned}\end{aligned}$$Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we have $$\begin{aligned}(4 x-6 y)-(9 x-6 y)=(-28)-(-18) \\ \Rightarrow -5 x=-10\end{aligned}$$Thus, we get $x=2$. Substituting $x=2$ in any of the above equation, we get $y=-3$. Therefore, $x-y=2-(-3)=5$. 

Hence, the answer is $\boldsymbol{(D)\: 8}$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
We know that if a line passes through the origin $(0,0)$ and has a slope of $m$, the equation of the line is $y=mx$. Here, the slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$, so the equation of the line is $y=\frac{1}{7}x$. Let's substitute each point into this equation and see which one works:  
A: $(0,7) \Rightarrow 7 = \frac{1}{7}(0)$. This point does not lie on the line because $y \neq 0$.  
B: $(1,7) \Rightarrow 7 = \frac{1}{7}(1)$. This point does not lie on the line because the equation is satisfied only if $x=7$.  
C: $(7,7) \Rightarrow 7 = \frac{1}{7}(7)$. This point lies on the line.  
D: $(14,2) \Rightarrow 2 = \frac{1}{7}(14)$. This point does not lie on the line because the equation is satisfied only if $y=2$.  

Therefore, the point that lies on the line is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ (7,7)}$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
We can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to solve this question. The point-slope form of a line with slope $m$ passing through the point $(x_1, y_1)$ is given by:

$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

In this case, the line passes through the origin $(0,0)$ and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Therefore, the equation of the line is:

$y - 0 = \frac{1}{7}(x - 0)$

which simplifies to:

$y = \frac{1}{7}x$

Now we can plug in each of the answer choices and see which ones satisfy this equation:

(A) $(0,7)$:
$7 \neq \frac{1}{7}(0)$ (not on the line)

(B) $(1,7)$:
$7 \neq \frac{1}{7}(1)$ (not on the line)

(C) $(7,7)$:
$7 = \frac{1}{7}(7)$ (on the line)

(D) $(14,2)$:
$2 \neq \frac{1}{7}(14)$ (not on the line)

Therefore, the point that lies on the given line is (C) $(7,7)$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Solution: Since the line passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$, we know that any point $(x,y)$ on the line must satisfy $y=\frac{1}{7} x$. Thus, the $y$-coordinate of the point $(0,7)$ is $\frac{1}{7}(0)=0$, which means that $(0,7)$ lies on the line.
Response 6:
We know that the line passes through the origin, which means the $y$-intercept is $0$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=\frac{1}{7}x$. 

To check which of the given points lie on the line, we can substitute the $x$ and $y$ values of each point into the equation of the line and check if the equation holds true.

Checking the first point, $(0,7)$, we get $y=\frac{1}{7}x = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 0 = 0 \neq 7$. Therefore, this point does not lie on the line.

Checking the second point, $(1,7)$, we get $y=\frac{1}{7}x = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{7} \neq 7$. Therefore, this point does not lie on the line.

Checking the third point, $(7,7)$, we get $y=\frac{1}{7}x = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 7 = 1 = 7$. Therefore, this point lies on the line.

Checking the fourth point, $(14,2)$, we get $y=\frac{1}{7}x = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 14 = 2 \neq 2$. Therefore, this point does not lie on the line.

Therefore, the point that lies on the line is $(7, 7)$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
To solve this problem, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of the line, which gives the equation $y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_0, y_0)$ is a point on the line. Since the line passes through the origin, we have $y - 0 = \frac{1}{7}(x - 0)$, which simplifies to $y = \frac{1}{7}x$. To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of each point into the equation and see if the equation is true. 

Action: Answer("A")  

The point $(0, 7)$ gives $y = \frac{1}{7}(0) = 0$, which is not equal to 7, so it does not lie on the line. 

Action: Answer("B")  

The point $(1, 7)$ gives $y = \frac{1}{7}(1) = \frac{1}{7}$, which is not equal to 7, so it does not lie on the line. 

Action: Answer("C")  

The point $(7, 7)$ gives $y = \frac{1}{7}(7) = 1$, which is not equal to 7, so it does not lie on the line. 

Action: Answer("D")  

The point $(14, 2)$ gives $y = \frac{1}{7}(14) = 2$, which is equal to 2, so this point does not lie on the line. 

Therefore, none of the given points lie on the line. 
Action: Answer("E") 
Response 9:
To find the equation of the line, we can use the point-slope formula:
$$y-0 = \frac{1}{7}(x-0)$$
Simplifying, we get $y =\frac{1}{7}x$. Now we can check which point(s) satisfy this equation:
$$A: (0,7) \rightarrow 7 \neq \frac{1}{7}(0)$$
$$B: (1,7) \rightarrow 7 = \frac{1}{7}(1)$$
$$C: (7,7) \rightarrow 7 = \frac{1}{7}(7)$$
$$D: (14,2) \rightarrow 2 \neq \frac{1}{7}(14)$$
Therefore, the point on the line is (B) $(1,7)$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 0:
Let $x$ be the number of cups of Super Grain cereal. Since the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, we can set up the following equation: 

$210\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) + 240x = 270$

Simplifying the equation gives us:

$157.5 + 240x = 270$

$240x = 112.5$

$x = \frac{112.5}{240} = \frac{3}{8}$

Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{3}{8}$ cup Super Grain cereal with $\frac{5}{8}$ cup Crunchy Grain cereal. 

So the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $y$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 
Then, the total number of calories in the mixture is: 
$240x + \frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}y = 240x + 280y$
Since we know that the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, we can set up the equation: 
$\frac{240x+280y}{x+y}=270$
Multiplying both sides by $x+y$, we get: 
$240x+280y=270(x+y)$
$240x+280y=270x+270y$
$10x=10y$
$x=y$
Therefore, Jennifer uses the same amount of Super Grain and Crunchy Grain cereal. 
Since one cup of the mixture should have $\frac{270}{240+210}=\frac{27}{26}$ cups of Super Grain cereal, we have: 

$1$ cup of mixture = $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal + $x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal 

$1 = \frac{27}{26}x + \frac{3}{4}x$ 

$1 = \frac{135}{104}x$ 

$x = \frac{104}{135}$

So, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{104}{135}$ cups, which is approximately $\frac{3}{8}$ cups. 

Thus, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Let $x$ denote the amount of Super Grain cereal in cups. One cup of the mixture has 270 calories. The Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per  $\frac{3}{4}\operatorname{ cup}$. Therefore, one cup of the mixture has \[
\frac{4}{3} \cdot 210=280
\] calories from Crunchy Grain cereal. Thus, one cup of the mixture has \[
280+240 x
\] total calories. Setting this expression equal to 270 yields $x=\frac{1}{4}$, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 3:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture, measured in cups. The number of calories in the mixture is the sum of the calories from Crunchy Grain and Super Grain cereal. The number of calories from Crunchy Grain in one cup of the mixture is:
\begin{align*}
\frac{3}{4}\text{ cup of Crunchy Grain}\cdot\frac{210\text{ calories}}{1\text{ serving}} &= \frac{3\cdot 210}{4}\text{ calories}.
\end{align*}
The amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $x$ cups, so the number of calories from Super Grain in one cup of the mixture is:
\begin{align*}
x\text{ cup of Super Grain}\cdot\frac{240\text{ calories}}{1\text{ cup}} &= 240x\text{ calories}.
\end{align*}
Together, these must add up to 270 calories:
\begin{align*}
\frac{3\cdot 210}{4}\text{ calories}+240x\text{ calories}&=270\text{ calories}\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 630+960x&=1080\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 960x&=450\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x&=\frac{450}{960}=\frac{15}{32}
\end{align*}
So in one cup of the mixture, there are $\frac{15}{32}$ cups of Super Grain cereal. To check that this answer makes sense, note that $\frac{3}{4}+\frac{15}{32} = \frac{24+15}{32} = \frac{39}{32} > 1$, which means something went awry, so we should look back over the calculations. To add $\frac{3}{4}$ and $\frac{15}{32}$, we need to find a common denominator. We could use $32\cdot 4$ as a common denominator, but let's stick with $32$ and convert $\frac{3}{4}$ to $2\cdot \frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{2}{2}=\frac{6}{8}$ before adding:
\begin{align*}
\frac{3}{4}+\frac{15}{32} &= \frac{24}{32}+\frac{15}{32}\\
&= \frac{39}{32}.
\end{align*}
This makes sense, since the sum of two positive quantities is always larger than either quantity by itself. Thus, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{15}{32}$, which simplifies to $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\frac{1}{3}\text{ cup}}$ when expressed in terms of cups.
Response 4:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture, measured in cups. 

The amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x$ cups. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from Crunchy Grain cereal and the calories from Super Grain cereal: 

$210(\frac{1-x}{\frac{3}{4}})+240x=270$

Simplifying by multiplying both sides by $\frac{3}{4}$, we get:
$210(1-x)+320x=270\cdot\frac{3}{4}$
$210-210x+320x=202.5$
$110x=7.5$
$x=\frac{15}{220}=\frac{3}{44}$

Thus, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } \frac{1}{8}\text{ cup}}$.
Response 5:
Let's say the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal Jennifer uses in the mixture is $x$ cups. According to the information given in the question, each $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories, so $x$ cups provide $\frac{210x}{\frac{3}{4}}=\frac{840x}{3}$ calories. In addition, we know that each $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 50 fat calories, so $x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal provide $\frac{50x}{\frac{3}{4}}=\frac{200x}{3}$ fat calories.

If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer’s mixture is 270 and $\frac{840 x}{3}+240 y=270(y+x)$, then solving for $y$, the quantity of Super Grain cereal used, yields $y=\frac{x}{2}$. Thus, there is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}}$ of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture.
Response 6:
Let $x$ be the amount (in cups) of Super Grain cereal.
There are $240x$ calories from the Super Grain cereal.
There are $210$ calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal, which can be rewritten as $280$ calories per cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. Therefore, there are $280\left(1-x\right)$ calories from Crunchy Grain cereal.
The total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is $240x+280\left(1-x\right)=280-40x$. Setting this value equal to $270$ yields $x=\frac{1}{4}$.
Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Let's assume that Jennifer will mix $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal.
The total number of calories from the Super Grain cereal is $240x$, and the total number of calories from $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{210}{3} \cdot 2 = 140$ calories. Together, they provide 270 calories in total. Therefore, we can write an equation:
$$240x + 140 = 270$$
$$240x = 130$$
$$x = \frac{13}{24}$$
This means that Jennifer will mix $\frac{13}{24}$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal.
To find the answer to the question, we need to calculate how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture. We know that the total amount of cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{13}{24} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{19}{24}$ cups. Therefore, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is:
$$\frac{\frac{13}{24}}{\frac{19}{24}} = \frac{13}{19} \approx \frac{2}{3}$$
Thus, the answer is approximately $\frac{2}{3}$ cup which is closest to answer C: $\frac{1}{3}$ cup. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

We know that $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories. Since 50 of these calories are from fat, the remaining 160 calories are not from fat. Therefore, 1 cup of Crunchy Grain cereal that provides $160/\frac{3}{4} \times 1 = 213.\bar{3}$ calories.

Hence, the equation for the total calories in one cup of the mixture can be written as: 

$240x + 213.\bar{3} = 270$

$240x = 56.7$

$x \approx 0.236$\approx $\frac{1}{4}$

Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\approx \frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal for her breakfast.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Let x be the amount (in cups) of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. Then, we know that the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal is $1 - x$. From this, we can set up the following equations:
$$240x + 210\left(1-x\right) = 270$$
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
$$240x + 210 - 210x = 270$$
$$30x = 60$$
$$x=\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{3}\operatorname{cup}}.$

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$$The equation above gives the height $h$, in feet, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is thrown straight up with an initial speed of $v$ feet per second from a height of $k$ feet. Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: $v=h+k-16 t$
  B: $v=\frac{h-k+16}{t}$
  C: $v=\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$
  D: $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$
Response 0:
To obtain $v$, we need to differentiate the formula for $h = -16t^2+vt+k$ with respect to $t$: 
$$\frac{d h}{d t}=\frac{d}{d t}(-16 t^{2}+v t+k)$$ 
The derivative of the constant $k$ is 0, so: 
$$\frac{d h}{d t}= -32t +v$$ 
Simplifying further: 
$$v = 32t + \frac{d h}{d t}$$ 
Now replace $\frac{d h}{d t}$ with $-16(2t)$: 
$$v = 32t - 32t = -16t$$ 
Finally, we substitute back the initial equation for $h$ to get the expression for $v$ in terms of $h$, $t$, and $k$: 
$$h = -16t^2 -16t+ k  \ \implies \  v = -16t + \sqrt{256t^2-64k+64h} \ \text{(the positive root)}$$

After simplifying the expression, we get $v=\frac{-16t+\sqrt{256t^{2}-64k+64h}}{2}$. 
So the answer is: 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
To solve for $v$ we can manipulate the given equation as follows:  $$h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$$ $$h-k=-16 t^{2}+v t$$ $$v t=h-k+16 t^{2}$$ $$v=\frac{h-k+16 t^{2}}{t}$$

Therefore the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")

  B: $3 x+4 y=6$
  C: $2 x+4 y=6$
  D: $2 x+6 y=3$
Response 0:
Recall that two lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is $-1 .$ Solve the given equation for $y$ to get $y=\frac{2}{3} x+2 .$ The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3} .$ The line with slope $-1 / \frac{2}{3}=-\frac{3}{2}$ is the line with slope $\frac{3}{2}$ $$\Rightarrow y=\frac{3}{2} x+b.$$ Substituting $(-2,2)$ gives $2=\frac{3}{2} \cdot(-2)+b \Rightarrow b=8 .$ Therefore, the equation of the line perpendicular to the given equation is $y=\frac{3}{2} x+8$ and $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 2x+6y=3}$ is the equation of the line.
Response 1:
We can determine whether two equations are perpendicular by checking if the product of their slopes is $-1$. 

First, let's write the equation $-2x + 3y = 6$ in slope-intercept form by solving for $y$: 

$$3y = 2x + 6 \Rightarrow y = \frac{2}{3} x + 2$$

So the slope of the line represented by $-2x + 3y = 6$ is $\frac{2}{3}$. 

Now we can check which of the equations have slopes that are negative reciprocals of $\frac{2}{3}$: 

A: $3x + 2y = 6 \Rightarrow 2y = -3x + 6 \Rightarrow y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3$. The slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$, which is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. 

B: $3x + 4y = 6 \Rightarrow 4y = -3x + 6 \Rightarrow y = -\frac{3}{4}x + \frac{3}{4}$. The slope is $-\frac{3}{4}$, which is NOT the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$.

C: $2x + 4y = 6 \Rightarrow 4y = -2x + 6 \Rightarrow y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}$. The slope is $-\frac{1}{2}$, which is NOT the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$.

D: $2x + 6y = 3 \Rightarrow 6y = -2x + 3 \Rightarrow y = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{2}$. The slope is $-\frac{1}{3}$, which is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(D) }2x+6y=3$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
We can rearrange the given equation to $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. Therefore, the slope of the given line is $\frac{2}{3}$.

Two lines in the $xy$-plane are perpendicular if and only if their slopes multiply to -1. We need the equation whose slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$ because $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)=-1$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To find a line perpendicular to a given line, we need to find its slope and then find a line with a slope negative reciprocal to it. The slope of $-2x+3y=6$ can be found by rearranging it into slope-intercept form: $$y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$$ The negative reciprocal of $2/3$ is $-3/2$. So, we need to look for the equation of a line with slope $-3/2$. Option A has slope $-3/2$, so the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
First, we can think about the equation given. We can rewrite it to slope-intercept form, which is $y = \frac{2}{3} x +2$. From this form, we can see that the slope of the line is $\frac{2}{3}$.

In order for a line to be perpendicular to this line, it has to have a slope that is negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$.

We can now check which equation has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$ by rewriting each equation into slope-intercept form.

A: $3x + 2y = 6$ can be rearranged to $y = -\frac{3}{2} x + 3$. This one works!
B: $3x + 4y = 6$ can be rearranged to $y = -\frac{3}{4} x + \frac{3}{4}$. This one does not work.
C: $2x + 4y = 6$ can be rearranged to $y = -\frac{1}{2} x + \frac{3}{2}$. This one does not work.
D: $2x + 6y = 3$ can be rearranged to $y = -\frac{1}{3} x + \frac{1}{2}$. This one does not work.

Therefore, the answer is A: $3x + 2y = 6$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
The given equation can be written in slope-intercept form as $y = \frac{2}{3}x+2$.  The slope of the given line is $\frac{2}{3}$.  The slopes of the lines in choices A, B, C and D can be found by writing them in slope-intercept form.  

A) $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$.  Slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$ which means that the lines are perpendicular since we have $m_1m_2=-1$.

B) $y=-\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{3}{4}$.  Since slope of this line is negative and non-zero, it cannot be perpendicular to the given line.

C) $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+1.5$.  Slope is $-\frac{1}{2}$ which means that the lines are perpendicular since we have $m_1m_2=-1$.

D) $y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$.  Since slope of this line is negative and non-zero, it cannot be perpendicular to the given line.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }3x+2y=6}$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To solve the problem, we need to find the slope of the given line. So we can write the equation in slope form as:  
$$y=(2/3)x+2$$
The slope of this line is $2/3$. We know that the slopes of two perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals of each other. So the slope of the line perpendicular to the given line must be $-3/2$.

Now, let's check the choices and find the slope of each line:  
A: $3x+2y=6 \Rightarrow 2y=-3x+6 \Rightarrow y=-(3/2)x+3$, slope is $-3/2$, correct  

B: $3x+4y=6 \Rightarrow 4y=-3x+6 \Rightarrow y=-(3/4)x+3/2$, slope is $-3/4$, incorrect  

C: $2x+4y=6 \Rightarrow 4y=-2x+6 \Rightarrow y=-(1/2)x+3/2$, slope is $-1/2$, incorrect  

D: $2x+6y=3 \Rightarrow 6y=-2x+3 \Rightarrow y=-(1/3)x+1/2$, slope is $-1/3$, incorrect  

Therefore, the answer is (A) $3x+2y=6$.

Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
Response 0:
To convert miles to kilometers, we can multiply the number of miles by 1.6093. To find how many kilometers below the sea's surface the Beebe Vent Field is, we need to divide 3.1 miles by 0.6214 miles/km. 

Action: Answer("C") 

To be exact, $3.1/0.6214 \approx 4.99$, so the answer is closer to 5 kilometers than 4 kilometers. However, since 4 is the closest option, we choose C.
Response 1:
To convert miles to kilometers, we need to multiply the number of miles by 1.60934. So, the vent is approximately:

Action: Answer("C") 

$3.1 \text{ miles} \times 1.60934 \approx 4.99 \text{ kilometers}$ 

Therefore, the answer is C.

Response 7:
We can solve the system of equations using any method we prefer. For example, using elimination,

$$\begin{aligned}& k x-3 y=4 \\& 4 x-5 y=7\end{aligned}$$

Multiplying the first equation by 4, we get:

$$\begin{aligned}& 4k x-12 y=16 \\& 4 x-5 y=7\end{aligned}$$

We can now eliminate $x$ by subtracting the second equation from the first:

$$4k x - 4 x - 12 y +5 y =16-7$$

Simplifying:

$$\begin{aligned}& (4k-4) x - 7 y = 9 \\& (4k-4) x = 7 y + 9\end{aligned}$$

If we divide the second equation by $(4k-4)$, we get:

$$x = \frac{7}{4k-4} y + \frac{9}{4k-4}$$

If $4k -4=0$, then we have $x$ expressed as a linear function of $y$ and the two equations represent two parallel lines. Therefore, there will be no solution.

Solving $4k-4=0$, we get $k = 1$.

Therefore, for $k=1$, the system of equations has no solution.

  C: 2
  D: 4
Response 0:
Solution: 
Given, $\frac{2 a}{b} = \frac{1}{2}$
Multiplying both sides by $\frac{b}{2},$ we get
$a = \frac{b}{4}$
Dividing both sides by $a,$ we get
$\frac{b}{a} = 4$
Answer: Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
We can start by cross-multiplying the given equation, which gives $4a=b$. Therefore, $$\frac{b}{a} = \frac{4a}{a} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }4}.$$
Response 3:
Multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{2 a}{b}=\frac{1}{2}$ by $\frac{b}{2}$ to get $a = \frac{b}{4}$. Therefore, $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{4}{1} = 4$.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Given $\frac{2 a}{b}=\frac{1}{2}$, we can solve for b/a as follows:
$$
\frac{2 a}{b}=\frac{1}{2}
$$
$$\implies 2a = \frac{b}{2} = \frac{b}{2}\cdot\frac{a}{a} = \frac{ab}{2a}$$
$$\implies 4a^2 = b a$$
$$\implies \frac{b}{a} = 4$$

Therefore, the answer is (D) $4$. 

(Action: Answer("D"))
Response 5:
We start by multiplying both sides of the equation by $\frac{b}{2}$ to obtain the expression $\frac{2a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{b}{2}.$ Simplifying, we get $\frac{a}{2} = \frac{b}{4}.$ Dividing both sides by $\frac{a}{2},$ we obtain $\frac{b}{a} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }2}.$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
We can solve for $\frac{b}{a}$ by manipulating the given equation $\frac{2 a}{b}=\frac{1}{2}$:
$$\frac{2a}{b}=\frac{1}{2} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 4a=b \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{b}{a}=\frac{4a}{a}=4$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 4}$.
Response 8:
Solution: 

We can start this problem by solving for one of the variables in terms of the other using the given equation. 

$\frac{2 a}{b}=\frac{1}{2}$ 

Multiplying both sides by $b,$ we get 

$2a = \frac{b}{2}$ 

Or $b= 4a.$ 

So, 

$\frac{b}{a} = \frac{4a}{a} =4.$ 


Answer: $\boxed{\text{(D)}\ 4}$
Response 9:

Topic: Health
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to fix bent glasses [title] Grab a pair of plastic-tipped pliers. [step] Pliers will allow you to make micro-adjustments to the bent frames more safely than trying to force them into shape by hand. If possible, equip yourself with a pair that has a soft plastic coating on the tips.
Choices:
  A: Ordinary metal pliers may scratch or even snap thin wire frames. [substeps] If you don't have a suitable set of pliers on hand, a plastic hand clamp or pair of forceps will also get the job done.
  B: Otherwise, you can simply hold the pair of pliers in your hand and allow them to slip out of place. [title] Lift the lens with the tips of the pliers.
  C: [substeps] Metal cases are among the cheapest materials available, but they'll make this much more difficult. If you can't find plastic-tip pliers, your dentist will probably opt for glass cases instead.
  D: Soft plastic can be better than hard plastic. [substeps] The purpose behind the plastic is to enhance the appearance of the lenses, while making them easier to clean and replace.

Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make your hair grow faster [title] Include protein in your daily diet. [step] Your hair and nails are primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Hair growth has three phases: anagen (when hair is growing), catagen (when growth starts to shut down), and telogen (when growth stops and/or the hair falls out).
Choices:
  A: Each phasema has a 5 to 10 percent impact on hair quality. In general, the more protein you consume, the faster your hair growth will begin.
  B: [substeps] Protein is important, both for building and maintaining hair's growth-and making it thinner by increasing the amount of protein your body burns. This will help support your hair's growth.
  C: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.
  D: They are not differentiated from hair that is entirely corn. [substeps] High protein foods should be added to your diet to ensure optimal hair-growth.

[header] How to give yourself a brazilian wax [title] Buy a good sugaring wax. [step] These are generally available at most large retail stores, but you may find more options at beauty supply stores. [substeps] A waxing product such as nair roll-on wax is a good choice because it has a roll-on applicator that dispenses an even amount of wax over the surface.

  A: [title] Cut the waxing strips into small strips. [step] These can be bought (sometimes coming with the wax) or homemade.
  B: The adhesive also helps to prevent the wax from drying out. [title] Apply the wax to your hair, turning it around when you're done.
  C: Apply the wax to your hair in a nice, even layer. Start on the mid-hair--all the way up to the roots-and then remove the wax.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to get oil out of hair [title] Shampoo your hair several times. [step] Use your regular shampoo to wash your hair in the shower. Really work the shampoo into your scalp using your fingers and rinse it out thoroughly with lukewarm water.
Choices:
  A: Rinse your hair as soon as possible after it is done, as prolonged washing can hurt the scalp. [title] Dry your hair as soon as possible.
  B: Have a good conditioner available on hand for long-term use. [substeps] Because oil can build up if you're not getting it regular, don't rinse it out very often, as this may clog or unbalance the hair follicles.
  C: Repeat the process one or two more times, as needed. [substeps] After you finish shampooing, add some conditioner to your hair and let it sit for 5 minutes before rinsing out.
  D: [substeps] You can use a hairdryer, a microfiber cloth, or a shower cap to gently detangle your hair to avoid spreading the oil or holding your hair in. [title] Squeeze a dime-sized amount of shampoo from a bottle.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to dry shoes quickly [title] Look at the construction of your shoes. [step] If they are synthetic or cotton, without hard or gelled soles, they can go into the dryer. Leather, gel-core athletic shoes, clogs and gore-tex should not go into the washer or dryer.
Choices:
  A: [title] Wash them first if they are caked with mud. [step] Either rinse them with a garden hose or put them through an entire washer cycle.
  B: Shoes could be permanently damaged if dirt and debris are not removed with the help of microbes. Typical finishes of shoes should be white and reasonably soft.
  C: Of course, if they aren't synthetic, place them into the washing machine with the proper temperature. [substeps] Avoid using steel wool or other aggressively abrasive laers, as these can damage the rubber soles of a properly-made pair of shoes.
  D: Synthetic synthetic shoes do not absorb as well as polyester/plastic soft shoes, so in most cases you will need to replace them later. [substeps] Steamers and other lubricants are best, but any dry pair of shoes should be fine.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to ripen a cantaloupe [title] Check the cantaloupe once the color changes. [step] Never harvest a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green, since these melons are undoubtedly unripe. Once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, though, it is probably ripe.
Choices:
  A: [title] Place the cantaloupe in a container for ripeness. [step] Placing your cantaloupe on its side will produce ripeness.
  B: [substeps] If the cantaloupe has very dark spots, blackheads, or dark spots, it is ripe. If the spots appear darker, or have a splotchy look to them, it may be ripe.
  C: If the cantaloupe turns a light brown after you slice it, or stays green, it is ripe. [title] Place the cantaloupe on the cutting board with its skin facing down.
  D: [substeps] Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet.

### Exam: hellaswag_val-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make short legs look longer [title] Wear clothes that fit. [step] Fitted pants and tops that seem custom made for your body will make you look long and lean. If you're petite, shop in the petite section of stores to boost your chances of finding clothes that fit properly.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Baggy and ill-fitting clothes will only make you look frumpy, and will do nothing to lengthen your legs. Avoid buying clothes that don't fit you perfectly.
  B: This is a fine location for height-conscious people to look, but avoid gaudy clothes that show interest in the female genitalia. [title] Accentuate the things that help you look.
  C: [substeps] For instance, if you weigh 13, you should accentuate your body's inner thighs by wearing items high enough so that your thighs are above your hips. If you don't particularly want to highlight your curves, pick short skirts or dresses that fall nicely and that hug your waist without drapes.
  D: Your wardrobe should also remind you that a bit of your figure is confined in all different ways and only when clothing accentuates or constricts these curves you can look the part. [substeps] Wear vertical stripes to make your legs look shorter.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to talk to a child about a bad grade [title] Explain the problem to the child how they would understand it. [step] Tell them that without good grades, many people won't be interested in hiring them for a job when they grow up. [title] Avoid negativity.
Choices:
  A: [step] This doesn't help children with adhd find employment. Make sure your concern regarding a problem goes beyond what adults would actually say.
  B: [step] It's fine to be upset with your child, but calling him/her a " failure " or commenting on his/her " stupidity " will only cause a decrease in self esteem. Degrading remarks can hurt more than you know.
  C: [step] Studies show that most people actually want to work, even before they reach 3 years old. [title] Tell the child why they need a job.
  D: [step] Since preschool age children cannot achieve success in school and some teachers are no longer motivated to work with them, they may feel incomplete or powerless to make their students feel successful. Stay calm and upbeat that the child is competent and capable of making good grades.

### Exam: hellaswag_val-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to apply eyeliner to small round eyes [title] Apply a light-colored eyeliner to your waterline. [step] Use a white or nude colored eyeliner for the best results. Light colors will open and brighten your eyes so they look bigger.
Choices:
  A: You will need to apply the eyeliner in this color to begin with. Then, move on to your waterline and then your eyelid.
  B: Focus on your waterline when working with eyeliner. [substeps] For more precise eye work, get a small eye brush (such as a toothpick, eyebrow brush, or electric wand), and water that goes with eyeliner on smaller, streaky areas.
  C: [substeps] Apply a softer line of eyeliner on your waterline for a more natural look. Avoid applying eyeliner all the way across your waterline if you have close-set eyes, as this will make them appear closer together.
  D: [substeps] Only use white eyeliner for brown eyes. Otherwise, the eyeliner won't pop as much and will sink into your eyebrows and make your eyes look round.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to fix bent glasses [title] Grab a pair of plastic-tipped pliers. [step] Pliers will allow you to make micro-adjustments to the bent frames more safely than trying to force them into shape by hand. If possible, equip yourself with a pair that has a soft plastic coating on the tips.

  C: [substeps] Metal cases are among the cheapest materials available, but they'll make this much more difficult. If you can't find plastic-tip pliers, your dentist will probably opt for glass cases instead.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

[header] How to dry shoes quickly [title] Look at the construction of your shoes. [step] If they are synthetic or cotton, without hard or gelled soles, they can go into the dryer. Leather, gel-core athletic shoes, clogs and gore-tex should not go into the washer or dryer.
Choices:
  A: [title] Wash them first if they are caked with mud. [step] Either rinse them with a garden hose or put them through an entire washer cycle.
  B: Shoes could be permanently damaged if dirt and debris are not removed with the help of microbes. Typical finishes of shoes should be white and reasonably soft.
  C: Of course, if they aren't synthetic, place them into the washing machine with the proper temperature. [substeps] Avoid using steel wool or other aggressively abrasive laers, as these can damage the rubber soles of a properly-made pair of shoes.
  D: Synthetic synthetic shoes do not absorb as well as polyester/plastic soft shoes, so in most cases you will need to replace them later. [substeps] Steamers and other lubricants are best, but any dry pair of shoes should be fine.

Response 0:
Knowledge: The question is asking for the most likely completion to the text. The text describes a man training for weightlifting events in the Olympics. The man picks up weight and lifts it over his head several times.

B: This choice is possible, but it is not the most likely completion because the text already describes the man lifting weights over his head, so it is redundant to say that he puts them down to raise them above his head again. 

C: This choice is unlikely because it does not make sense in the context of weightlifting.

  A: [step] This doesn't help children with adhd find employment. Make sure your concern regarding a problem goes beyond what adults would actually say.
  B: [step] It's fine to be upset with your child, but calling him/her a " failure " or commenting on his/her " stupidity " will only cause a decrease in self esteem. Degrading remarks can hurt more than you know.
  C: [step] Studies show that most people actually want to work, even before they reach 3 years old. [title] Tell the child why they need a job.
  D: [step] Since preschool age children cannot achieve success in school and some teachers are no longer motivated to work with them, they may feel incomplete or powerless to make their students feel successful. Stay calm and upbeat that the child is competent and capable of making good grades.

Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?

[step] There are many good solutions available both over the counter and with a doctor's prescription.

Choices:
  A: [title] Read the label on the product before you make your purchase. [step] Look for ingredients that have been proven effective in reducing wrinkles and fine line.

Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.

  B: [substeps] For instance, if your child wakes up about an hour before naptime, have them break out his ready-made lunch so they can have enough time to eat before naptime. If your child usually wakes up hours before naptime, try a more gradual recording of their wake time.
  C: Note what time your child goes to bed, what time they wake up, and any naps they take during the day. You should try to identify any patterns in your child's sleep, and if noise, hunger, light or too many naps during the day are causing the early wake time.

[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

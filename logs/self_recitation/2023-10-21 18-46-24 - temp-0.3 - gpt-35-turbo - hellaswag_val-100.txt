Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

  B: This option is unlikely as it contradicts the initial text which describes the fire as already burning brightly.
  C: This option is possible, but it does not provide a continuation of the text. It rather describes how to light and put out a campfire.
  D: This option is unlikely as it describes a dangerous situation that is not related to the initial text.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: 
  The sentence describes a campfire burning brightly in the night, which suggests that the fire is already going strong. 
  Option B suggests that the fire is slowly growing in size, which contradicts the initial description of a fire that is already burning brightly. 
  Option C describes a specific method for lighting and putting out a fire that is not mentioned in the initial sentence. 
  Option D suggests that the fire is out of control and spreading, which is not the intended meaning of the sentence.

  A: This choice provides a likely completion to the sentence by describing how the fire appears to be dancing and how people are watching it flame.
  B: This choice suggests that the fire is slowly growing in size, but the sentence already states that the fire is burning brightly, so this choice is less likely.
  C: This choice describes how to light a campfire and put it out behind an iron grill, but it does not provide a likely completion to the sentence.
  D: This choice suggests that the fire is rapidly spreading across the ground, which is unlikely since the sentence already states that the fire is burning brightly in the night.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

  Option D is unlikely because it suggests that the fire is out of control and spreading rapidly, which is not a desirable outcome when starting a campfire.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: 
  The sentence describes a campfire burning brightly in the night, which suggests that the fire is already established and burning well. 
  Option B is unlikely because it suggests that the fire is still growing in size, which would not be described as a fire that is already burning brightly. 
  Option C is unlikely because it describes a specific method of lighting and extinguishing a fire, but the sentence does not provide any context for how the fire was started or how it will be put out. 
  Option D is unlikely because it suggests that the fire is out of control and spreading rapidly, which is not consistent with the description of a campfire burning brightly in the night. 
  Option A is the most likely completion because it describes the fire as dancing, which is a common way to describe the movement of flames, and suggests that people are watching it flame, which is a common activity around a campfire.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Starting a campfire requires gathering dry wood, kindling, and a fire starter such as matches or a lighter.

  A: This option describes the fire as being watched by people, but it does not provide information about how the fire burns.
  B: This option suggests that the fire is growing in size, which is a likely outcome of a well-tended campfire.
  C: This option describes a specific method for lighting and extinguishing a fire, but it does not provide information about how the fire burns.
  D: This option suggests that the fire is spreading across the ground, which is not a desirable outcome of a campfire.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge:

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?

Choices:
  A: [title] Wash them first if they are caked with mud. [step] Either rinse them with a garden hose or put them through an entire washer cycle.
  B: Shoes could be permanently damaged if dirt and debris are not removed with the help of microbes. Typical finishes of shoes should be white and reasonably soft.

Knowledge:
The description provided in the text is commonly seen in drum corps performances, where a color guard (often consisting of children) performs a choreography behind the marching band. The color guard may also perform a routine on the stage or field.

Explanation:
Option A is unlikely as it describes the kids showing side by side shaking their hands, which is not a common choreography for a color guard. Option C is also unlikely as it describes the kids sitting on the sidewalk looking at them, which is not an active choreography. Option D is also unlikely as it describes the kids wandering around in the street around him walking around, which is not a choreography at all. Option B is the most likely completion as it describes the kids walking down to the stage holding hand stands on the stairs and just standing around, which is a common choreography for a color guard.
Response 2:

Knowledge:
The description suggests that a drum corps is performing on the street. The kids walking in circles behind the band are most likely part of the color guard, which provides visual effects to the performance. The fact that they are walking down to the stage suggests that the performance is part of a larger show or competition, where the drum corps will eventually perform on a stage. 

A: This choice does not fit the context of the description, as it describes kids showing side by side shaking their hands, which is not related to a drum corps performance.
B: This choice fits the context of the description, as it describes kids walking down to the stage holding hand stands on the stairs and just standing around, which is a common occurrence during a drum corps performance.

C: This choice does not fit with the description of the kids' choreography.
D: This choice does not fit with the description of the kids' choreography.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge:
The description of the marching band wearing red uniforms and playing drums with choreography, along with the kids walking in circles doing their own choreography, suggests that this is a description of a drum corps performance. 

A: "show side by side shaking their hands" does not fit the context of a drum corps performance.
B: "walking down to the stage holding hand stands on the stairs and just standing around" is a possible completion to the text, as it describes a common activity during a drum corps performance, where the corps members move from one location to another while performing various visual elements.
C: "are sitting on the sidewalk looking at them" does not fit the context of a drum corps performance.
D: "wandering around in the street around him walking around" does not fit the context of a drum corps performance. 

Therefore, the best answer is B.

A: This choice does not fit the context of the sentence and does not make sense.
B: This choice is the most likely completion to the sentence, as it describes the kids walking down to the stage, holding handstands on the stairs, and standing around, which is a common sight during a drum corps performance.
C: This choice does not fit the context of the sentence and does not make sense.
D: This choice does not fit the context of the sentence and does not make sense. 

Therefore, the best answer is B.

Choice C is possible, but it is less likely than choice B, which describes the children walking down to the stage, holding handstands on the stairs, and standing around.
Choice D does not fit the context of the description, as it describes the children wandering around in the street.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:
  The text describes a scene of a marching band in red uniforms playing drums and doing a choreography on the street. 
  Behind the band, kids walking in circles are doing a choreography.
  A: This option does not fit the context of the text.
  B: This option does not fit the context of the text.
  C: This option is the most likely completion of the text, as it describes the kids sitting on the sidewalk looking at the band.
  D: This option does not fit the context of the text.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

The description of kids walking in circles and doing choreography behind the band suggests that this is a field show performance, which is a type of performance where the marching band performs on a football field or other large outdoor area.

A: "show side by side shaking their hands" does not fit with the context of the description and does not make sense as a completion to the text.
B: "walking down to the stage holding hand stands on the stairs and just standing around" does not fit with the context of the description and does not make sense as a completion to the text.
C: "are sitting on the sidewalk looking at them" fits with the context of the description, but it does not make sense for the kids to be sitting on the sidewalk during a field show performance.
D: "wandering around in the street around him walking around" does not fit with the context of the description and does not make sense as a completion to the text. 

Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is "walking down to the stage holding hand stands on the stairs and just standing around."

B: This choice is also unlikely as the text already describes the man lifting the weight over his head, so there is no need for him to put it down and raise it again.
C: This choice does not make sense as it describes the man lowering his arms and his hands up, which is a contradictory statement.

[header] How to make short legs look longer [title] Wear clothes that fit. [step] Fitted pants and tops that seem custom made for your body will make you look long and lean. If you're petite, shop in the petite section of stores to boost your chances of finding clothes that fit properly.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Baggy and ill-fitting clothes will only make you look frumpy, and will do nothing to lengthen your legs. Avoid buying clothes that don't fit you perfectly.
  B: This is a fine location for height-conscious people to look, but avoid gaudy clothes that show interest in the female genitalia. [title] Accentuate the things that help you look.
  C: [substeps] For instance, if you weigh 13, you should accentuate your body's inner thighs by wearing items high enough so that your thighs are above your hips. If you don't particularly want to highlight your curves, pick short skirts or dresses that fall nicely and that hug your waist without drapes.
  D: Your wardrobe should also remind you that a bit of your figure is confined in all different ways and only when clothing accentuates or constricts these curves you can look the part. [substeps] Wear vertical stripes to make your legs look shorter.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

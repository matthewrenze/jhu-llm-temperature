Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: The sentence describes a campfire burning brightly in the night, which suggests that the fire is already well-established. The phrase "dances" suggests that the flames are flickering and moving, and the phrase "people watch it flame" suggests that there are people present who are enjoying the fire. 

Option B is unlikely because the sentence implies that the fire is already burning brightly, so it is not "slowly growing in size". Option C is unlikely because it describes a specific method of lighting and extinguishing a fire that is not mentioned in the sentence. Option D is unlikely because it describes a fire that is out of control, which is not suggested by the sentence. 

Therefore, the best completion is "dances and people watch it flame," which captures the sense of a well-established fire that is providing entertainment for those around it.

  A campfire is a fire that is set up outdoors, typically in a fire pit or on the ground.
  A: This is a possible completion, but it is not the most likely one, as it does not provide any new information about the campfire.
  B: This is a possible completion, but it does not provide any new information about the campfire.
  C: This completion provides specific details about how the campfire was started and how it will be put out, but it does not describe the campfire itself.

The text states that hair and nails are made up of a protein called keratin and that hair growth has three phases: anagen, catagen, and telogen. The most likely completion to the text is that hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein and that chicken, eggs, and Greek yogurt are great sources of protein. This implies that including protein in your daily diet can help your hair grow faster. Choice A is incorrect because it mentions that each phase has a 5 to 10 percent impact on hair quality, which is not relevant to the question. Choice B is incorrect because it talks about making hair thinner, which is not related to making hair grow faster. Choice D is incorrect because it does not make sense in the context of the text.

Topic: Health
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  The text mentions assessing the color of the plant as a step. Option D provides the most relevant information on how to assess the color of an overwatered plant. It mentions that light green or yellowed leaves, as well as brown new growth, are signs of overwatering. Option A is not relevant to the topic of overwatering, and option C is confusing and does not provide any useful information.

Response 9:
Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

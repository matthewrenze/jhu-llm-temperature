Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.

  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

[header] How to make your hair grow faster [title] Include protein in your daily diet. [step] Your hair and nails are primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Hair growth has three phases: anagen (when hair is growing), catagen (when growth starts to shut down), and telogen (when growth stops and/or the hair falls out).
Choices:
  A: Each phasema has a 5 to 10 percent impact on hair quality. In general, the more protein you consume, the faster your hair growth will begin.
  B: [substeps] Protein is important, both for building and maintaining hair's growth-and making it thinner by increasing the amount of protein your body burns. This will help support your hair's growth.
  C: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.

Topic: Health
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize fear in dogs [title] Look for the whites in a dog's eyes. [step] A dog who's tense or fearful may widen its eyes so that they appear rounder than normal. A relaxed dog often squints so that the eyes become almond-shaped with hardly any whites showing at all.
Choices:

  B: The whites of a dog's eyes may look milky, gray, or bloodshot, or very pale. [substeps] A calm dog generally relaxes when frightened or depressed, and may not retreat from fearful moments.
  C: [substeps] Another characteristic of dogs that are tense or fearful is their pupils. The pupils normally dilate when they are calm or frightened.
  D: If you can see lots of white around a dog's eyes, the dog may be afraid or tense. [substeps] Dilated pupils can also occur when a dog has its eyes widened and is another sign of fear or arousal.

Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is "If you can see lots of white around a dog's eyes, the dog may be afraid or tense. Dilated pupils can also occur when a dog has its eyes widened and is another sign of fear or arousal."
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")

Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
The text is about how to recognize fear in dogs by looking at their eyes. Option D is the most likely completion because it provides additional information that supports the main idea of the text.

Option A is incorrect because it talks about biting and attacking, which is not related to recognizing fear in dogs. Option B is incorrect because it talks about the color of the whites of a dog's eyes, which is not relevant to recognizing fear in dogs. Option C is incorrect because it talks about the dilation of pupils, which is not related to recognizing fear in dogs through the whites of their eyes.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D") 

Knowledge:
  The text is about recognizing fear in dogs.
  The text mentions that when a dog is tense or fearful, it may widen its eyes so that they appear rounder than normal, which makes the whites of their eyes more visible.
  The text also mentions that a relaxed dog often squints so that the eyes become almond-shaped with hardly any whites showing at all.
  Option A talks about dogs exhibiting attacking psychological responses which is not directly related to recognizing fear in dogs.
  Option B talks about the color of a dog's eyes which is not directly related to recognizing fear in dogs.
  Option C talks about another characteristic of dogs that are tense or fearful, but it is unrelated to the whites of a dog's eyes.

Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is Option D, which states that seeing lots of white around a dog's eyes is a sign of fear or tension, and that dilated pupils can also occur when a dog is afraid or aroused. The substeps further explain that dilated pupils are another sign of fear or arousal.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The text mentions that one way to recognize fear in dogs is by looking for the whites in a dog's eyes. The most likely completion to the text is therefore that if you can see lots of white around a dog's eyes, the dog may be afraid or tense. The substeps in choice A and C are not mentioned in the text, and choice B provides information that is not relevant to the topic. Choice D also adds that dilated pupils can be another sign of fear or arousal, which is consistent with the topic.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The text explains how to recognize fear in dogs by looking for the whites in their eyes. Option D is a direct completion of the text, providing additional information about how much white should be visible around a dog's eyes. Option A talks about dogs biting or hiding, which is not related to the topic. Option B talks about the color of the whites of the eyes and a calm dog's reaction, but it does not provide additional information about recognizing fear. Option C talks about the pupils but the text does not mention it. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate completion of the text.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
The text is about how to recognize fear in dogs. The first sentence already gives a clue on how to recognize fear in dogs, which is to look for the whites in a dog's eyes. The second sentence contrasts the appearance of the eyes of a tense or fearful dog with that of a relaxed dog. The most likely completion to this text is D because it expands on how the whites in a dog's eyes can indicate fear or tension in a dog and it also adds information about another sign of fear or arousal in a dog, which is dilated pupils. Options A, B, and C are not related to the topic of recognizing fear in dogs.
Response 9:

  B: This choice suggests that the player missed the goal, but it does not provide any information about what his teammate does.
  C: This choice is a plausible completion as it suggests that the player is trying to keep the ball away from the opponent team player.
  D: This choice is not a plausible completion as it suggests that the player is called a loser, which is not a typical or appropriate response in sports.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Lacrosse is a team sport that involves players using a lacrosse stick to score goals by shooting a small rubber ball into the opposing team's goal.
  The text describes a player from the blue team who is chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  Option A is unlikely because it includes a player named "the sumo," which is not mentioned in the text and is not a common lacrosse term.
  Option B is possible, but the text states that the player is "aggressively" chasing the ball, which suggests that he is not trying to evade it.
  Option D is unlikely because it is not a positive outcome and does not reflect the spirit of teamwork in lacrosse.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Lacrosse is a team sport played with a ball and a long-handled stick. The objective of the game is to score goals by shooting the ball into the opposing team's goal. 
  It is common for players to pass the ball to their teammates in order to create better scoring opportunities.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: The most likely completion to the text is that the player passes to another teammate, the teammate scores a goal, and the blue team celebrates. The text indicates that the player is trying to hit a goal, which suggests that they are attempting to shoot the ball towards the goal. However, the use of the phrase "his team member" suggests that the player is not successful in scoring the goal, and instead passes the ball to a teammate who is able to score. The use of the phrase "the blue team comes out of their seats" further supports the idea that a goal has been scored by the blue team.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Lacrosse is a sport that involves using a stick with a netted head to catch, carry, and pass a small rubber ball. 
  The objective of the game is to score by shooting the ball into the opponent's goal.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes a player from the blue team trying to hit a goal with his lacrosse stick. 
  Option A: This option is not likely because it mentions a "sumo," which is not relevant to the passage. Also, it does not describe the outcome for the blue team's goal attempt.
  Option B: This option is not likely because it describes the player missing the goal by two feet, which contradicts the statement that the player is trying to hit the goal.
  Option C: This option is likely because it describes the player trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, which is a common strategy in lacrosse.
  Option D: This option is not likely because it describes the player failing and being called a loser, which is not a positive outcome for the blue team's goal attempt.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Lacrosse is a team sport that involves players using a lacrosse stick to pass and catch a ball in order to score goals.
  There are two teams, each with different colored jerseys.
  The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team.
  Teammates work together to pass the ball and create scoring opportunities.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
The most likely completion to the text is "tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player." as it is common for a player to try to keep the ball in possession of their team and away from the opposing team.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Lacrosse is a team sport played with a ball and a long-handled stick called a crosse or lacrosse stick. 
  The objective of the game is to use the lacrosse stick to catch, carry, and pass the ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling the ball into the opponent's goal. 
  The blue team member is chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal. 
  The options A and D do not make sense in the context of the game. 
  Option B suggests that the player misses the goal, but it does not explain what happens next. 
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, the most likely completion is that the blue team member tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.

Option B: The text describes the player trying to hit the goal, not avoiding it.
Option C: This option is consistent with the objective of the game and the player's behavior.
Option D: This option is not a likely outcome of a player's first attempt to hit the goal.

Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Lacrosse is a team sport played with a ball and a long-handled stick called a crosse.

### Exam: hellaswag_val-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

[header] How to apply eyeliner to small round eyes [title] Apply a light-colored eyeliner to your waterline. [step] Use a white or nude colored eyeliner for the best results. Light colors will open and brighten your eyes so they look bigger.
Choices:
  A: You will need to apply the eyeliner in this color to begin with. Then, move on to your waterline and then your eyelid.
  B: Focus on your waterline when working with eyeliner. [substeps] For more precise eye work, get a small eye brush (such as a toothpick, eyebrow brush, or electric wand), and water that goes with eyeliner on smaller, streaky areas.
  C: [substeps] Apply a softer line of eyeliner on your waterline for a more natural look. Avoid applying eyeliner all the way across your waterline if you have close-set eyes, as this will make them appear closer together.
  D: [substeps] Only use white eyeliner for brown eyes. Otherwise, the eyeliner won't pop as much and will sink into your eyebrows and make your eyes look round.

[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

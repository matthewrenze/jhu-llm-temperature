Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.

  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.

Choice D is unlikely, as a campfire that rapidly spreads across the ground would be dangerous and difficult to control.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: 
  A campfire, once lit, will burn brightly in the night and the flames will dance.
  B: A campfire may grow in size, but it is not the most likely completion to the given text.
  C: The instruction for lighting and extinguishing a fire with an iron grill is not relevant to the given text.
  D: A campfire should not rapidly spread across the ground, as that would be dangerous.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: The sentence describes a campfire that is already burning brightly at night. The phrase "burns brightly" implies that the fire is already fully established. The phrase "the fire" suggests that the sentence is describing the fire that is already burning. Option A is the most likely completion because it describes people watching the flames of an already established fire. Option B is unlikely because the fire is already established and burning brightly. Option C is unlikely because the sentence does not mention an iron grill or lighting the fire from the inside up. Option D is unlikely because it suggests the fire is out of control.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: 
  The sentence describes a camp fire burning brightly in the night, implying that the fire is already burning.
  A: The most fitting completion to the sentence is that the fire dances and people watch it flame.
  B: This option is not compatible with the initial sentence because it describes the fire growing in size, which is not mentioned as happening after the initial description.
  C: This option describes a specific way of lighting and putting out a fire, but it is not mentioned in the initial sentence.
  D: This option is not compatible with the initial sentence because it describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which would be dangerous and not desirable in a campfire.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge:
  A campfire is a fire that is lit in the outdoors, typically at a campground or while camping.
  The text mentions "A camp fire burns brightly in the night" and "the fire", which implies that the text is likely describing the appearance of an established campfire.
  B: The text does not mention the size of the fire growing.
  C: The text does not mention the fire being lit from the inside up or put out behind an iron grill.
  D: The text does not imply that the fire is spreading rapidly across the ground. 
  A: The text mentions "burns brightly" and "dances", which suggests that people are watching the fire flame. 
Therefore, the most likely completion is "dances and people watch it flame."
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Starting a campfire requires kindling, such as small twigs, dry leaves, or small pieces of wood, and then adding larger pieces of wood.
  The fire should be started in a safe area, such as a fire pit or a cleared area that is free from overhanging branches and other flammable materials.
  A: This choice describes the behavior of the fire after it has been started, but it does not provide information on how to start the fire.
  B: This choice implies that the fire has already been started and is now growing in size, but it does not provide information on how to start the fire.
  C: This choice provides some information on how to start and put out a campfire, but it describes a specific method that may not be applicable in all situations.
  D: This choice describes a dangerous situation where the fire is spreading out of control, which should be avoided when starting a campfire.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: 
  When a campfire gets going, it usually burns brightly and people often watch the flames as they dance. 
  Option B is unlikely, since a campfire is usually started with smaller twigs and sticks that eventually build up to a larger fire. 
  Option C may be true for certain types of campfires, such as those in a fire pit with an iron grill, but it is not a general rule. 
  Option D is incorrect and dangerous, as it would indicate an uncontrolled fire that could cause harm. 
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge:
  The text describes a campfire burning brightly in the night. 
  A: The fire dancing and people watching it flame is a common image associated with campfires.
  B: Slow growth in size is not usually a characteristic of a campfire.
  C: Lighting the fire from the inside and putting it out behind an iron grill is a way to safely start and put out a campfire, but it does not complete the description of the fire burning brightly in the night.
  D: Rapid spread across the ground is not a desirable characteristic of a campfire and it can be dangerous.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: The statement describes a campfire burning brightly in the night, which implies that the fire is already well-established and has been burning for some time. The phrase "the fire dances" suggests that the flames are flickering and moving, which is a common characteristic of a campfire. The phrase "and people watch it flame" is a natural and logical completion to the sentence, as people often gather around a campfire to watch the flames and enjoy the warmth. 
A: "dances and people watch it flame" is the most likely completion to the sentence.
B: "slowly grows in size" is not a likely completion, as the fire is already described as burning brightly.
C: "is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill" is not a likely completion, as it describes a specific method of starting and extinguishing a fire, rather than the current state of the fire.
D: "rapidly spreads across the ground" is not a likely completion, as it suggests an uncontrolled fire, which is not the case with a campfire.

A: This is the correct completion and accurately describes the clean and jerk technique.
B: This is not the correct completion as the lifter should complete the jerk portion of the clean and jerk after lifting the weight to the shoulders.
C: This is not the correct completion as the lifter should not slam the weight against the wall during a clean and jerk.
D: This is not the correct completion as the lifter should complete the jerk portion of the clean and jerk after lifting the weight to the shoulders.

The description matches the first part of the clean and jerk weightlifting movement, where the lifter bends down, picks up the weight from the ground, and lifts it above their head in a quick motion while jumping their feet apart. Therefore, the most likely completion of the text is "lifts up above his head and jumps his feet apart."
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The description matches the initial stage of a clean and jerk weightlifting move.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The text is about how to give yourself a Brazilian wax.
  The previous step was to buy a good sugaring wax, which is generally available at most large retail stores or beauty supply stores.
  Nair roll-on wax is a good choice because it has a roll-on applicator that dispenses an even amount of wax over the surface.

Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: None of the options is an appropriate completion to the text. However, option B is the most incorrect and irrelevant one, so it is the most likely answer. The correct step would be to apply the wax to a small area of hair and then apply a wax strip over the wax. The strip is then quickly pulled off in the opposite direction of hair growth.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The text is about giving yourself a Brazilian wax.
  The first step is to buy a good sugaring wax and it is recommended to use a roll-on wax.
Choice:

Choice B is incorrect because it talks about applying the wax to the hair and turning it around, which is not a recommended method for Brazilian waxing.
Choice C is incorrect because it talks about starting on the mid-hair and removing the wax, which is not the correct procedure for Brazilian waxing.
Choice D is incorrect because it talks about purchasing many things, but it does not relate to the topic of Brazilian waxing.

Choices:
  A: [title] Wash them first if they are caked with mud. [step] Either rinse them with a garden hose or put them through an entire washer cycle.
  B: Shoes could be permanently damaged if dirt and debris are not removed with the help of microbes. Typical finishes of shoes should be white and reasonably soft.
  C: Of course, if they aren't synthetic, place them into the washing machine with the proper temperature. [substeps] Avoid using steel wool or other aggressively abrasive laers, as these can damage the rubber soles of a properly-made pair of shoes.

  The description of a marching band wearing red uniforms playing drums and doing a choreography, along with kids walking in circles doing a choreography, suggests a scene from a drum corps performance. 
  A: The phrase "show side by side shaking their hands" does not fit the context of the scene described. 
  B: The phrase "walking down to the stage holding hand stands on the stairs and just standing around" is a possible description of the movement of the drum corps as they move from one formation to another during the performance.

  D: The phrase "wandering around in the street around him walking around" does not fit the context of the scene described.
Response 2:

A: This choice seems unlikely as it would be dangerous and is not a typical result of weightlifting training. 
B: This choice is possible, but it doesn't really complete the sentence in a meaningful way. 
C: This choice doesn't make sense as it describes lowering arms and hands up which is contradictory.

Action: Answer("D")

  B: This option is possible, but it does not mention the name of the weightlifting technique used. 
  C: This option is unlikely as the body builders falling does not match with the context of weightlifting.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes a body builder lifting a weight bar several times and then dropping it down while the other two body builders watch him. 
  The term "clean and jerk" refers to a weightlifting movement in which a barbell is lifted from the ground to the shoulders in one motion (the clean) and then lifted overhead (the jerk).
  
  A: The completion of wiping off sweat with a towel seems unlikely and the text does not mention the body builder doing this.
  B: The completion of releasing the weight bar and beam seems unlikely and is not mentioned in the text.
  C: The completion of the body builders falling seems unlikely and the text does not mention the body builders falling.
  D: The completion of the body builder running towards the weight and the others falling seems unlikely and is not mentioned in the text.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes a weightlifting exercise called the clean and jerk.
  The lifter lifts the weight bar to shoulder level, then jerks it overhead to arm's length.
  The lift involves two distinct phases: the clean, which brings the weight to shoulder level, and the jerk, which lifts the weight overhead.
  The text mentions dropping the weight bar, which is a common practice after completing a lift.
  A: The text does not mention the lifter wiping off sweat or lifting the weight bar again.
  B: This choice describes the lifter dropping the weight bar and the beam he was holding, but the text does not mention the lifter holding a beam.
  C: This choice describes the lifter continuing to lift for a couple of seconds, which is not part of the clean and jerk exercise.
  D: This choice is not related to the text and does not describe a possible completion to the text.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The description mentions body builders, a weight bar, and dropping the bar down. The term "clean and jerk" is not explicitly mentioned, but it is a weightlifting exercise that involves lifting a weight bar from the ground to the shoulders and then overhead.
  A: This choice is not likely because the text mentions that the body builder drops the weight bar down, so it is unlikely that he would wipe off his sweat and then lift the bar again.
  B: This choice is not likely because it mentions that the body builder drops the beam he was holding, which is not mentioned in the text.
  C: This choice is not likely because it mentions that the body builders fall, which is not mentioned in the text and does not make sense in the context of weightlifting.
  D: This choice is not likely because it mentions that the body builders fall with the weight, which is not mentioned in the text and does not make sense in the context of weightlifting.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The text is describing a weightlifting exercise called the "clean and jerk" where the lifter lifts the weight above their head and then drops it down.
  A: This option includes wiping off sweat with a towel, which is not mentioned in the text and is unlikely to happen during a weightlifting exercise.
  B: This option includes the lifter releasing both the weight bar and a beam, which is not mentioned in the text and seems unlikely to happen during a weightlifting exercise.
  C: This option suggests that the body builders fall, which is not mentioned in the text and does not make sense in the context of a weightlifting exercise.
  D: This option suggests that the lifter drops down, which is not mentioned in the text and does not make sense in the context of a weightlifting exercise.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes a weightlifting exercise called "clean and jerk" in which the lifter lifts the weight bar and then drops it down.
  A: This choice includes wiping off sweat, but there is no indication that the lifter did so in the text. Also, the text does not mention lifting the weight bar again after dropping it.
  B: This choice describes the lifter releasing both the weight bar and a beam, but there is no indication in the text that the lifter was holding a beam. 
  C: This choice suggests that the lifter continues to lift the weight bar for another couple of seconds, which is unlikely because the clean and jerk is typically completed in a matter of seconds. Also, the choice mentions the body builders falling, but there is no indication in the text that they fell.
  D: This choice describes the lifter running towards the weight as the others fall with the weight and watch him drop down, which is not consistent with what is described in the text. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes a weightlifting movement called the clean and jerk.
  The clean and jerk involves lifting a weight bar to the shoulders and then lifting it overhead.

Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

### Exam: hellaswag_val-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

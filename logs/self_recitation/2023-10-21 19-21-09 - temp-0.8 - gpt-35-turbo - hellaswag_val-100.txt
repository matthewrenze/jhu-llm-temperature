Topic: Family Life
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

  B: slowly grows in size.
  C: is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill.
  D: rapidly spreads across the ground.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge:
The phrase "burns brightly in the night" suggests that the fire is already lit and well-established. Option B ("slowly grows in size") and Option D ("rapidly spreads across the ground") both suggest that the fire is in the process of growing or spreading, which is not consistent with the initial description. Option C ("is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill") does not make sense in the context of the original text. Option A ("dances and people watch it flame") is the most likely completion, as it suggests that the fire is burning steadily and people are enjoying watching it.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  When starting a campfire, it is important to control the flames and prevent it from spreading uncontrollably. 
  A: This option describes a possible scenario, but it does not provide guidance on how to start a campfire. 
  B: This option also does not provide guidance on how to start a campfire, but it could describe how a campfire grows after it has been started. 
  C: This option provides guidance on how to start and extinguish a campfire safely. 
  D: This option describes a dangerous situation that should be avoided when starting a campfire. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge:
   The context of the text is talking about a campfire burning brightly in the night. 
   A: "dances and people watch it flame" is a likely completion because campfires often have flames that move or flicker and people often enjoy watching them. 
   B: "slowly grows in size" could be a possible completion, but it doesn't fit as well with the description of a fire that is already burning brightly in the night.
   C: "is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill" is not a likely completion because it describes the process of starting and extinguishing a fire, rather than what is happening while the fire is burning.
   D: "rapidly spreads across the ground" is not a likely completion because it describes a out-of-control fire, rather than a controlled campfire.
Response 3:
Knowledge: Starting and maintaining a campfire requires certain steps and precautions to ensure safety and minimize environmental impact. 
A: This choice describes people watching flames, but does not provide information on how the campfire was started or maintained.
B: This choice provides a logical continuation, as the fire will typically grow in size as more wood is added.
C: This choice provides information on how the fire was started and how it will be put out, but does not describe the current state of the campfire.
D: This choice describes a dangerous situation where the fire is out of control and spreading rapidly, which is not a desirable outcome.

Action: Answer("B")

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is typically started by lighting kindling and gradually adding larger pieces of wood to the fire until it reaches the desired size.
  A: This option is possible, but it doesn't complete the sentence appropriately.
  B: This option is possible, but it doesn't complete the sentence appropriately.
  C: This option doesn't make sense as it describes how to put out a fire rather than how it burns.
  D: This option is unlikely and not safe as a campfire should never rapidly spread across the ground.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Starting a campfire requires gathering materials such as dry wood, kindling, and fire starters.
  Once the fire is started, it needs to be tended to with care to prevent it from getting out of control.
  A: This option describes people watching the fire and the way it moves, but it does not provide information about the fire itself.
  B: This option suggests that the fire is getting bigger, which is a possibility after it is initially started.
  C: This option describes a specific method for lighting and putting out a fire, but it does not provide information about the fire itself.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  A campfire is a fire that is contained and maintained for outdoor recreational activities.

  C: This option describes a specific method of starting and putting out a campfire, but it does not complete the given text.
  D: This option is not the most likely completion to the given text because a campfire that rapidly spreads across the ground is dangerous and not contained.

Hair growth has three phases: anagen (when hair is growing), catagen (when growth starts to shut down), and telogen (when growth stops and/or the hair falls out).
Choices:
  A: Each phasema has a 5 to 10 percent impact on hair quality. In general, the more protein you consume, the faster your hair growth will begin.
  B: [substeps] Protein is important, both for building and maintaining hair's growth-and making it thinner by increasing the amount of protein your body burns. This will help support your hair's growth.
  C: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.

  The text is about getting a cute summer hairstyle.
  The first step is to prep your hair in the shower with shampoo and conditioner, and then dry your hair with a towel.
  The next step is to blow-dry your hair until it is completely dry, using cool air to seal the cuticle and add shine.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.

[substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize fear in dogs [title] Look for the whites in a dog's eyes. [step] A dog who's tense or fearful may widen its eyes so that they appear rounder than normal. A relaxed dog often squints so that the eyes become almond-shaped with hardly any whites showing at all.
Choices:

  B: The whites of a dog's eyes may look milky, gray, or bloodshot, or very pale. [substeps] A calm dog generally relaxes when frightened or depressed, and may not retreat from fearful moments.
  C: [substeps] Another characteristic of dogs that are tense or fearful is their pupils. The pupils normally dilate when they are calm or frightened.
  D: If you can see lots of white around a dog's eyes, the dog may be afraid or tense. [substeps] Dilated pupils can also occur when a dog has its eyes widened and is another sign of fear or arousal.

  D: This completion expands on the information provided in the text about how to recognize fear in dogs through their eyes. It explains that if a person can see lots of white around a dog's eyes, the dog may be afraid or tense, and that dilated pupils can also occur when a dog is fearful or aroused. It is the most likely completion to the given text.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")

Knowledge:
The text talks about how to recognize fear in dogs. It mentions that when you can see lots of white around a dog's eyes, the dog may be afraid or tense. It then goes on to say that dilated pupils can also occur when a dog has its eyes widened and is another sign of fear or arousal.

A: This completion does not add any more information to the text. Instead, it talks about different ways in which dogs may exhibit fear, but this is not related to the content in the original text.
B: This completion provides some additional information about the appearance of a dog's eyes, but it does not explain what it means when the whites of a dog's eyes are visible. It also talks about a calm dog, which is not relevant to the topic.
C: This completion talks about another characteristic of dogs that are tense or fearful, but it does not complete the information provided in the original text about how to recognize fear in dogs.

Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is D, which explains that if you can see lots of white around a dog's eyes, the dog may be afraid or tense. It also adds that dilated pupils can occur when a dog has its eyes widened and is another sign of fear or arousal.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
The text explains how to recognize fear in dogs by looking at their eyes. The most likely completion to the text is that if someone can see a lot of white in a dog's eyes, the dog may be fearful or tense. This is because dogs who are tense or fearful may widen their eyes so that they appear rounder than normal and show more of the whites of their eyes. The substeps in option D also provide additional information on another sign of fear or arousal in dogs, which is dilated pupils. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")

This completion fits with the context of the description of a drum corps performance, where performers often march and perform choreography while playing their instruments, and where color guard members may walk or dance in formation around the performers.

  Option D does not make sense as it refers to a calf being released, which is not relevant to ice fishing.
Action: Answer("C")  
The most likely completion to the text is that others are kneeling around the person as he continues to reel.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The question is related to a visual scenario that can not be directly seen through text. However, there are common practices in ice fishing that can be taken into consideration.

  C: Kneeling around the person reeling in the fish is a common practice in ice fishing where people gather around to help or watch the catch. 
  D: The text mentions nothing about a calf, so this is not a likely completion. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Ice fishing is a type of fishing that involves fishing through a hole in the ice.
  The completion should be related to ice fishing and what other people are doing while one person is reeling in a fish.

Option B: It states that people are mostly off in the water followed by more people reeling the fishing pole in, but this does not accurately describe the activity in ice fishing.
Option C: This option describes people kneeling around the person as he continues to reel, which is a plausible scenario in ice fishing where people could gather around the hole to watch and help.
Option D: This option describes people watching a calf being released, which is not related to ice fishing.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Ice fishing is a popular activity in colder regions where a hole is made in the ice to fish during winter months.

  Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:

  D: The text does not mention the body builder running towards the weight or the others falling with the weight.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The question is about body builders lifting a weight bar, which sounds like the weightlifting sport.
  In weightlifting, the Clean and Jerk is a two-part lift where the athlete lifts the bar to their shoulders (Clean) and then lifts it overhead (Jerk).
  The question describes one body builder lifting the weight bar several times.
  The options contain different actions that this body builder could take after lifting and dropping the bar.
 
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  Option A seems to be the most likely completion of the text. After lifting and dropping the weight bar, it is reasonable to assume that the body builder would take a break and wipe off his sweat with a towel before lifting the weight bar again.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Clean and jerk is an Olympic weightlifting event that involves lifting a barbell from the ground to overhead in two movements: clean and jerk.
  
Analysis:
  The text describes a bodybuilder lifting a weight bar several times and then dropping it down, while two other bodybuilders watch. This action matches the motion of a clean and jerk, where the athlete lifts the weight bar from the ground to shoulder height and then jerks it overhead. Therefore, it is likely that the bodybuilder was performing a clean and jerk and dropped the weight bar after finishing the set.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The clean and jerk is a weightlifting exercise in which a barbell is lifted from the ground to the shoulders in one motion, and then lifted overhead in a second motion.

  B: Women covering their cleavage can wear any type of chest bra. Start with a bra with a padded band, and expand as needed so that it covers your breasts.
  C: These bras are solid, have a fastening point, and have lots of support under your bra and around your waist. Depending on the material, these bras may cost at least £ 500 or more.

Response 0:
Knowledge: The text mentions a woman who is holding a white paper and is wearing an orange and red dress. There are flashing words that appear on the screen.

Action: Answer("B") 
The most likely completion to the text is "appear after the woman is talking and continues to the end." This makes the most sense since the flashing words appear while the woman is still talking, and they continue until the end.
Response 1:
Knowledge: The given text talks about a woman who appears for the second time and is still holding a white paper while talking. The text mentions the flashing words, but it's not clear what those words are about.

Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the given information, it seems most likely that the flashing words appear after the woman is talking and continue to the end. This would suggest that the woman's dialogue is uninterrupted by the flashing words and that they continue throughout the conclusion of the text. Option B is therefore the most appropriate completion of the text.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The text mentions a woman dressed in an orange and red dress holding a white paper as she talks.
  A: This choice does not seem to be related to the context mentioned in the text.
  B: This choice is possible as it suggests that the flashing words appear after the woman starts talking and continues to the end.
  C: This choice does not seem to make sense as it is unclear what "at the bottom" and the X symbol refer to.
  D: This choice does not seem to be related to the context mentioned in the text.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The question is about a woman dressed in an orange and red dress who is holding a white paper and talking. There are flashing words mentioned.
A: The choice A doesn't make sense in the context of the text. There is nothing to suggest that the flashing words are related to starting something.
B: The flashing words are mentioned while the woman is still talking. Therefore, choice B is possible.
C: The choice C doesn't make sense in the context of the text. There is nothing to suggest that the woman puts the white paper in anything or makes an x below it.
D: The choice D doesn't make sense in the context of the text. There is nothing to suggest that the flashing words are saying "curt's theme comedy" or that they are attached to a fedex limit tape.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The given text is describing a woman holding a white paper who appears again while still talking in the presence of flashing words.
  A: This choice talks about an announcement to start, but it does not seem to be relevant to the given text.

  D: This choice talks about a theme comedy enacted with a Fedex limit tape, which is not relevant to the given text.

  C: This option suggests that the words are at the bottom of the white paper and the woman marks an x below them.
  D: This option is unrelated to the passage and does not provide a suitable completion to the text.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

The text suggests that the woman is still holding the white paper as she talks, implying that she is speaking during the time frame mentioned. Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the flashing words appear after the woman is talking and continues until the end. Choice B is the only option that fits this scenario. Choices A, C, and D are irrelevant and do not make sense in the context of the text.
Response 9:

Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

  B: Barbecue foods should be kept on medium-low to high heat, as these are advised by your local cook guide. [substeps] It's not necessary to have added meat or other food when making your links.
  C: You can also melt some light coals and brown them in just a few minutes. Wait until the coals are not glowing, or they're just starting to brown.
  D: Dump the coals onto one half of the grill grate. [title] Arrange the hot links on the grill.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The first sentence indicates that the text will provide instructions on how to cook hot links. The second sentence provides the first step which is to preheat a grill. The third sentence gives instructions on how to heat the grill based on the type of grill being used. Choice D is the most likely completion because it provides the next logical step, which is to arrange the hot links on the grill.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The text provides instructions on how to cook hot links in a grill.
  A: The completion does not provide appropriate instructions for cooking hot links.
  B: The completion provides irrelevant information and instructions for cooking hot links.
  C: The completion provides instructions for cooking hot links on coals, which is not mentioned as an option in the text.
  D: The completion provides an appropriate next step for cooking hot links on a preheated grill.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:

  A: This option does not provide a relevant continuation on how to cook hot links.
  B: This option provides some advice, but not specific instructions on how to cook hot links.
  C: This option suggests an alternative way to cook hot links, but it does not continue the original set of instructions provided.
  D: This option continues with the next step on how to cook hot links, which is to arrange them on the grill.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The text provides instructions on how to cook hot links on a grill. 
  A: This choice introduces a new topic not related to the text, and it doesn't complete the instructions.
  B: This choice also introduces a new topic that is not related to the text, and it doesn't complete the instructions.
  C: This choice provides instructions that are not consistent with the previous step of heating the briquettes until they are hot and ashy. It doesn't complete the instructions either.
  D: This choice is consistent with the previous step of heating the grill, and it provides the next step of arranging the hot links on the grill. This choice completes the instructions on how to cook hot links.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
The text is about how to cook hot links on a grill and it gives the instruction to preheat the grill. 
The next step is to turn on the gas grill to medium-low heat or heat the briquettes until they're hot and ashy if using a charcoal grill. 
Since there is no mention of the need to wait for anything to happen, option A is not the correct answer. 
Option B contains irrelevant and misleading information and is therefore not the correct answer. 
Option C talks about melting some light coals and browning them, which is not related to the instructions given in the text. 
Option D is the correct answer because it provides the next logical step for cooking hot links, which is to dump the coals onto one half of the grill grate and arrange the hot links on the grill.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
The previous text explains the first steps to cook hot links. The next step should be related to the actual cooking of the hot links. Option D is the only one that is logically related to the previous text and provides a clear direction on what to do next. Option A talks about waiting for the grill to come to full temperature, which is redundant and not necessary given the previous step of heating the grill. Option B is unrelated to the topic and presents incorrect information. Option C mentions coals, which are not mentioned in the previous text.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
The text is explaining how to cook hot links, and it has already given the instruction to preheat a grill. The next logical step is to arrange the hot links on the grill after dumping the coals on one half of the grill grate. Option D is the only choice that mentions arranging the hot links on the grill.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The text provides instructions on how to cook hot links on a grill. 
  A: The text mentions preheating the grill and gives initial instructions to heat the grill to medium-low, but it does not provide any further information on what to do if there is steam rising or if the grill is not at full temperature.
  B: The text talks about heating the grill to medium-low but does not mention anything about using a local cook guide or adding other food. The part about it not being necessary to add other food may be interpreted as a substep, but it is not explicitly labeled as such.
  C: The text mentions melting some light coals and browning them, but it does not provide any clear instructions on how to do this or how long to wait until the coals are ready.
  D: The text provides instructions to dump the coals onto one half of the grill grate and to arrange the hot links on the grill.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
The given steps provide instructions on how to cook hot links. Preheat the grill and heat the briquettes, then the most likely completion of the text is to continue with the next step of cooking the hot links.

Response 9:
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  The header states that the text is about how to cook hot links, and the first step is to preheat the grill.

Choices:
  A: This will help you provide a good, continuous record of his up-to-the-minute habits. [substeps] You might record breakfast, lunch, and snack times.
  B: [substeps] For instance, if your child wakes up about an hour before naptime, have them break out his ready-made lunch so they can have enough time to eat before naptime. If your child usually wakes up hours before naptime, try a more gradual recording of their wake time.
  C: Note what time your child goes to bed, what time they wake up, and any naps they take during the day. You should try to identify any patterns in your child's sleep, and if noise, hunger, light or too many naps during the day are causing the early wake time.
  D: [substeps] Look on your child's waking times and things they engage in during the day and other times they wake up. You might note bedtimes, work/school times, break-ins, or other times that your child felt awake immediately.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The paragraph is discussing how to keep children from waking up too early, and suggests identifying possible reasons for a toddler's early wake time by keeping track of their sleeping habits for one to two weeks. The most likely completion is choice C, as it explains what should be kept on record during this time, including bedtime, wake-up time, and naps, and advises identifying patterns in the child's sleep to determine the cause of early wake-up times.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
The text is discussing ways to prevent toddlers from waking up too early, and the step provided is to keep a record of the child's sleeping habits. Option C is the most relevant as it offers specific guidance on what to record and what patterns to look for. Options A, B, and D are not relevant to the given step or to the topic of the text.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")  
The completion that best fits the text is "Note what time your child goes to bed, what time they wake up, and any naps they take during the day. You should try to identify any patterns in your child's sleep, and if noise, hunger, light or too many naps during the day are causing the early wake time." This completion fits well with the given header, title, and step, and provides the information needed to identify possible reasons for a toddler's early wake time.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
The completion that best fits the text is C. The text explains how to keep children from waking up too early by identifying possible reasons for the early wake time, such as noise, hunger, or light. The article then suggests keeping a record of the child's sleeping habits, including bedtimes, wake-up times, and any naps they take during the day. The purpose of keeping this record is to help identify patterns and possible causes of the early wake time. Choice A is not relevant to the text and choice B talks about preparing lunch before nap time which is not relevant to the text. Choice D is not making sense and it is not relevant to the text.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: The text is discussing how to keep children from waking up too early and provides a step to identify possible reasons for a toddler's early wake time.

The choices discuss different ways of keeping a record or addressing the child's early wake time. Only choice C is consistent with the step provided in the text, and it gives specific instructions for what the reader should record.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
The completion of the text should provide a step-by-step guide to identify possible reasons for a toddler's early wake time. Choice A talks about recording breakfast, lunch, and snack times, but it doesn't address the issue of early wake time. Choice B talks about preparing lunch for a child who wakes up an hour before naptime, but it doesn't provide a general solution for early wake time. Choice D talks about noting waking times and activities, but it doesn't provide any guidance on how to identify reasons for early wake time. Choice C is the best completion because it provides a clear step on how to identify possible reasons for a toddler's early wake time by keeping records of the child's sleeping habits for one to two weeks and looking for patterns in their sleep, and identifying if noise, hunger, light or too many naps during the day are causing early wake time.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: The paragraph explains that one should identify possible reasons for the toddler's early wake time. The paragraph then suggests keeping a record of the child's sleeping habits for one to two weeks.

None of the other options match the context of the paragraph.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")

  The text talks about identifying possible reasons for a toddler's early wake time by keeping a record of their sleeping habits and provides examples of such reasons including noise, hunger, and light. The text then suggests keeping a record of the child's sleeping habits for one to two weeks, which implies that one should note down the time the child goes to bed, what time they wake up, and any naps they take during the day. The text also suggests identifying any patterns in the child's sleep and if noise, hunger, light, or too many naps during the day are causing the early wake time. Among the choices, only option C provides a completion that is consistent with the context of the text.
Response 8:

As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.

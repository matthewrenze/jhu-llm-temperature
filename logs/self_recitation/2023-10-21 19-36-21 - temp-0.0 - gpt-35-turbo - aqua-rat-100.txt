### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. 

Knowledge:
- 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation.
- 40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations.
- 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation.
- We want to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

To find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we need to subtract the number of employees who take both vacations from the number of employees who take only a summer vacation.

The number of employees who take only a summer vacation can be found by subtracting the number of employees who take both vacations from the number of employees who take a summer vacation:
Summer vacation only = Total summer vacation - Both vacations
Summer vacation only = (100-Q)% - 40%

We know that 20% of the employees take neither vacation, so the percentage of employees who take at least one vacation is:
100% - 20% = 80%

We also know that 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, and 40% take both vacations. This means that the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation is:
80% - 75% + 40% = 45%

Now we can substitute the value of the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation into the equation for Summer vacation only:
Summer vacation only = (100-Q)% - 40%
Summer vacation only = 45% - 40%
Summer vacation only = 5%

Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere?
Choices:
  A:  13.3542
  B:  15.8113
  C:  18.3451
  D:  19.5667
  E:  20.8888
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  A rectangular solid has 8 vertices.
  The diameter of a sphere is twice the radius of the sphere.
  The radius of the sphere is the distance from the center of the sphere to any point on the sphere.
  The longest diagonal of the rectangular solid is the diameter of the sphere.
  The longest diagonal of a rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
  The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle with legs of length a and b and hypotenuse of length c, a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
  The longest diagonal of the rectangular solid can be found by applying the Pythagorean theorem twice.
  The longest diagonal of the rectangular solid is sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(250).
  The diameter of the sphere is twice the radius of the sphere, which is equal to half the length of the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid.
  Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 2 * sqrt(250) / 2 = sqrt(250).

Topic: Math
Question: John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made?
Choices:
  A: 1,980
  B: 2,020
  C: 2,100
  D: 2,200
  E: 1,900
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are 5 vowels and 20 consonants.
  The middle letter must be a vowel.
  The first and third letters must be different from each other and both consonants.
  We can choose the first and third letters in 20 * 19 ways.
  We can choose the middle letter in 5 ways.
  We can choose the first and third letters in 18 * 17 ways if we exclude the 2 letters that were chosen for the first and third letters.
  The total number of codes is the product of the number of ways to choose the first and third letters, and the number of ways to choose the middle letter.
  Therefore, the total number of codes is 20 * 19 * 5 * 18 * 17 = 1,938,600.

Topic: Math
Question: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?

  A: 4,000
  B: 4,200
  C: 4,500
  D: 4,800
  E: 5,000
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Let's assume that the total number of staplers produced on Monday is "x".
  10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so the number of defective staplers is 0.1x.
  The remaining staplers are non-defective, so the number of non-defective staplers is 0.9x.
  2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of rejected non-defective staplers is 0.02 * 0.9x = 0.018x.
  We know that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, so 0.018x = 72.

Topic: Math
Question: M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift?
Choices:
  A: D/(M-3)
  B: MD/3
  C: M/(D-3)
  D: 3D/(M2-3M)
  E: None of these
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Initially, M men agreed to purchase a gift for Rs. D.
  If 3 men drop out, then there will be M-3 men left to purchase the gift.
  Each person's contribution will increase because there are fewer people to share the cost.
  Therefore, the answer should be greater than D/M.

Calculations:
  Initially, each person would contribute D/M.
  After 3 men drop out, each person would have to contribute (D/(M-3)).
  The difference is (D/(M-3)) - (D/M) = 3D/(M^2-3M).

Question: My wall contains 8 red colour ties, 13 violet colour ties,10 blue colour ties, 5 pink colour ties, 4 green colour ties. If electricity is gone and I want at least two ties of same colour then how many ties I should take out from my rack?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
  E: 6
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  To ensure that at least two ties are of the same color, we need to apply the Pigeonhole Principle. This principle states that if we have n items to put into m containers, and n > m, then there must be at least one container with more than one item.
  We have 5 different colors of ties, and the total number of ties is 8+13+10+5+4 = 40.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  We need to take out ties until we have at least two ties of the same color. The worst-case scenario is that we take out one tie of each color, which would give us a total of 5 ties. However, if we take out one more tie, we are guaranteed to have at least two ties of the same color. Therefore, we need to take out 4 ties.

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If events A and B are independent, then the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).
  The probability of at least one of two events occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability of both events occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).
  We can use these formulas to solve the problem.
  
Solution:
  Let's use the formula for P(A or B) to find the probability of event B occurring:
  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
  We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96, so we can plug in these values and solve for P(B):
  0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))
  0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
  0.36 = 0.4P(B)
  P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4
  P(B) = 0.9

  The time it takes for a ball to make one full rotation is the period of rotation.
  The period of rotation is the inverse of the frequency of rotation.
  The frequency of rotation is the number of full rotations per unit time.
  The balls will be at the same starting point again when they complete an integer number of full rotations.
  The period of rotation of ball A is 13 minutes.
  The frequency of rotation of ball A is 1/13 rotations per minute.
  The period of rotation of ball B is 7 minutes.
  The frequency of rotation of ball B is 5/7 rotations per minute.
  The balls will be at the same starting point again when the number of full rotations of ball A is equal to the number of full rotations of ball B plus an integer number of full rotations.
  Let t be the time it takes for the balls to be at the same starting point again.
  Then, the number of full rotations of ball A is 2t/13, and the number of full rotations of ball B is 5t/7.
  We want to find the smallest positive integer n such that 2t/13 = 5t/7 + n.
  Multiplying both sides by 91, we get 14t = 65t + 91n.
  Rearranging, we get 51t = 91n.
  Since 51 and 91 are relatively prime, the smallest positive integer n that satisfies this equation is n = 51.
  Substituting n = 51, we get 2t/13 = 5t/7 + 51.
  Solving for t, we get t = 131 minutes.
  Therefore, the answer is 2 hours and 11 minutes.

Topic: Math
Question: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
Choices:
  A: 58
  B: 62
  C: 66
  D: 70
  E: 74
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * w, where l is the length and w is the width.
  Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means that the perimeter of the yard is equal to the sum of the lengths of the three fenced sides plus 10 meters.
  The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Action: 
  Let's call the length of the yard l and the width w. We know that lw = 240 and that the perimeter of the yard is 2l + w + 10. We can solve for w in terms of l by using the equation lw = 240, which gives us w = 240/l. Substituting this into the equation for the perimeter, we get P = 2l + 2(240/l) + 10. We want to find the value of P, so we can simplify this expression by multiplying everything by l to get Pl = 2l^2 + 480 + 10l. Rearranging this equation, we get 2l^2 + 10l - Pl + 480 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in l, so we can solve for l using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is l = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 2, b = 10, and c = -P + 480. We know that l must be positive, so we can discard the negative solution. Once we have found l, we can use the equation w = 240/l to find w. Finally, we can use the equation for the perimeter to find P.

  Solving for l using the quadratic formula, we get l = (-10 + sqrt(10^2 - 4(2)(-P + 480))) / (2(2)) = (-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2.
  We know that lw = 240, so w = 240/l.
  The perimeter of the yard is P = 2l + 2w + 10 = 2l + 2(240/l) + 10.

  Now we can substitute the value of l into the equation for the perimeter to find P. We get P = 2((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2) + 2(240/((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2)) + 10. Simplifying this expression, we get P = 10 + 5sqrt(25 + 2P - 960) + 480/((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2). Multiplying both sides by (-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2, we get (-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960))P = 5sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)(-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) + 480(-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2. Simplifying this expression, we get -2P^2 + 50P - 400 = 0. Solving for P using the quadratic formula, we get P = 25 + sqrt(625 + 400) = 25 + 35 = 60.

  Now that we know P = 60, we can substitute this value into the equation for the perimeter to find the length of fencing Alice needs. We get P = 2l + 2w + 10 = 2l + 2(240/l) + 10 = 2(5 + sqrt(25 + 2(60) - 960)) + 2(240/(5 + sqrt(25 + 2(60) - 960))) + 10 = 58.

Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * w, where l is the length and w is the width.
  Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means that the perimeter of the yard is equal to the sum of the lengths of the three fenced sides plus 10 meters.
  The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Action: 
  Let's call the length of the yard l and the width w. We know that lw = 240 and that the perimeter of the yard is 2l + w + 10. We can solve for w in terms of l by using the equation lw = 240, which gives us w = 240/l. Substituting this into the equation for the perimeter, we get P = 2l + 2(240/l) + 10. We want to find the value of P, so we can simplify this expression by multiplying everything by l to get Pl = 2l^2 + 480 + 10l. Rearranging this equation, we get 2l^2 + 10l - Pl + 480 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in l, so we can solve for l using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is l = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 2, b = 10, and c = -P + 480. We know that l must be positive, so we can discard the negative solution. Once we have found l, we can use the equation w = 240/l to find w. Finally, we can use the equation for the perimeter to find P.

  Solving for l using the quadratic formula, we get l = (-10 + sqrt(10^2 - 4(2)(-P + 480))) / (2(2)) = (-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2.
  We know that lw = 240, so w = 240/l.
  The perimeter of the yard is P = 2l + 2w + 10 = 2l + 2(240/l) + 10.

  Now we can substitute the value of l into the equation for the perimeter to find P. We get P = 2((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2) + 2(240/((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2)) + 10. Simplifying this expression, we get P = 10 + 5sqrt(25 + 2P - 960) + 480/((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2). Multiplying both sides by (-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2, we get (-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960))P = 5sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)(-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) + 480(-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2. Simplifying this expression, we get -2P^2 + 50P - 400 = 0. Solving for P using the quadratic formula, we get P = 25 + sqrt(625 + 400) = 25 + 35 = 60.

  Now that we know P = 60, we can substitute this value into the equation for the perimeter to find the length of fencing Alice needs. We get P = 2l + 2w + 10 = 2l + 2(240/l) + 10 = 2(5 + sqrt(25 + 2(60) - 960)) + 2(240/(5 + sqrt(25 + 2(60) - 960))) + 10 = 58.

We want to find the value of P, so we can simplify this expression by multiplying everything by l to get Pl = 2l^2 + 480 + 10l. Rearranging this equation, we get 2l^2 + 10l - Pl + 480 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in l, so we can solve for l using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is l = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 2, b = 10, and c = -P + 480.

  We know that lw = 240, so w = 240/l.
  The perimeter of the yard is P = 2l + 2w + 10 = 2l + 2(240/l) + 10.

  Now we can substitute the value of l into the equation for the perimeter to find P. We get P = 2((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2) + 2(240/((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2)) + 10. Simplifying this expression, we get P = 10 + 5sqrt(25 + 2P - 960) + 480/((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2). Multiplying both sides by (-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2, we get (-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960))P = 5sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)(-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) + 480(-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2.

  Now we can substitute the value of l into the equation for the perimeter to find P. We get P = 2((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2) + 2(240/((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2)) + 10. Simplifying this expression, we get P = 10 + 5sqrt(25 + 2P - 960) + 480/((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2). Multiplying both sides by (-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2, we get (-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960))P = 5sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)(-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) + 480(-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2. Simplifying this expression, we get -2P^2 + 50P - 400 = 0. Solving for P using the quadratic formula, we get P = 25 + sqrt(625 + 400) = 25 + 35 = 60.

  Now that we know P = 60, we can substitute this value into the equation for the perimeter to find the length of fencing Alice needs. We get P = 2l + 2w + 10 = 2l + 2(240/l) + 10 = 2(5 + sqrt(25 + 2(60) - 960)) + 2(240/(5 + sqrt(25 + 2(60) - 960))) + 10 = 58. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * w, where l is the length and w is the width.
  Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means that the perimeter of the yard is equal to the sum of the lengths of the three fenced sides plus 10 meters.
  The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Action: 
  Let's call the length of the yard l and the width w. We know that lw = 240 and that the perimeter of the yard is 2l + w + 10. We can solve for w in terms of l by using the equation lw = 240, which gives us w = 240/l. Substituting this into the equation for the perimeter, we get P = 2l + 2(240/l) + 10. We want to find the value of P, so we can simplify this expression by multiplying everything by l to get Pl = 2l^2 + 480 + 10l. Rearranging this equation, we get 2l^2 + 10l - Pl + 480 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in l, so we can solve for l using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is l = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 2, b = 10, and c = -P + 480. We know that l must be positive, so we can discard the negative solution. Once we have found l, we can use the equation w = 240/l to find w. Finally, we can use the equation for the perimeter to find P.

  Solving for l using the quadratic formula, we get l = (-10 + sqrt(10^2 - 4(2)(-P + 480))) / (2(2)) = (-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2.
  We know that lw = 240, so w = 240/l.
  The perimeter of the yard is P = 2l + 2w + 10 = 2l + 2(240/l) + 10.

  Now we can substitute the value of l into the equation for the perimeter to find P. We get P = 2((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2) + 2(240/((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2)) + 10. Simplifying this expression, we get P = 10 + 5sqrt(25 + 2P - 960) + 480/((-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2). Multiplying both sides by (-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2, we get (-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960))P = 5sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)(-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) + 480(-5 + sqrt(25 + 2P - 960)) / 2. Simplifying this expression, we get -2P^2 + 50P - 400 = 0. Solving for P using the quadratic formula, we get P = 25 + sqrt(625 + 400) = 25 + 35 = 60.

  Now that we know P = 60, we can substitute this value into the equation for the perimeter to find the length of fencing Alice needs. We get P = 2l + 2w + 10 = 2l + 2(240/l) + 10 = 2(5 + sqrt(25 + 2(60) - 960)) + 2(240/(5 + sqrt(25 + 2(60) - 960))) + 10 = 58.

Question: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
Choices:
  A: 20%
  B: 28%
  C: 36%
  D: 40%
  E: 42%
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Let's assume the wholesale cost of the appliance is "x".
  The original retail price of the appliance is 60% more than its wholesale cost, which means the original retail price is (100% + 60%) = 160% of the wholesale cost. So, the original retail price is 1.6x.
  The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which means it was sold for (100% - 20%) = 80% of the original retail price. So, the selling price is 0.8(1.6x) = 1.28x.
  We need to find the percentage more than the wholesale cost that the appliance was sold for. This can be calculated as ((selling price - wholesale cost) / wholesale cost) * 100%.
  ((1.28x - x) / x) * 100% = 28%

Topic: Math
Question: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 1120
  C: 792
  D: 1320
  E: 1200
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  When a rectangular sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is half of the original perimeter.
  The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.
  The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = lw.
  
Action: 
  Let the length and width of the rectangular sheet be l and w, respectively.
  When folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 66/2 = 33 cm.
  Therefore, 2(l + w/2) = 33, which simplifies to l + w = 33/2.
  When folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 48/2 = 24 cm.
  Therefore, 2(w + l/2) = 24, which simplifies to w + l = 24/2.
  Solving the system of equations l + w = 33/2 and w + l = 12 gives l = 9 and w = 3.
  Therefore, the area of the rectangular sheet is lw = 9*3 = 27.

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  When a rectangular sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is half of the original perimeter.
  The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.
  The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = lw.
  
Action: 
  Let the length and width of the rectangular sheet be l and w, respectively.
  When folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 66/2 = 33 cm.
  Therefore, 2(l + w/2) = 33, which simplifies to l + w = 33/2.
  When folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 48/2 = 24 cm.
  Therefore, 2(w + l/2) = 24, which simplifies to w + l = 24/2.
  Solving the system of equations l + w = 33/2 and w + l = 12 gives l = 9 and w = 3.
  Therefore, the area of the rectangular sheet is lw = 9*3 = 27.

Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 12
  C: 16
  D: 24
  E: 25
Response 0:
Let's assume that the total number of friends who planned to go on the picnic was "x". 
The total amount they planned to spend was Rs. 96. 
So, the amount each friend would have to contribute would be 96/x. 

But, 4 friends did not turn up, so the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. 
So, the new amount each friend contributed was (96/x) + 4. 

The total amount collected after 4 friends did not turn up would be (96/x + 4) * (x-4). 
This is because the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. 

We know that the total amount collected after 4 friends did not turn up was still Rs. 96. 
So, we can equate the two expressions: 

(96/x + 4) * (x-4) = 96 

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

96 + 4x - 384/x - 16 = 96 

4x - 384/x = 16 

4(x^2 - 96) / x = 16 

x^2 - 96 = 4x 

x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0 

(x-12)(x+8) = 0 

x = 12 or x = -8 

Since we cannot have a negative number of friends, the number of friends who attended the picnic was 12.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Let's assume that the total number of friends who planned to go on the picnic was "x". 
The total amount they planned to spend was Rs. 96. 
So, the amount each friend would have to contribute would be 96/x. 

But, 4 friends did not turn up, so the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. 
So, the new amount each friend contributed was (96/x) + 4. 

The total amount collected after 4 friends did not turn up would be (96/x + 4) * (x-4). 
This is because the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. 

We know that the total amount collected after 4 friends did not turn up was still Rs. 96. 
So, we can equate the two expressions: 

(96/x + 4) * (x-4) = 96 

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

96 + 4x - 384/x - 16 = 96 

4x - 384/x = 16 

4(x^2 - 96) / x = 16 

x^2 - 96 = 4x 

x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0 

(x-12)(x+8) = 0 

x = 12 or x = -8

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If 20% of the students took physics and 28% of the students took math, it is possible that some students took both physics and math.
  To find the minimum number of students, we need to assume that the number of students who took both physics and math is zero.
  If x is the total number of students, then the number of students who took physics is 0.2x and the number of students who took math is 0.28x.
  The total number of students is at least the sum of the number of students who took physics and the number of students who took math.
  That is, x >= 0.2x + 0.28x = 0.48x.
  Therefore, x >= (1/0.48)x = 2.083x.
  This means that the minimum number of students is at least 2.083 times the number of students who took physics or math.
  To get an integer value for the minimum number of students, we can round up 2.083 to the nearest integer, which is 3.
  Therefore, the minimum number of students is at least 3 times the number of students who took physics or math.
  If we assume that the number of students who took physics or math is 501, then the minimum number of students is 3*501 = 1503.
  Therefore, the answer must be greater than or equal to 1503.

  The only choice that is greater than or equal to 1503 is D: 700.

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
Choices:
  A: 3 hours
  B: 5 hours
  C: 6 hours
  D: 4 hours
  E: 7 hours
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The relative speed between the two cars is the difference between their speeds, which is 55 - 52 = 3 mph.
  We want to find the time it takes for the distance between the two cars to be 15 miles.
  We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  Let's call the time it takes for the two cars to be 15 miles apart "t".
  The distance between the two cars is the relative distance they travel during time "t", which is 3t.
  We know that 3t = 15, since the distance between the two cars is 15 miles.
  Solving for "t", we get t = 5.
  Therefore, it takes 5 hours for the two cars to be 15 miles apart.

Topic: Math
Question: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%. If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is:
Choices:
  A: Rs. 697.50
  B: Rs. 712.50
  C: Rs. 787.50
  D: Rs. 750
  E: Rs. 780
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Let the marked price of the watch be M.
  Let the cost price of the watch be C.
  Let the profit earned by the shopkeeper be P.
  When the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, the selling price of the watch is 0.95M.
  When the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, the selling price of the watch is 0.93M.
  We can set up two equations based on the given information:
    0.95M - C = P
    0.93M - C = P + 15
  We can solve for M by eliminating P:
    0.95M - C = 0.93M - C - 15
    0.02M = 15
    M = 750

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:
Choices:
  A: 2.6m
  B: 3.9m
  C: 4m
  D: 4.2m
  E: 4.4m
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. The semi-perimeter of a room is half the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
  2. The cost of papering the walls of a room depends on the area of the walls and the cost per unit area of the paper.
  3. The area of the doors and windows needs to be subtracted from the total area of the walls to get the actual area of the walls that need to be papered.
  
Solution:
Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y. Then, the length of the room is 5y - 2x and the width of the room is 5y - 2x.
The area of the walls that need to be papered is (2x)(5y - 2x) + (2x)(5y - 2x) + (2x)(5y) = 20xy - 4x^2.
The cost of papering the walls is (20xy - 4x^2)(2/100) = (xy - x^2)(2) = 2xy - 2x^2.
The actual area of the walls that need to be papered is 20xy - 4x^2 - 15.
Therefore, 2xy - 2x^2 = 260/(50/100) = 520.
Simplifying, we get xy - x^2 = 260.
Substituting 5y/2 for x, we get 5y^2/2 - 25y^2/4 = 260.
Simplifying, we get y^2 = 208/5.
Therefore, y = sqrt(208/5)/2.
Substituting for y, we get x = 5sqrt(13/5)/2.
Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 5sqrt(13/5) = 4.33m (approx).
Since none of the choices match exactly, the closest answer is E: 4.4m.

  2. The cost of papering the walls of a room depends on the area of the walls and the cost per unit area of the paper.
  3. The area of the doors and windows needs to be subtracted from the total area of the walls to get the actual area of the walls that need to be papered.
  
Solution:
Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y. Then, the length of the room is 5y - 2x and the width of the room is 5y - 2x.
The area of the walls that need to be papered is (2x)(5y - 2x) + (2x)(5y - 2x) + (2x)(5y) = 20xy - 4x^2.
The cost of papering the walls is (20xy - 4x^2)(2/100) = (xy - x^2)(2) = 2xy - 2x^2.
The actual area of the walls that need to be papered is 20xy - 4x^2 - 15.
Therefore, 2xy - 2x^2 = 260/(50/100) = 520.
Simplifying, we get xy - x^2 = 260.
Substituting 5y/2 for x, we get 5y^2/2 - 25y^2/4 = 260.
Simplifying, we get y^2 = 208/5.
Therefore, y = sqrt(208/5)/2.
Substituting for y, we get x = 5sqrt(13/5)/2.
Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 5sqrt(13/5) = 4.33m (approx).
Since none of the choices match exactly, the closest answer is E: 4.4m.

Question: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are
Choices:
  A: 600, 400
  B: 628, 372
  C: 640, 360
  D: None of these
  E: Cannot be determined
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Let x and y be the two numbers.
  The difference between the squares of two numbers is (x^2 - y^2) = (x + y)(x - y).
  The sum of the numbers is x + y = 1000.
  
Calculation:
  We know that (x^2 - y^2) = 256000.
  We can factor 256000 as 256000 = 400 * 640.
  We can write (x + y)(x - y) = 400 * 640.
  We also know that x + y = 1000.
  We can solve for x - y by dividing both sides of the equation by x + y:
  x - y = (400 * 640) / (x + y)
  x - y = (400 * 640) / 1000
  x - y = 256
  
  Now we have two equations:
  x + y = 1000
  x - y = 256
  
  We can solve for x and y by adding the two equations:
  2x = 1256
  x = 628
  
  Then we can solve for y by substituting x = 628 into one of the equations:
  x + y = 1000
  628 + y = 1000
  y = 372
  
  Therefore, the two numbers are 628 and 372.

  x + y = 1000
  x - y = 256
  
  We can solve for x and y by adding the two equations:
  2x = 1256
  x = 628
  
  Then we can solve for y by substituting x = 628 into one of the equations:
  x + y = 1000
  628 + y = 1000
  y = 372
  
  Therefore, the two numbers are 628 and 372.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Let x and y be the two numbers.
  The difference between the squares of two numbers is (x^2 - y^2) = (x + y)(x - y).
  The sum of the numbers is x + y = 1000.
  
Calculation:
  We know that (x^2 - y^2) = 256000.
  We can factor 256000 as 256000 = 400 * 640.
  We can write (x + y)(x - y) = 400 * 640.
  We also know that x + y = 1000.
  We can solve for x - y by dividing both sides of the equation by x + y:
  x - y = (400 * 640) / (x + y)
  x - y = (400 * 640) / 1000
  x - y = 256
  
  Now we have two equations:
  x + y = 1000
  x - y = 256
  
  We can solve for x and y by adding the two equations:
  2x = 1256
  x = 628
  
  Then we can solve for y by substituting x = 628 into one of the equations:
  x + y = 1000
  628 + y = 1000
  y = 372
  
  Therefore, the two numbers are 628 and 372.

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300.
Choices:
  A: 20
  B: 30
  C: 40
  D: 200
  E: None
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  M is a three-digit number, so a, b, and c are digits.
  N is the number obtained by reversing the digits of M.
  M > N means that a > c or a = c and b > a.
  M - N = 99(a - c) - 9(b - c).
  396c = 4(99c) = 4(M - N + 9(b - c)).
  Therefore, 4 divides M - N + 9(b - c).
  M > 300 means that a = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Action: Answer("C")  
To solve the problem, we need to consider the possible values of a, b, and c, subject to the conditions given in the problem. Since a > c or a = c and b > a, we can assume without loss of generality that a > c. If a = c, then b > a, which implies that b > c. Therefore, we can assume that a > c and b > c. Since M = abc is a three-digit number, we have 1 ≤ a ≤ 9, 0 ≤ b ≤ 9, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 9. Moreover, since M > N, we have a > c or a = c and b > a. If a > c, then M - N = 99(a - c) - 9(b - c) > 0, which implies that b > c. Therefore, we can assume that a > c and b > c. If a = c, then M - N = 99(a - c) - 9(b - c) = 90 - 9(b - c) < 0, which contradicts the assumption that M > N. Therefore, we can assume that a > c. Since 396c = 4(M - N + 9(b - c)) is divisible by 4, we have M - N + 9(b - c) ≡ 0 (mod 4). Since M - N = 99(a - c) - 9(b - c), we have 99(a - c) - 9(b - c) + 9(b - c) ≡ 0 (mod 4), which implies that 99(a - c) ≡ 0 (mod 4). Therefore, a - c ≡ 0 (mod 4). Since a > c, we have a - c ≥ 4. Therefore, the possible values of a are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. For each value of a, we can determine the possible values of b and c, subject to the conditions given in the problem. For example, if a = 3, then we have 300 ≤ M ≤ 399, which implies that 0 ≤ N ≤ 99. Since M > N, we have b > c. Moreover, since M - N + 396c = 990, we have M - N = 990 - 396c ≡ 2 (mod 4). Therefore, 99(a - c) - 9(b - c) ≡ 2 (mod 4), which implies that b - c ≡ 3 (mod 4). Since b > c, we have b - c ≥ 1. Therefore, the possible values of b and c are (1, 8), (5, 2), and (9, 6). Similarly, we can determine the possible values of b and c for each value of a. There are 6 possible values of a, and for each value of a, there are 2 or 3 possible values of b and c. Therefore, there are a total of 6 × 3 = 18 possible values of M that are greater than 300. However, we have counted M = 396 twice, since it satisfies both a = 3 and c = 6. Therefore, the actual number of possible values of M that are greater than 300 is 18 - 1 = 17. Answer("C")

Therefore, 99(a - c) - 9(b - c) ≡ 2 (mod 4), which implies that b - c ≡ 3 (mod 4). Since b > c, we have b - c ≥ 1. Therefore, the possible values of b and c are (1, 8), (5, 2), and (9, 6). Similarly, we can determine the possible values of b and c for each value of a. There are 6 possible values of a, and for each value of a, there are 2 or 3 possible values of b and c. Therefore, there are a total of 6 × 3 = 18 possible values of M that are greater than 300. However, we have counted M = 396 twice, since it satisfies both a = 3 and c = 6. Therefore, the actual number of possible values of M that are greater than 300 is 18 - 1 = 17. Answer("C")

To solve the problem, we need to consider the possible values of a, b, and c, subject to the conditions given in the problem. Since a > c or a = c and b > a, we can assume without loss of generality that a > c. If a = c, then b > a, which implies that b > c. Therefore, we can assume that a > c and b > c. Since M = abc is a three-digit number, we have 1 ≤ a ≤ 9, 0 ≤ b ≤ 9, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 9. Moreover, since M > N, we have a > c or a = c and b > a. If a > c, then M - N = 99(a - c) - 9(b - c) > 0, which implies that b > c. Therefore, we can assume that a > c and b > c. If a = c, then M - N = 99(a - c) - 9(b - c) = 90 - 9(b - c) < 0, which contradicts the assumption that M > N. Therefore, we can assume that a > c. Since 396c = 4(M - N + 9(b - c)) is divisible by 4, we have M - N + 9(b - c) ≡ 0 (mod 4). Since M - N = 99(a - c) - 9(b - c), we have 99(a - c) - 9(b - c) + 9(b - c) ≡ 0 (mod 4), which implies that 99(a - c) ≡ 0 (mod 4). Therefore, a - c ≡ 0 (mod 4). Since a > c, we have a - c ≥ 4.

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?
Choices:
  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
Response 0:
Let's first calculate the total amount invested by A and B for the whole year. A invested for 12 months, and B invested for 10 months (since he joined after 2 months). So, the total investment by A and B is (40000*12) + (60000*10) = 1,320,000.

Now, let's calculate the investment of C. Let's assume C joined after x months. So, his investment would be (120000 * (12-x)).

Total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. So, the remaining profit (after giving C his share) is Rs.225,000.

Now, we can set up an equation using the ratios of their investments to the total investment:

A's share : B's share : Remaining profit = 40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*(12-x) = 480000 : 600000 : 1440000-120000x

We know that C's share is Rs.150,000, which is equal to the remaining profit. So, we can set up another equation:

C's share = Remaining profit = 225000

Now we can solve for x:

480000 : 600000 : 1440000-120000x = 225000

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

2400000 : 3000000 : 7200000-600000x = 1125000

Simplifying, we get:

8 : 10 : 24-2x = 3

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

16 : 20 : 48-4x = 6

Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get:

4 : 8 : 48-4x = 2

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

2 : 0 : 48-4x = -2

Solving for x, we get:

48-4x = -2

4x = 50

x = 12.5

So, C joined after 12.5 months, which is equal to 10+2.5 months after B joined.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's first calculate the total amount invested by A and B for the whole year. A invested for 12 months, and B invested for 10 months (since he joined after 2 months). So, the total investment by A and B is (40000*12) + (60000*10) = 1,320,000.

Question: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 62
  C: 82
  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If we have k consecutive integers, then the sum of these integers is given by the formula: sum = k * (first integer + last integer) / 2
  We know the first integer is -50, so the last integer is (-50 + k - 1) = (-49 + k)
  We are given that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51.
  We can use this information to form an equation: 51 = k * (-50 + (-49 + k)) / 2
  Simplifying this equation, we get: 102 = k * (k - 99)
  This is a quadratic equation that can be solved using the quadratic formula.

Action: Answer("C") 
Solving the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we get:
k = (99 ± sqrt(99^2 - 4*102*(-1))) / 2
k = (99 ± sqrt(40521)) / 2
k ≈ 40.8 or k ≈ 81.2
Since k must be a positive integer, the only possible value for k is 82.
Therefore, the answer is (C) 82.

Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The area of a triangle is given by the formula: (base * height) / 2
  - The two triangles obtained from the rectangular piece are congruent.
  - The original square piece of cloth has four equal sides.
  - The perimeter of a square is given by the formula: 4 * side
  
Let x be the length of one side of the original square piece of cloth.
After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x.
The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so we have:
70 = (base * height) / 2
140 = base * height
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular piece:
diagonal^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2
diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
diagonal = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)
Since the two triangles are congruent, each has base (x-4)/2 and height diagonal/2.
Therefore, we have:
70 = [(x-4)/2 * diagonal/2] / 2
70 = [(x-4)/2 * sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)/2] / 2
70 = (x-4) * sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16) / 8
560 = (x-4)^2 * (2x^2 - 8x + 16) / 64
Multiplying both sides by 64 and simplifying, we get:
8x^3 - 48x^2 + 80x - 256 = 0
Dividing both sides by 8 and simplifying, we get:
x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 32 = 0
This equation can be factored as:
(x-4) * (x^2 - 2x + 8) = 0
The only positive root is x = 4 + sqrt(12) = 4 + 2sqrt(3).
Therefore, the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is:
4 * (4 + 2sqrt(3)) = 16 + 8sqrt(3) ≈ 28.39 ≈ 28.4 (rounded to one decimal place)

Topic: Math
Question: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 15
  C: 12
  D: 6
  E: 3
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Let's assume that the rate of hose A is a and the rate of hose B is b. 
  We can use the formula: rate = work / time
  We can also use the formula: work = rate * time
  If hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, then its rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour.
  If hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, then it filled 2/8 = 1/4 of the pool.
  If the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours, then they filled 3/8 of the pool together.
  We can use the formula: work = rate * time to find the rate of the two hoses working together.
  We can also use the formula: work = rate * time to find the time it would take hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
To find the rate of the two hoses working together:
  Let x be the rate of hose B.
  Then the rate of hose A and B working together is (1/8 + x) of the pool per hour.
  We can use the formula: work = rate * time to find the work done by the two hoses working together.
  (1/8 + x) * 3 = 3/8
  3/8 - 3/8 = 3x/8
  3x/8 = 0
  x = 0
  Therefore, the rate of hose B is 0, which means that hose A filled the entire pool alone in 5 hours.
  We can use the formula: work = rate * time to find the time it would take hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool.
  1 = x * t
  t = 1/x
  Since x = 0, we cannot divide by zero. Therefore, the answer is not defined. However, the most likely answer is C: 12, since it is the closest to the time it took hose A to fill the entire pool alone.

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?
Choices:
  A: 300
  B: 500
  C: 5000
  D: 6000
  E: 7500

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is:
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 11
  C: 12
  D: 13
  E: 14
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If two numbers leave the same remainder when divided by a third number, then their difference is divisible by that third number.
  The sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3 if and only if the number itself is divisible by 3.
  
Let's find the difference between 2272 and 875:
  2272 - 875 = 1397
  
Since the difference is divisible by N, and N is a 3-digit number, then N must be a factor of 1397. The prime factorization of 1397 is 1397 = 19 x 73. Therefore, N must be one of the factors of 1397, which are 1, 19, 73, and 1397.

Let's check each of these factors to see which one satisfies the condition that the remainder is the same when dividing 2272 and 875 by N:
  When dividing 2272 by 1, 19, 73, and 1397, we get remainders of 0, 15, 57, and 1056, respectively.
  When dividing 875 by 1, 19, 73, and 1397, we get remainders of 0, 18, 38, and 875, respectively.
  
Therefore, the only factor that satisfies the condition is N = 73.

The sum of the digits of 73 is 7 + 3 = 10, which is choice A.

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 8
  C: 22
  D: 50
  E: 20
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, then his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour.
  If Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, then the remaining one-third of the work is left for Jill.
  If Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, then her rate of cleaning is 1/20 of the yacht per hour.
  Let's assume that it takes Jill "x" hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work.
  We can use the formula: rate x time = work to solve the problem.

Calculation:
  Jack's rate of cleaning = 1/12 of the yacht per hour
  Jack's time to finish two-thirds of the work = (2/3) / (1/12) = 8 hours
  Jack's work = (2/3) of the yacht
  Jill's rate of cleaning = 1/20 of the yacht per hour
  Jill's work = (1/3) of the yacht
  Jill's time to finish the remaining one-third of the work = (1/3) / (1/20) = 6.67 hours

  If Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, then his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour.
  If Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, then the remaining one-third of the work is left for Jill.
  If Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, then her rate of cleaning is 1/20 of the yacht per hour.
  Let's assume that it takes Jill "x" hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work.
  We can use the formula: rate x time = work to solve the problem.

Calculation:
  Jack's rate of cleaning = 1/12 of the yacht per hour
  Jack's time to finish two-thirds of the work = (2/3) / (1/12) = 8 hours
  Jack's work = (2/3) of the yacht
  Jill's rate of cleaning = 1/20 of the yacht per hour
  Jill's work = (1/3) of the yacht
  Jill's time to finish the remaining one-third of the work = (1/3) / (1/20) = 6.67 hours

Topic: Math
Question: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 3
  C: 2
  D: 1
  E: 0
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Let's assume that the number of copper coins is x and the number of brass coins is y.
  The amount of money the diver gets for each copper coin is 20 cents.
  The amount of money the diver gets for each brass coin is 25 cents.
  The total amount of money the diver got after one dive is $3.40.
  The equation that represents the total amount of money the diver got is 0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40.
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought.
  
Calculation:
  We can solve this problem using trial and error.
  If we assume that the diver brought 1 copper coin, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 0.20)/0.25 - 1 = 12.
  However, 12 is not a minimum number of brass coins that she brought because she could have brought fewer brass coins and more copper coins to get the same amount of money.
  If we assume that the diver brought 2 copper coins, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 0.40)/0.25 - 2 = 10.
  This is a possible solution, but we need to check if there is a solution with fewer copper coins.
  If we assume that the diver brought 3 copper coins, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 0.60)/0.25 - 3 = 8.
  This is a possible solution, but we need to check if there is a solution with fewer copper coins.
  If we assume that the diver brought 4 copper coins, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 0.80)/0.25 - 4 = 6.
  This is a possible solution, but we need to check if there is a solution with fewer copper coins.
  If we assume that the diver brought 5 copper coins, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 1.00)/0.25 - 5 = 4.
  This is a possible solution, but we need to check if there is a solution with fewer copper coins.
  If we assume that the diver brought 6 copper coins, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 1.20)/0.25 - 6 = 2.
  This is a possible solution, but we need to check if there is a solution with fewer copper coins.
  If we assume that the diver brought 7 copper coins, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 1.40)/0.25 - 7 = 0.
  This is a possible solution, and it is the solution with the minimum number of copper coins.

  The amount of money the diver gets for each brass coin is 25 cents.
  The total amount of money the diver got after one dive is $3.40.
  The equation that represents the total amount of money the diver got is 0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40.
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought.
  
Calculation:
  We can solve this problem using trial and error.
  If we assume that the diver brought 1 copper coin, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 0.20)/0.25 - 1 = 12.
  However, 12 is not a minimum number of brass coins that she brought because she could have brought fewer brass coins and more copper coins to get the same amount of money.
  If we assume that the diver brought 2 copper coins, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 0.40)/0.25 - 2 = 10.
  This is a possible solution, but we need to check if there is a solution with fewer copper coins.
  If we assume that the diver brought 3 copper coins, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 0.60)/0.25 - 3 = 8.
  This is a possible solution, but we need to check if there is a solution with fewer copper coins.
  If we assume that the diver brought 4 copper coins, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 0.80)/0.25 - 4 = 6.
  This is a possible solution, but we need to check if there is a solution with fewer copper coins.
  If we assume that the diver brought 5 copper coins, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 1.00)/0.25 - 5 = 4.
  This is a possible solution, but we need to check if there is a solution with fewer copper coins.
  If we assume that the diver brought 6 copper coins, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 1.20)/0.25 - 6 = 2.
  This is a possible solution, but we need to check if there is a solution with fewer copper coins.
  If we assume that the diver brought 7 copper coins, then the number of brass coins she brought is (3.40 - 1.40)/0.25 - 7 = 0.
  This is a possible solution, and it is the solution with the minimum number of copper coins.

Topic: Math
Question: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.
Choices:
  A: 368
  B: 377
  C: 288
  D: 997
  E: 112
Response 0:
Let the three digit number be represented by ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits in the hundreds, tens, and ones places, respectively. 

From the problem statement, we know that:
A + B + C = 17  (Equation 1)
A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109  (Equation 2)
100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A  (Equation 3)

Simplifying Equation 3, we get:
100A - A + 100B - 10B + C - 10C = 495
99A + 90B - 9C = 495
11A + 10B - C = 55  (Equation 4)

We can use Equation 1 to substitute C in terms of A and B:
C = 17 - A - B

Substituting this into Equation 2, we get:
A^2 + B^2 + (17 - A - B)^2 = 109
2A^2 + 2B^2 - 34A - 34B + 178 = 0
A^2 + B^2 - 17A - 17B + 89 = 0  (Equation 5)

We can use Equation 1 to substitute B in terms of A:
B = 17 - A - C
B = 17 - A - (17 - A - B)
2B = 34 - 2A
B = 17 - A  (Equation 6)

Substituting Equation 6 into Equation 5, we get:
A^2 + (17 - A)^2 - 17A - 17(17 - A) + 89 = 0
2A^2 - 34A + 90 = 0
A^2 - 17A + 45 = 0
(A - 5)(A - 12) = 0

Therefore, A = 5 or A = 12. However, since the number is a three digit number, A cannot be 12. Therefore, A = 5.

Using Equation 1, we can find B and C:
B = 17 - A - C = 17 - 5 - B = 12 - B
C = 17 - A - B = 17 - 5 - (12 - B) = B

Therefore, the number is 512, and when we subtract 495 from it, we get 17, which is the reverse of 512.

Therefore, A = 5 or A = 12. However, since the number is a three digit number, A cannot be 12. Therefore, A = 5.

Using Equation 1, we can find B and C:
B = 17 - A - C = 17 - 5 - B = 12 - B
C = 17 - A - B = 17 - 5 - (12 - B) = B

Therefore, the number is 512, and when we subtract 495 from it, we get 17, which is the reverse of 512.

  We can also use the formula nCr = nC(n-r), which is useful when r is close to n/2.

Action: Answer("C")  
We need to find the number of ways to select 5 lime soda bottles out of 10, which is the same as selecting the remaining 5 bottles. Therefore, the number of ways to create two groups of 5 is:
10C5 = 10C(10-5) = 252 / (5! * 5!) = 252 / 120 = 21 / 2 = 126. Therefore, the answer is C.

Topic: Math
Question: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
Choices:
  A: 50
  B: 70
  C: 75
  D: 100
  E: 125
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Let V be the number of files infected by a virus only.
  - Let W be the number of files infected by a worm only.
  - Let B be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
  - We know that V + W + B = 250.
  - We also know that W = 2.5B.
  - We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so V + B = 0.5(250) = 125.
  - We want to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm, which is (V + W).
  
Solution:
  - We know that W = 2.5B, so B = W/2.5.
  - We know that V + B = 125, so V + W/2.5 = 125.
  - Multiplying both sides by 2.5, we get 2.5V + W = 312.5.
  - Adding the equation V + W + B = 250 to 2.5V + W = 312.5, we get 3.5V + 2W + B = 562.5.
  - Substituting B = W/2.5, we get 3.5V + 4.5W = 562.5.
  - We want to find V + W, which is the number of files that were not infected by a worm.
  - We can solve for V by subtracting 2.5 times the equation W = 2.5B from 3.5V + 4.5W = 562.5:
    3.5V + 4.5W - 2.5W = 562.5 - 2.5B
    3.5V + 2W = 562.5 - 2.5(W/2.5)
    3.5V + 2W = 562.5 - W
    3.5V = 562.5 - 3W
    V = (562.5 - 3W)/3.5
  - Substituting this expression for V into V + W, we get:
    (562.5 - 3W)/3.5 + W
    (562.5 + 0.5W)/3.5
  - We want this expression to be an integer, so we need 0.5W to be a multiple of 3.5.
  - The smallest positive integer value of W that satisfies this is W = 7.
  - Substituting W = 7 into (562.5 + 0.5W)/3.5, we get (562.5 + 3.5)/3.5 = 161/2.
  - Therefore, the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is V + W = (562.5 - 3W)/3.5 + W = (562.5 - 3(7))/3.5 + 7 = 150.

Knowledge:
  - Let V be the number of files infected by a virus only.
  - Let W be the number of files infected by a worm only.
  - Let B be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
  - We know that V + W + B = 250.
  - We also know that W = 2.5B.
  - We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so V + B = 0.5(250) = 125.
  - We want to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm, which is (V + W).
  
Solution:
  - We know that W = 2.5B, so B = W/2.5.
  - We know that V + B = 125, so V + W/2.5 = 125.
  - Multiplying both sides by 2.5, we get 2.5V + W = 312.5.
  - Adding the equation V + W + B = 250 to 2.5V + W = 312.5, we get 3.5V + 2W + B = 562.5.
  - Substituting B = W/2.5, we get 3.5V + 4.5W = 562.5.
  - We want to find V + W, which is the number of files that were not infected by a worm.
  - We can solve for V by subtracting 2.5 times the equation W = 2.5B from 3.5V + 4.5W = 562.5:
    3.5V + 4.5W - 2.5W = 562.5 - 2.5B
    3.5V + 2W = 562.5 - 2.5(W/2.5)
    3.5V + 2W = 562.5 - W
    3.5V = 562.5 - 3W
    V = (562.5 - 3W)/3.5
  - Substituting this expression for V into V + W, we get:
    (562.5 - 3W)/3.5 + W
    (562.5 + 0.5W)/3.5
  - We want this expression to be an integer, so we need 0.5W to be a multiple of 3.5.
  - The smallest positive integer value of W that satisfies this is W = 7.
  - Substituting W = 7 into (562.5 + 0.5W)/3.5, we get (562.5 + 3.5)/3.5 = 161/2.
  - Therefore, the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is V + W = (562.5 - 3W)/3.5 + W = (562.5 - 3(7))/3.5 + 7 = 150.

  - Substituting B = W/2.5, we get 3.5V + 4.5W = 562.5.
  - We want to find V + W, which is the number of files that were not infected by a worm.
  - We can solve for V by subtracting 2.5 times the equation W = 2.5B from 3.5V + 4.5W = 562.5:
    3.5V + 4.5W - 2.5W = 562.5 - 2.5B
    3.5V + 2W = 562.5 - 2.5(W/2.5)
    3.5V + 2W = 562.5 - W
    3.5V = 562.5 - 3W
    V = (562.5 - 3W)/3.5
  - Substituting this expression for V into V + W, we get:
    (562.5 - 3W)/3.5 + W
    (562.5 + 0.5W)/3.5
  - We want this expression to be an integer, so we need 0.5W to be a multiple of 3.5.
  - The smallest positive integer value of W that satisfies this is W = 7.

    3.5V + 4.5W - 2.5W = 562.5 - 2.5B
    3.5V + 2W = 562.5 - 2.5(W/2.5)
    3.5V + 2W = 562.5 - W
    3.5V = 562.5 - 3W
    V = (562.5 - 3W)/3.5
  - Substituting this expression for V into V + W, we get:
    (562.5 - 3W)/3.5 + W
    (562.5 + 0.5W)/3.5
  - We want this expression to be an integer, so we need 0.5W to be a multiple of 3.5.
  - The smallest positive integer value of W that satisfies this is W = 7.
  - Substituting W = 7 into (562.5 + 0.5W)/3.5, we get (562.5 + 3.5)/3.5 = 161/2.
  - Therefore, the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is V + W = (562.5 - 3W)/3.5 + W = (562.5 - 3(7))/3.5 + 7 = 150.

Knowledge:
  Profit% = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100
  Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
  We can use these formulas to solve the problem.
  
Action: 
  Let's assume the cost price of the article is x.
  Profit% = 20%
  Selling Price = Rs.360

Topic: Math
Question: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
Choices:
  A: 144km
  B: 72 km
  C: 126km
  D: 84 km
  E: 48km
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The distance between X and Y is the same for both Allen and Bob.
  - Let's call the distance between X and Y "d".
  - Let's call the time it takes for Allen and Bob to meet for the first time "t".
  - When Allen and Bob meet for the first time, they have covered a total distance of "d".
  - When Allen and Bob meet for the second time, they have covered a total distance of "2d".
  - We know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time.
  - We can use the formula distance = speed x time to solve the problem.
  
Solution:
  - Let's call the distance that Allen travels from X to Y "a".
  - When Allen and Bob meet for the first time, Allen has covered "a" and Bob has covered "d - a".

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 28
  C: 30
  D: 53
  E: 59
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the growth rate is exponential.
  If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, which means that the number of water lilies doubles 30 times (since 2^30 is approximately equal to 1 billion).
  If initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake, then the lake will be fully covered with water lilies when there are 2^30 * 64 water lilies on the lake.
Action: 
  The number of water lilies on the lake doubles every two days, which means that the number of water lilies after n days is 64 * 2^(n/2).
  We want to find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, which means that we need to solve the equation 64 * 2^(n/2) = 2^30 * 64.
  Dividing both sides by 64, we get 2^(n/2) = 2^30.
  Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get n/2 = 30.
  Multiplying both sides by 2, we get n = 60.
  Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 60 days.

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
Choices:
  A: 1 hr 23 min
  B: 1 hr 15 min
  C: 1 hr 8 min
  D: 56 min
  E: 55 min
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Train M travels from City A to City B and takes 4 hours.
  Train N travels from City B to City A and takes 3.5 hours.
  The trains cross each other when their total distance traveled is equal to the distance between City A and City B.
  We can use the formula: time = distance / speed
  
Action: 
  Let's first find the distance between City A and City B.
  Let's assume that the speed of both trains is constant.
  Let's denote the speed of Train M as v1 and the speed of Train N as v2.
  Let's denote the time when the trains cross each other as t.
  Distance traveled by Train M = v1 * 4
  Distance traveled by Train N = v2 * 3.5
  Total distance traveled by both trains = v1 * 4 + v2 * 3.5
  Distance between City A and City B = v1 * 4 + v2 * 3.5
  Since the distance traveled by both trains is equal to the distance between City A and City B, we can write:
  v1 * 4 + v2 * 3.5 = distance between City A and City B
  We don't know the exact value of the distance between City A and City B, but we don't need it to find the time when the trains cross each other.
  We can solve for t using the formula:
  t = (distance between City A and City B) / (v1 + v2)
  Therefore, we need to find the value of (v1 + v2).
  We can use the formula: speed = distance / time
  Speed of Train M = v1 = (distance between City A and City B) / 4
  Speed of Train N = v2 = (distance between City A and City B) / 3.5
  Therefore, (v1 + v2) = (distance between City A and City B) * (1/4 + 1/3.5)
  (v1 + v2) = (distance between City A and City B) * (7.5/35)
  (v1 + v2) = (distance between City A and City B) * (3/14)
  Now, we can substitute the value of (v1 + v2) in the formula for t:
  t = (distance between City A and City B) / (v1 + v2)
  t = (distance between City A and City B) / ((distance between City A and City B) * (3/14))
  t = 14/3
  t = 4 hr 40 min
  The trains cross each other 4 hours and 40 minutes after Train M leaves City A, which is at 9:40 am.
  Therefore, the answer is not one of the given choices.

Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Train M travels from City A to City B and takes 4 hours.
  Train N travels from City B to City A and takes 3.5 hours.
  The trains cross each other when their total distance traveled is equal to the distance between City A and City B.
  We can use the formula: time = distance / speed
  
Action: 
  Let's first find the distance between City A and City B.
  Let's assume that the speed of both trains is constant.
  Let's denote the speed of Train M as v1 and the speed of Train N as v2.
  Let's denote the time when the trains cross each other as t.
  Distance traveled by Train M = v1 * 4
  Distance traveled by Train N = v2 * 3.5
  Total distance traveled by both trains = v1 * 4 + v2 * 3.5
  Distance between City A and City B = v1 * 4 + v2 * 3.5
  Since the distance traveled by both trains is equal to the distance between City A and City B, we can write:
  v1 * 4 + v2 * 3.5 = distance between City A and City B
  We don't know the exact value of the distance between City A and City B, but we don't need it to find the time when the trains cross each other.
  We can solve for t using the formula:
  t = (distance between City A and City B) / (v1 + v2)
  Therefore, we need to find the value of (v1 + v2).
  We can use the formula: speed = distance / time
  Speed of Train M = v1 = (distance between City A and City B) / 4
  Speed of Train N = v2 = (distance between City A and City B) / 3.5
  Therefore, (v1 + v2) = (distance between City A and City B) * (1/4 + 1/3.5)
  (v1 + v2) = (distance between City A and City B) * (7.5/35)
  (v1 + v2) = (distance between City A and City B) * (3/14)
  Now, we can substitute the value of (v1 + v2) in the formula for t:
  t = (distance between City A and City B) / (v1 + v2)
  t = (distance between City A and City B) / ((distance between City A and City B) * (3/14))
  t = 14/3
  t = 4 hr 40 min
  The trains cross each other 4 hours and 40 minutes after Train M leaves City A, which is at 9:40 am.
  Therefore, the answer is not one of the given choices.

Topic: Math
Question: 10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand?
Choices:
  A: 10/7
  B: 20/7
  C: 30/7
  D: 40/7
  E: 50/7
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The initial mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay.
  We want to remove and replace some of the mixture with pure sand to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand.
  Let's assume that we need to remove and replace x kg of the mixture.
  After removing and replacing x kg of the mixture, the amount of sand in the mixture will be 0.5(10-x) kg and the amount of clay in the mixture will also be 0.5(10-x) kg.
  We can set up an equation to solve for x.

Calculation:
  Initially, the mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay, which means that it contains 0.3*10 = 3 kg of sand and 0.7*10 = 7 kg of clay.
  After removing and replacing x kg of the mixture, the amount of sand in the mixture will be 0.5(10-x) kg.
  The amount of clay in the mixture will also be 0.5(10-x) kg.
  We want the mixture to contain equal quantities of clay and sand, which means that the amount of sand in the mixture should be equal to the amount of clay in the mixture.
  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
  0.3*10 - 0.3x + x = 0.5(10-x)
  Solving for x, we get:
  x = 4

Final Answer:
  We need to remove and replace 4 kg of the mixture with pure sand.
  To check, after removing and replacing 4 kg of the mixture, the amount of sand in the mixture will be 0.5(10-4) = 3 kg and the amount of clay in the mixture will also be 0.5(10-4) = 3 kg. Therefore, the mixture will contain equal quantities of clay and sand.

  0.3*10 - 0.3x + x = 0.5(10-x)
  Solving for x, we get:
  x = 4

Final Answer:
  We need to remove and replace 4 kg of the mixture with pure sand.
  To check, after removing and replacing 4 kg of the mixture, the amount of sand in the mixture will be 0.5(10-4) = 3 kg and the amount of clay in the mixture will also be 0.5(10-4) = 3 kg. Therefore, the mixture will contain equal quantities of clay and sand.

Question: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre?
Choices:
  A: 3400
  B: 1700
  C: 3440
  D: Cannot be determined
  E: None of these
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides.
  Let's assume that the length of the rectangular plot is L and the width is W.
  The perimeter of the rectangular plot is 2(L+W).
  The cost of gardening 1-meter boundary around the rectangular plot is the cost of gardening the length and width of the rectangular plot plus the cost of gardening the four corners.
  The cost of gardening is given as 10 per square meter.
  The area of the rectangular plot is L*W.
  The area of the 1-meter boundary is (L+2)*(W+2) - L*W = 2L + 2W + 4.
  The cost of gardening the rectangular plot is 10*L*W.
  The cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary is 10*(2L + 2W + 4).
  We are given that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 meters, so 2(L+W) = 340, which simplifies to L+W = 170.
Action: Answer("C")  
To find the cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary, we need to find the values of L and W. We have one equation with two variables, so we cannot determine the values of L and W. However, we can use the fact that the area of the rectangular plot is fixed to find the cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary. The area of the rectangular plot is L*W, which is equal to (L-2)*(W-2) + (2L + 2W + 4). We know that L+W = 170, so we can substitute W = 170-L into the equation for the area to get A = L(170-L) = -L^2 + 170L. The cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary is 10*(2L + 2W + 4) = 10*(2L + 2(170-L) + 4) = 10*(340-2L+4) = 10*(344-2L). The cost of gardening the rectangular plot is 10*L*W = 10*L*(170-L) = -10L^2 + 1700L. Therefore, the total cost of gardening is -10L^2 + 1700L + 10*(344-2L) = -10L^2 + 1740L + 3440. To find the minimum value of this quadratic function, we can use the formula L = -b/(2a) = -1740/(2*(-10)) = 87. The cost of gardening is then -10*87^2 + 1740*87 + 3440 = 298960. Therefore, the answer is C: 3440.

We know that L+W = 170, so we can substitute W = 170-L into the equation for the area to get A = L(170-L) = -L^2 + 170L. The cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary is 10*(2L + 2W + 4) = 10*(2L + 2(170-L) + 4) = 10*(340-2L+4) = 10*(344-2L). The cost of gardening the rectangular plot is 10*L*W = 10*L*(170-L) = -10L^2 + 1700L. Therefore, the total cost of gardening is -10L^2 + 1700L + 10*(344-2L) = -10L^2 + 1740L + 3440. To find the minimum value of this quadratic function, we can use the formula L = -b/(2a) = -1740/(2*(-10)) = 87. The cost of gardening is then -10*87^2 + 1740*87 + 3440 = 298960. Therefore, the answer is C: 3440.

  Let's assume that the length of the rectangular plot is L and the width is W.
  The perimeter of the rectangular plot is 2(L+W).
  The cost of gardening 1-meter boundary around the rectangular plot is the cost of gardening the length and width of the rectangular plot plus the cost of gardening the four corners.
  The cost of gardening is given as 10 per square meter.
  The area of the rectangular plot is L*W.
  The area of the 1-meter boundary is (L+2)*(W+2) - L*W = 2L + 2W + 4.

Action: Answer("C")  
To find the cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary, we need to find the values of L and W. We have one equation with two variables, so we cannot determine the values of L and W. However, we can use the fact that the area of the rectangular plot is fixed to find the cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary. The area of the rectangular plot is L*W, which is equal to (L-2)*(W-2) + (2L + 2W + 4).

  A: 50 %
  B: 60 %
  C: 55 %
  D: 70 %
  E: 58%
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Percentage gain is calculated as (Profit/Cost Price) * 100
  Cost Price is the price at which the merchant purchased the oranges.
  Profit is the difference between the Selling Price and the Cost Price.
  Selling Price is the price at which the merchant sold the oranges.
  The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450, so the Cost Price of 1 kg of oranges is Rs. 5.
  The merchant sold 90 kg of oranges at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg, so the Selling Price of 1 kg of oranges is Rs. 7.50.

Calculation:
  Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
         = Rs. 7.50 - Rs. 5
         = Rs. 2.50
  Percentage gain = (Profit/Cost Price) * 100

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father?
Choices:
  A: 45
  B: 48
  C: 50
  D: 55
  E: 58
Response 0:
Let's start by assigning variables to the ages of Joe, his sister, and his father. Let J be Joe's age, S be his sister's age, and F be his father's age. 

From the first sentence, we know that:

J + S + F = 100

From the second sentence, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as she is now. Let's call the number of years until Joe is as old as his father "x". Then we have:

J + x = F
S + x = 2S

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

x = S

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

J + S + F = 100
J + x + F = 100
F = 100 - J - x

Substituting the expressions for F and x into the second sentence, we get:

100 - J - x = 2(S - x)
100 - J - x = 2S - 2x
J + S + x = 50

Substituting x = S into this equation, we get:

J + S + S = 50
J + 2S = 50

Now we have three equations:

J + S + F = 100
J + x = F
J + 2S = 50

We can solve for J in the third equation:

J = 50 - 2S

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

50 - 2S + x = F

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

(50 - 2S) + S + (50 - 2S + x) = 100
100 - S - x = 4S - 100
200 - S - x = 4S
200 - x = 5S
S = 40

Substituting S = 40 into the equation for J, we get:

J = 50 - 2(40) = -30

This doesn't make sense, so we made a mistake somewhere. Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.

Topic: Math
Question: Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 23
  C: 16
  D: 18
  E: 12
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  For each head, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan.
  For each tail, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher.
  After 20 flips, neither of them won or lost any amount.
  Let's assume that the coin landed on heads x times.
  Therefore, it landed on tails (20-x) times.
  Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan x times.
  Jonathan gave $3 to Christopher (20-x) times.
  The total amount given by Christopher to Jonathan is 2x.
  The total amount given by Jonathan to Christopher is 3(20-x) = 60-3x.
  Since they didn't win or lose any amount, the total amount given by Christopher to Jonathan should be equal to the total amount given by Jonathan to Christopher.
  Therefore, 2x = 60-3x.

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Distance = Speed x Time
  - Let's call the distance between A and B "d"
  - Let's call the time it takes Kevin to drive from A to B "t1"
  - Let's call the time it takes Kevin to drive from B to A "t2"
  - We know that t2 = t1 - 3 (since he has 3 hours left in his trip when he is 70 miles away from B)
  - We also know that d = 70 + 90 = 160 (since he drives the same distance twice)
  - We can use the formula Distance = Speed x Time to create an equation for each leg of the trip:
    - d = 70t1 (from A to B)
    - d = 90t2 (from B to A)
    - Substituting t2 = t1 - 3, we get d = 90(t1 - 3)
    - Setting the two expressions for d equal to each other, we get 70t1 = 90(t1 - 3)
    - Solving for t1, we get t1 = 27

### Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
What is that number?
Choices:
  A: 42857
  B: 32456
  C: 76523
  D: 24567
  E: 43566
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  To solve this problem, we need to use algebraic equations.
  Let's assume the 5 digit number is "abcde".
  According to the problem, if we add a 1 after it, the new number becomes "abcde1" and it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it, which is "1abcde".
  We can write this as an equation: 3(1abcde) = abcde1
  Simplifying this equation, we get: 299997a + 29997b + 2997c + 297d + 30e = 10a + b + c + d + e + 3
  Rearranging the terms, we get: 299986a + 29996b + 2967c + 267d = 27e + 3
  Since the left-hand side of the equation is divisible by 3, the right-hand side must also be divisible by 3. Therefore, e must be either 0 or 3.
  If e = 0, then the left-hand side of the equation is divisible by 27, but the right-hand side is not. Therefore, e must be 3.
  Substituting e = 3 into the equation, we get: 299986a + 29996b + 2967c + 267d = 84
  Since the left-hand side of the equation is divisible by 3, the right-hand side must also be divisible by 3. Therefore, d must be either 0 or 3 or 6 or 9.
  If d = 0, then the left-hand side of the equation is divisible by 9, but the right-hand side is not. Therefore, d must be either 3 or 6 or 9.
  Substituting d = 3 into the equation, we get: 299986a + 29996b + 2967c = 57
  Since the left-hand side of the equation is divisible by 3, the right-hand side must also be divisible by 3. Therefore, c must be either 0 or 3 or 6 or 9.
  If c = 0, then the left-hand side of the equation is divisible by 9, but the right-hand side is not. Therefore, c must be either 3 or 6 or 9.
  Substituting c = 3 into the equation, we get: 299986a + 29996b = 6
  Since the left-hand side of the equation is divisible by 2, the right-hand side must also be divisible by 2. Therefore, b must be even.
  If b = 2, then the left-hand side of the equation is not an integer. Therefore, b must be 4 or 6 or 8.
  Substituting b = 4 into the equation, we get: 299986a = 2
  This is not possible, since a must be an integer between 1 and 9.
  Substituting b = 6 into the equation, we get: 299986a = 1
  This is not possible, since a must be an integer between 1 and 9.
  Substituting b = 8 into the equation, we get: 299986a = 0
  This is not possible, since a must be an integer between 1 and 9.
  Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.

  Let's assume the 5 digit number is "abcde".
  According to the problem, if we add a 1 after it, the new number becomes "abcde1" and it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it, which is "1abcde".
  We can write this as an equation: 3(1abcde) = abcde1
  Simplifying this equation, we get: 299997a + 29997b + 2997c + 297d + 30e = 10a + b + c + d + e + 3

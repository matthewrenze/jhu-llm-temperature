Topic: Logic
Context: The basis of life-the main component of protein is an amino acid molecule.It is an organic molecule.Although people have not directly observed amino acid molecules in cosmic space, scientists have used hydrogen, water, oxygen, methane and formaldehyde in the laboratory to simulate the natural conditions of space.Kinds of amino acids.The raw materials used to synthesize amino acids are abundant in interstellar molecules.It is not difficult to imagine that there must also be amino acid molecules in the universe.As long as there is an appropriate environment, they may be transformed into proteins and further develop into organic life.According to this speculation, there are living bodies on other planets than the earth, and may even be living bodies with higher intelligence.
Question: Which of the following is true to best refute the above speculation?
Choices:
  A: There is a huge difference between the process of developing from protein to organic life and the process from organic molecules to protein
  B: Higher intelligence is not only a product of material evolution, but also a product of continuous socialization

Context: Why did ancient Greece have a city-state system, but there was a long-standing monarchy in Eastern countries?

Choices:
  A: City-state manufacturing has brought about the autonomy of citizens, and the monarchy has created the slavery of Shunmin.

### Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: European fern is a poisonous wild grass that has spread and destroyed many pastures in the northern hemisphere in recent years.One way to deal with this wild grass is to spend less money and be self-sustaining by introducing the natural enemy of this plant.Therefore, some scientists suggested that the moths that feed on the European fern produced in the southern hemisphere were released into the northern hemisphere affected by this wild grass to control the growth of the European fern.
Question: If the scientist ’s proposal to control the European fern is adopted, which of the following is necessary for its success?
Choices:
  A: This northern fern of the northern hemisphere also grows in areas with similar climate and soil conditions in the southern hemisphere.
  B: In addition to eating European ferns, the moths they stock also eat other wild grasses that grow in the northern hemisphere.
  C: The stocked moths can survive in the northern hemisphere and can form a large enough group to reduce the number of European ferns and prevent their growth.
  D: When the number of European ferns decreases, livestock will become immune to diseases caused by this wild grass.

### Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: In a cooking competition, the chef is required to make one hot dish and one cold dish, and the results are evaluated as "top grade", "middle grade", and "bottom grade".If each result of the chef is not lower than that of Chef B, and at least one item is higher than Chef B, it is said that "Chef A is more skilled than Chef B".There are a number of existing chefs, none of them is more skilled than the other, and no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes.
Question: How many chefs can meet the above conditions?
Choices:
  A: unconfirmed
  B: 9 people
  C: 6 people
  D: 3 people
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The question describes a situation where there are multiple chefs, each making a hot and a cold dish, and being evaluated as top, middle, or bottom grade.
  To be considered more skilled than another chef, Chef A must have at least one dish with a higher grade than Chef B, and all other dishes must have a grade that is not lower than Chef B's corresponding dish.
  No two chefs have the same combination of hot and cold dishes.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If there are 6 chefs, then each chef can be paired with 5 other chefs. For each pair of chefs, there are 3 possible outcomes: Chef A is more skilled, Chef B is more skilled, or they have the same skill level. Since no two chefs have the same combination of hot and cold dishes, each pair of chefs will have a unique outcome. Therefore, there can be at most 15 different outcomes (6 choose 2). Since no chef can be more skilled than another chef, there must be at least one chef with the same skill level as each of the other 5 chefs. This means that there can be at most 5 different outcomes where one chef is more skilled than another. Therefore, there must be at least 10 outcomes where the chefs have the same skill level. Since there are only 15 possible outcomes, this means that there can be at most 5 outcomes where the chefs have different skill levels. This can only happen if there is one chef who is more skilled than all the others, and one chef who is less skilled than all the others. Therefore, there must be at least 4 chefs with the same skill level. If there were only 4 chefs with the same skill level, then the remaining 2 chefs would have to be more skilled than all the others, which is not possible. Therefore, there must be at least 5 chefs with the same skill level. If there were 7 or more chefs with the same skill level, then there would be at most 3 chefs with a different skill level, which is not possible. Therefore, there must be exactly 6 chefs with the same skill level. Since no two chefs have the same combination of hot and cold dishes, there can be at most one chef with each combination of hot and cold dishes. Therefore, there can be at most 6 chefs.

This means that there can be at most 5 different outcomes where one chef is more skilled than another. Therefore, there must be at least 10 outcomes where the chefs have the same skill level. Since there are only 15 possible outcomes, this means that there can be at most 5 outcomes where the chefs have different skill levels. This can only happen if there is one chef who is more skilled than all the others, and one chef who is less skilled than all the others. Therefore, there must be at least 4 chefs with the same skill level. If there were only 4 chefs with the same skill level, then the remaining 2 chefs would have to be more skilled than all the others, which is not possible. Therefore, there must be at least 5 chefs with the same skill level. If there were 7 or more chefs with the same skill level, then there would be at most 3 chefs with a different skill level, which is not possible. Therefore, there must be exactly 6 chefs with the same skill level. Since no two chefs have the same combination of hot and cold dishes, there can be at most one chef with each combination of hot and cold dishes. Therefore, there can be at most 6 chefs.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The question describes a situation where there are multiple chefs, each making a hot and a cold dish, and being evaluated as top, middle, or bottom grade.
  To be considered more skilled than another chef, Chef A must have at least one dish with a higher grade than Chef B, and all other dishes must have a grade that is not lower than Chef B's corresponding dish.
  No two chefs have the same combination of hot and cold dishes.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If there are 6 chefs, then each chef can be paired with 5 other chefs. For each pair of chefs, there are 3 possible outcomes: Chef A is more skilled, Chef B is more skilled, or they have the same skill level. Since no two chefs have the same combination of hot and cold dishes, each pair of chefs will have a unique outcome. Therefore, there can be at most 15 different outcomes (6 choose 2). Since no chef can be more skilled than another chef, there must be at least one chef with the same skill level as each of the other 5 chefs. This means that there can be at most 5 different outcomes where one chef is more skilled than another. Therefore, there must be at least 10 outcomes where the chefs have the same skill level.

### Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Zhang Qiang? When the economy in a region is sluggish, many people are unemployed, so they reduce their living expenses, resulting in more unemployment and worsening the economy.The economy continued to deteriorate, and finally prices fell to the lowest point.Low prices have stimulated people to increase their living consumption, and increased consumption has led to improved economic conditions.Li Ming? If people are unemployed, they will not be able to increase their consumption, nor will they have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.Therefore, falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
Question: If the following statement is true, which one can best weaken Li Ming's rebuttal to Zhang Qiang?
Choices:
  A: After the economic situation improves, the company will hire more people, and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed.
  B: Even if the economic situation continues to deteriorate, consumers still believe that the economic situation will eventually improve.
  C: Even when the economy is extremely deteriorating, the unemployed must continue to buy necessities such as food.
  D: During the period of economic deterioration, even unemployed people will compress expenditures; when prices fall to the lowest point, they will have savings for consumption.

Topic: Logic
Context: The traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.There is no other explanation.The fiction says that the Eight Diagrams are named after the name of an object, For example, Qiangua is the heaven, and Qian is the ancient Chinese character, so it is named Qian; in the sense of meaning, the image of hexagrams represents the principle of things, and its rationality is taken as the name of a hexagram.The Lord is supple, so the hexagram is Kun, and Kun is the meaning of suppleness
Question: Which of the following statements is true, which most seriously shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name?
Choices:
  A: The reason why the two hexagrams of Qiankun ranks first among the sixty-four hexagrams is because the Qian gua represents heaven and the Kun gua represents earth.
  B: The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone.Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names
  C: Although there are many different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, it is inseparable from its sect, either attributed to the theory of fetching images, or attributed to the theory of fetching meanings

  The unit arranges for 6 people on duty on the first day, second day, third day of the new year.
  Two people are required per day.
  (1) L and P must be on duty on the same day.
  (2) G and H cannot be on duty on the same day.
  (3) If K is on the first day of duty, then G is on the second day of duty.
  (4) If S is on the third day of duty, then H is on the second day of duty.
  
To satisfy the conditions, we can start by making a table with the days and the possible pairs of people who can be on duty on each day. 

| Day | Pair 1 | Pair 2 | Pair 3 |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1   | G, L   | H, P   | K, S   |
| 2   | H, S   | G, P   | K, L   |
| 3   | G, S   | H, L   | K, P   |

If H is on duty the same day before S, then H cannot be on the third day of duty. Therefore, H must be on the first or second day of duty. 

If H is on the first day of duty, then G cannot be on the second day of duty because G and H cannot be on duty on the same day. Therefore, K must be on the first day of duty, and G must be on the second day of duty according to condition (3). This means that S must be on the third day of duty, and H must be on the second day of duty according to condition (4). However, this arrangement violates condition (1) because L and P cannot be on duty on different days. Therefore, H cannot be on the first day of duty.

If H is on the second day of duty, then S must be on the third day of duty according to condition (4). This means that G cannot be on the third day of duty because G and S cannot be on duty on the same day. Therefore, G must be on the first day of duty, and K must be on the second day of duty according to condition (3). This leaves L and P to be on duty on the third day of duty, satisfying condition (1). Therefore, the answer is A: G on the second day of duty.

Choices:
  A: The earliest stars contained only hydrogen.
  B: When the universe was less than 1.5 billion years old, some stars had already formed.
  C: This nebula also contains hydrogen and helium.
  D: The carbon in this nebula later formed part of some stars.

### Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: The tragedy of gun violence in the United States has once again triggered discussions on gun control.Opponents of gun control claim that gun violence in the United States soared in the 1980s.In 1986, some states implemented strict gun control through legal means, but the average violent crime rate in those states that enforced strict gun control was the average violent crime rate in other states 1.5 times.It can be seen that strict gun control does not help reduce violent crime.
Question: If the following statement is true, which one weakens the above argument the strongest?
Choices:
  A: Since 1986, the proportion of American households with guns has declined significantly.
  B: Since 1986, the annual number of violent crimes in these states that have imposed strict gun control has continued to decline.
  C: In states that enforce strict gun control laws, few people violate this law.
  D: The criminologist compared the results of various investigations and found no obvious correlation between the number of privately owned guns and gun violence.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that strict gun control does not help reduce violent crime, and supports this claim by stating that the average violent crime rate in states with strict gun control is 1.5 times higher than in other states.
  A: This statement is not directly related to the argument, as it does not address the impact of strict gun control on violent crime rates.
  B: This statement weakens the argument, as it suggests that violent crime rates have continued to decline in states with strict gun control, despite the implementation of these laws.

  Finally, the statement states that Greece will either reduce welfare or achieve substantial economic development, otherwise, the debt crisis will be a difficult problem.

Analysis:
  Based on the given information, we can conclude that if Greece wants to solve the debt crisis, it must either reduce welfare or achieve substantial economic development.
  The statement also mentions that only through extensive reforms can Greece return to the path of economic development.
  Therefore, we can conclude that if Greece wants to solve the debt crisis, it must undergo extensive reforms, reduce welfare, or achieve substantial economic development.
  However, we cannot conclude that if Greece reduces welfare or achieves substantial economic development, it can solve the debt crisis, as there may be other factors at play.
  We also cannot conclude that if the Greek debt crisis is properly resolved, it will not have a negative impact on the economy of the euro area, as the statement mentions that if the debt crisis is not resolved, it will have a negative impact.
  Similarly, we cannot conclude that if Greece does not reduce welfare or cannot achieve substantial economic development, it will have a negative impact on the economy of the euro area, as the statement does not provide enough information to support this claim.

Context: There are 7 heart disease patients E, F, G, H, I, J, K to be assigned to 4 doctors for treatment, they are Dr.Zhang, Dr.Li, Dr.Wang and Dr.Liu.Only one doctor is responsible for each patient, and each doctor is responsible for the treatment of up to two patients.Among the patients, J and K are children, and the remaining 5 are adults; E, F, and J are males, and the remaining 4 are females.The following conditions must be met? (1) Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.(2) Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.(3) If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.
Question: According to the question, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Dr.Wang is responsible for treating at least one female patient.
  B: Dr.Wang is responsible for treating at least one child patient.
  C: Dr.Liu is responsible for treating at least one male patient.
  D: Dr.Liu is responsible for treating at least one child patient.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 patients to be assigned to 4 doctors.
  Only one doctor is responsible for each patient, and each doctor is responsible for the treatment of up to two patients.
  Among the patients, J and K are children, and the remaining 5 are adults; E, F, and J are males, and the remaining 4 are females.
  Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.
  Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.
  If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.

Analysis:
  Dr.Zhang can only treat male patients, so he cannot treat J or K.
  Dr.Li can only treat 1 patient, so he cannot treat J and K together.
  If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child. So, if J or K is assigned to a doctor, then an adult patient of the same sex as J or K must also be assigned to the same doctor.
  There are 3 male patients (E, F, J) and 4 female patients (G, H, I, K). So, at least one doctor must treat both a male and a female patient.

Topic: Logic
Context: Researchers in a country reported that they found meteorites about 200 million years old in the strata of a certain area, and they were probably traces of flying objects when a huge meteorite hit the present province of Quebec, Canada.The clay layer with a thickness of about 5 cm also contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are 50 to 2000 times the concentration normally found on the ground.In addition, this rock also contains special minerals in the formation of the late Bacques.Since the upper and lower strata also contain marine plankton fossils, it can be determined that the impact period was about 215 million years ago.
Question: Which of the following, if true, would best support the above research findings?
Choices:
  A: The rock was formed after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground
  B: In the late Paleozoic Triassic (approximately 200 million to 237 million years ago) ammonite and other species were extinct on a large scale

### Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.
  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.

### Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: I can relate some external symbols to some inner events, for example, to associate moaning and face distortion with the feeling of pain.I learned from the pain experience that when I feel pain, I often moan and twist my face.Therefore, once I see that others have the same external signs, I take it for granted that they also have the same inner activity events as me.After all, between me and others, the behavior and normal physiological functions are obviously similar.Why aren't they similar in inner activities?
Question: Which of the following can most strongly support the above argument?
Choices:
  A: Similar results must have similar reasons.
  B: There may be a close connection between pain and moaning and face twisting.
  C: There may be an intrinsic relationship between behavior and inner activities.
  D: People are similar in many ways.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The argument is that because the speaker associates moaning and face distortion with the feeling of pain, and because they have learned from their own pain experience that these external signs are associated with inner activity events, they assume that others who exhibit the same external signs are also experiencing the same inner activity events. Choice B most strongly supports this argument by suggesting that there may be a close connection between pain and moaning and face twisting. The other choices are either too general (A and D) or not directly related to the argument (C).

Context: The lower the credit rating of the borrower, the higher the cost of borrowing and the higher the rate of return for the creditor.On August 5, 2011, S & P downgraded the US sovereign credit rating from AAA to AA +.According to common sense, investors should reduce their holdings of U.S.Treasury bonds when they are in a safe haven, thereby pushing their prices down and yields rising.However, on August 8, the price of US Treasury bonds rose, and the yield fell, and the yield of the latest 10-year US Treasury bond fell to 2.34%, a new low this year.
Question: If any of the following statements are true, can we best explain the above-mentioned violation of common sense?
Choices:
  A: On the evening of August 5, the US Treasury responded that S & P had a $ 2 trillion error in its rating calculations.
  B: Compared with the bonds of the European Union, Japan and other countries, US Treasuries are still relatively safe and liquid investment products.
  C: After the US sovereign credit rating was lowered, Russia began to reduce its holdings of US Treasury bonds, while China still increased its holdings of US Treasury bonds.
  D: In order to break the monopoly of three US rating agencies including S & P, the EU plans to establish a European credit rating agency.

### Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: When the number of cod in the North Atlantic Ocean decreased significantly, the number of seals increased from 1.5 million to about 2.5 million.Some people think that seals have caused a decrease in cod, but seals rarely eat cod, so it is unlikely that a large increase in the number of seals caused a significant decline in the number of cod.
Question: Which of the following statements, if true, can weaken the argument most strongly?
Choices:
  A: In the traditional cod fishing belt, a large number of seals caused great inconvenience to the fishing boat.
  B: The damage caused by seawater pollution to cod is more serious than that caused to seals.
  C: Before the number of seals increased, the number of cod in the North Atlantic Ocean was greatly reduced.
  D: Cod almost only eat capelin, and this fish is also the main food for seals.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that it is unlikely that a large increase in the number of seals caused a significant decline in the number of cod because seals rarely eat cod.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument.
  C: This statement does not weaken the argument, but rather supports it by suggesting that something else caused the decline in the number of cod before the number of seals increased.

### Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: This summer, the extremely high temperature and drought hit Chongqing and Sichuan, including the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River, nearly one million square kilometers.Some people said on the Internet that the construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir caused the high temperature and drought in this area, and it is difficult to reverse.
Question: If the following items are true, you can question the above points, except?
Choices:
  A: The hot and dry weather encountered in Chongqing and Sichuan this year is the worst in 50 years in terms of the scope and duration of the impact.
  B: Simulation studies have shown that the water range of the Three Gorges Reservoir area has an impact on climate of about 20 kilometers.
  C: This year, the relatively high water temperature in the western Pacific has caused the subtropical high pressure to be more northerly and more westward than in previous years.At the same time, the cold air in the north is weaker, resulting in reduced precipitation in Chongqing and Sichuan.
  D: From winter to spring, the snowfall on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is 20% less than normal, resulting in a significant plateau thermal effect and reduced water vapor output.

### Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Crimes involving the use of firearms are more likely to lead to murder than other types of crimes.However, most crimes involving the use of firearms did not result in homicides.Therefore, there is no need to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense in the criminal law from other criminal offenses.
Question: The logic loophole in the above argument is most similar to the following one?
Choices:
  A: Obese people are more likely to suffer from heart disease than people with normal weight.However, obese people make up a very small percentage of our population.Therefore, in our country, there is no need for the medical and health community to emphasize the risk of heart disease.
  B: Unchecked sex is more likely to be infected with AIDS than checkpoint.However, among people with unchecked sex, only a small percentage of people are infected with AIDS.Therefore, there is no need to emphasize the harm of unchecked sex in the propaganda of AIDS prevention.
  C: The prevailing view is that smoking is more likely to cause lung cancer than not smoking.However, in some countries, the proportion of people with lung cancer who have a history of smoking is not higher than the proportion of the total population who have a history of smoking.Therefore, the above popular opinion is likely to be a prejudice.
  D: High-income people are more capable of enjoying life than low-income people.But there are many high-income earners who claim to be unhappy.Therefore, those who pursue a happy life need not pay attention to the level of income.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

The logic loophole in the argument is that the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The argument states that crimes involving firearms are more likely to lead to murder, but most crimes involving firearms did not result in homicides. However, this does not necessarily mean that the illegal use of firearms should not be considered a serious criminal offense. Similarly, in option A, the argument states that obese people are more likely to suffer from heart disease, but they make up a small percentage of the population. However, this does not necessarily mean that the risk of heart disease should not be emphasized. Both arguments commit the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Option B is not similar because it does not commit the same logical fallacy. Option C is not similar because it is about a popular opinion that may be a prejudice, not a logical argument. Option D is not similar because it is about pursuing a happy life, not a logical argument.

The logic loophole in the argument is that the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The argument states that crimes involving firearms are more likely to lead to murder, but most crimes involving firearms did not result in homicides. However, this does not necessarily mean that the illegal use of firearms should not be considered a serious criminal offense. Similarly, in option A, the argument states that obese people are more likely to suffer from heart disease, but they make up a small percentage of the population. However, this does not necessarily mean that the risk of heart disease should not be emphasized. Both arguments commit the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Option B is not similar because it does not commit the same logical fallacy. Option C is not similar because it is about a popular opinion that may be a prejudice, not a logical argument. Option D is not similar because it is about pursuing a happy life, not a logical argument.

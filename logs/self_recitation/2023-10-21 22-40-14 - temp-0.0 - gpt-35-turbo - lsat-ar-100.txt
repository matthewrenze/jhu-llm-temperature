Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  - Three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Each student reviews one or more of the three plays.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Solution:
  - If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot review Undulation.
  - Therefore, the three students who review Undulation are Jiang, Lopez, and Megregian.
  - From the given conditions, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Therefore, Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  - So, option C is not true.
  - From the given conditions, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Therefore, Megregian must review all three plays.
  - So, option A is not true.

  - Therefore, either Jiang and Lopez review the same play or O'Neill and Kramer review the same play.
  - So, option D or E could be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We need to determine if it is possible to make a trade that results in the given buildings owned by the three companies.
  
Analysis:
  Option A is not possible because RealProp owns a class 1 building and Southco does not own any class 3 building to trade for the Garza Tower.
  Option B is not possible because RealProp owns a class 3 building and Trustcorp does not own any class 1 building to trade for the Yates House.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 

Using condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and D because they only have one student reviewing Tamerlane.

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, we can eliminate option E because it includes Lopez and O'Neill, who both review plays that Jiang may have reviewed.

Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, we can eliminate option C because it includes all three students reviewing Tamerlane, which would mean that Megregian reviews all three plays, contradicting condition 3.

Context: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

  B: Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, and the fifth audition must be recorded, so Waite must be first, followed by Kammer, then the fifth audition (which is recorded), then Zinn, Lugo, and Trillo. This order satisfies all the conditions.
  C: Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, but Trillo is after Lugo, which contradicts the second condition. Therefore, this order is not possible.
  D: Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, and the fifth audition must be recorded, so Waite must be first, followed by Zinn, then Kammer (because Kammer's audition must be before Trillo's), then Trillo, Lugo, and Yoshida. This order contradicts the last condition, which states that Zinn's audition must be before Yoshida's audition. Therefore, this order is not possible.
  E: Zinn's audition must be before Yoshida's audition, so Zinn must be first, followed by Yoshida. However, the third audition must be Kammer's audition, which contradicts the second condition. Therefore, this order is not possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the following:
  1. Julio's session is on Thursday afternoon.
  2. Olivia's session is on Friday (because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's).
  3. Nessa's session is on Wednesday (because Nessa must lead an afternoon session and there is only one afternoon session on Wednesday).
  4. Lan's session cannot be on Thursday (because Olivia's session is on Friday and Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day). Therefore, Lan's session is on Wednesday morning.
  5. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Since there is only one day left (Thursday morning), Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Thursday morning session.
  
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions for all lab assistants except for one. The lab assistant whose session we cannot determine is the one who has not been mentioned yet. Therefore, the answer is:

Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and either K or L must be selected as a chemist. M cannot be selected because if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, which would violate the condition that P is the only zoologist selected. 

Analysis:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. It is possible to select K and G along with P, and one of the other botanists.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. It is possible to select L and F along with P, and one of the other botanists.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. - This is not necessarily true. It is possible to select L and G along with P, and one of the botanists.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. - This is true. If exactly two chemists are selected, they must be K and L. If F is selected as a botanist, then there would be two botanists and only one chemist, which violates the condition that there must be at least one scientist of each type.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session?
Choices:
  A: Julio, Nessa
  B: Kevin, Rebecca
  C: Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  E: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Rebecca

  The lab assistant who leads the Thursday afternoon session cannot be Lan or Olivia.
  
  From the given information, we know that Kevin's session is on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday. Also, Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so neither of them can lead the Thursday afternoon session. This means that the lab assistant who leads the Thursday afternoon session must be either Julio, Kevin, or Rebecca.

  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  The lab assistant who leads the Thursday afternoon session cannot be Lan or Olivia.
  
  From the given information, we know that Kevin's session is on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday. Also, Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so neither of them can lead the Thursday afternoon session. This means that the lab assistant who leads the Thursday afternoon session must be either Julio, Kevin, or Rebecca.
  
  A: Julio's session is on Wednesday, so he cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Incorrect.
  B: Kevin's session is on Thursday afternoon, so he could lead the Thursday afternoon session. Rebecca must lead a session on the same day as Kevin, so she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Incorrect.
  C: Kevin's session is on Thursday afternoon, so he could lead the Thursday afternoon session. Rebecca must lead a session on the same day as Kevin, so she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Incorrect.
  D: Kevin's session is on Thursday afternoon, so he could lead the Thursday afternoon session. Rebecca must lead a session on the same day as Kevin, so she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Julio's session is on Wednesday, so he cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Incorrect.
  E: Kevin's session is on Thursday afternoon, so he could lead the Thursday afternoon session. Rebecca must lead a session on the same day as Kevin, so she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Julio's session is on Wednesday, so he cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Lan cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because she cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia. Therefore, the only lab assistant who could lead the Thursday afternoon session is Kevin. Correct.

Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, which one of the following is the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform?

The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?

  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor

Therefore, the only possible options are Franz's oil and Greene's oil, since Hidalgo's oil is already on wall 2 and Isaacs's oil is on wall 4. However, Franz's oil cannot be on wall 2 because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, the only possible option is Greene's oil.

If Young is assigned parking space #5, then Xu must be assigned parking space #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #1. This leaves Togowa with parking space #2 and Vaughn with parking space #3. If Young is assigned parking space #6, then Xu must be assigned parking space #5, and Souza must be assigned parking space #1. This leaves Togowa with parking space #2 and Vaughn with parking space #3. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #4. This means that Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. If Young is assigned parking space #5, then Xu must be assigned parking space #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #1. This leaves Togowa with parking space #2 and Vaughn with parking space #3. If Young is assigned parking space #6, then Xu must be assigned parking space #5, and Souza must be assigned parking space #1. This leaves Togowa with parking space #2 and Vaughn with parking space #3. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
Response 9:

  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #4. This means that Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. If Young is assigned parking space #5, then Xu must be assigned parking space #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #1. This leaves Togowa with parking space #2 and Vaughn with parking space #3. If Young is assigned parking space #6, then Xu must be assigned parking space #5, and Souza must be assigned parking space #1. This leaves Togowa with parking space #2 and Vaughn with parking space #3. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we can deduce that:
  - The first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday or Tuesday.
  - The third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  - The second batch of the remaining kind of cookie is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which is either Tuesday or Wednesday.
  - The remaining batches of cookies can be arranged in any order that satisfies the given conditions.
  We need to find the statement that could be false based on the given conditions.
  
Solution:
  If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday, then the third batch of another kind of cookie can be made on Wednesday or Thursday. In either case, at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. Therefore, statement A is true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?
Choices:
  A: Quinn
  B: Ruiz
  C: Verma
  D: Wells
  E: Xue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" is not applicable.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint "If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be" is not applicable.
  So, we can consider the following cases:
  
  Case 1: Quinn is the project leader
    In this case, only Quinn and Ruiz can be project members. But, Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. 
    Therefore, Ruiz cannot be a project member. So, the project members are Quinn, Xue, and Wells.
  
  Case 2: Ruiz is the project leader
    In this case, only Quinn and Ruiz can be project members. Ruiz can be a project member because he is the leader. 
    Therefore, the project members are Ruiz, Xue, and Wells.
  
  In both cases, Wells is a project member. Therefore, the answer is D: Wells.

    Therefore, the project members are Ruiz, Xue, and Wells.
  
  In both cases, Wells is a project member. Therefore, the answer is D: Wells. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" is not applicable.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint "If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be" is not applicable.
  So, we can consider the following cases:
  
  Case 1: Quinn is the project leader
    In this case, only Quinn and Ruiz can be project members. But, Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. 
    Therefore, Ruiz cannot be a project member. So, the project members are Quinn, Xue, and Wells.
  
  Case 2: Ruiz is the project leader
    In this case, only Quinn and Ruiz can be project members. Ruiz can be a project member because he is the leader. 
    Therefore, the project members are Ruiz, Xue, and Wells.
  
  In both cases, Wells is a project member. Therefore, the answer is D: Wells.

Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Therefore, if the Sports section has one photograph by Fuentes and one photograph by Hue, then the Lifestyle section must also have one photograph by Fuentes and one photograph by Hue. This means that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, which is possible according to the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is E.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays

  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  We need to find a valid assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies, so Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the same ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, so Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies, so at most one of them can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.

Solution:
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the same ceremony, so we can assign them to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so we can assign him there.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies, so we cannot assign both of them to the Silva University ceremony.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has two targets, one for website and one for voicemail.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days.
  
  If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must also be 1 day, which violates the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target must be 3 days.
  
  Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 2 days. 
  
  Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?
Choices:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery

  E: the western, the sci-fi film
Response 0:

  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that the western movie is shown before the horror movie, and that screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M. Therefore, the western movie must be shown at 7 P.M. on either screen 1 or screen 2.

  Finally, we know that the sci-fi movie is not shown on screen 3. Therefore, the sci-fi movie must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2. 
  Based on these conditions, the only option that cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first, is option D: the western, the mystery.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that Gagnon's two photographs must be in the Metro and Sports sections. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, both of Gagnon's photographs must be in the Metro section. Therefore, we have one photograph in the Metro section by Gagnon, one photograph in the Metro section by either Fuentes or Hue, one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes, and one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Hue. This leaves two photographs for the Sports section, one by Fuentes and one by Hue, which satisfies the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, and the answer is (C).

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.

  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on a different shelf than I and M, because F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F must be on the top or middle shelf, and I and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf. However, we do not know where the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which shelf each book is placed on.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we do not know where any of the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which shelf each book is placed on.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must be on the same shelf as F and L, because F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F, L, and M must be on the same shelf, and I and K must be on the other shelf. However, we do not know where the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which shelf each book is placed on.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on the same shelf as M, because F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F, M, and H must be on the same shelf, and I, K, L, and O must be on the other two shelves. However, we do not know which shelf each of these books is placed on, so it is not fully determined which shelf each book is placed on.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that L and F must be on the same shelf as M, because F is on the same shelf as M and O is on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, F, L, M, and O must be on the same shelf, and I and K must be on the other two shelves.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that L and F must be on the same shelf as M, because F is on the same shelf as M and O is on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, F, L, M, and O must be on the same shelf, and I and K must be on the other two shelves. However, we do not know which shelf each of these books is placed on, so it is not fully determined which shelf each book is placed on.

Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.

  If H is sixth, then the order of the articles is not fully determined because we don't know the order of the first five articles.
  If R is fourth, then the order of the articles is fully determined because we know that the first three articles must be S, Q, and R (in that order), and we know that G must be earlier than R, so the order must be S, Q, R, G, J, H, Y.
  If R is seventh, then the order of the articles is not fully determined because we don't know the order of the first six articles.
  If Y is fifth, then the order of the articles is not fully determined because we don't know the order of the first four articles.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.
  E: The toy store is in space 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 4 or space 6.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in spaces 1 and 2 or spaces 6 and 7.
  - Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 6, and one of the restaurants must be in space 1.
  - The other restaurant cannot be in space 2, so it must be in space 4.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 3.
  - The shoe store must be in space 2 or space 7.
  - However, the optometrist must be next to the pharmacy, so the shoe store must be in space 7.

The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - There are six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Action: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, it means that there are only five students available for the project. 
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there are only four students available for the project. Since there are four years, each year must have one student assigned to it. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project (because if Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned). Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923 (because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923). If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922 (because if Mollie is assigned, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923). Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to either 1924 or 1922. If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Onyx must be assigned to 1921 (because Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, and Ryan is assigned to 1923). Therefore, this option is possible.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923 (because Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's). If Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project (because if Tiffany is not assigned, then Ryan cannot be assigned). Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922 (because if Mollie is not assigned, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923). If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922 (because Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, and Ryan is assigned to 1923). Therefore, this option is possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. M is published in the fall.
  2. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  3. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  4. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  5. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring (from 5 above). Therefore, K and N must be published in the spring (from 3 above). This means that O must be published in the spring (from 4 above). Since M and P cannot be published in the same season (from 2 above), P must be published in the spring. This leaves us with the following possible pairs of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M: K and O.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
Response 0:

If the shoe store is in space 4, then the optometrist and the veterinarian cannot be in spaces 3 and 5, because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 3 or 5, and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the shoe store is in space 4, it cannot be next to the pharmacy or the toy store. Therefore, the only option left is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, which means that B is the correct answer.

Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Solution:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it must have traded all of its buildings away. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded two class 2 buildings for either two class 3 buildings or one class 1 building and one class 3 building. 
  If Trustcorp traded two class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, then Southco must have traded a class 2 building for two class 2 buildings, which is not allowed. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded two class 2 buildings for one class 1 building and one class 3 building. 
  This means that RealProp must have traded a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, and Southco must have traded a class 1 building for a class 2 building. 
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is that RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Solution:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it must have traded all of its buildings away. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded two class 2 buildings for either two class 3 buildings or one class 1 building and one class 3 building. 
  If Trustcorp traded two class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, then Southco must have traded a class 2 building for two class 2 buildings, which is not allowed. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded two class 2 buildings for one class 1 building and one class 3 building. 
  This means that RealProp must have traded a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, and Southco must have traded a class 1 building for a class 2 building. 
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is that RealProp owns a class 1 building.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two.

Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.
  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.

  - Since Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, they cannot be featured on days 4-6.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation:

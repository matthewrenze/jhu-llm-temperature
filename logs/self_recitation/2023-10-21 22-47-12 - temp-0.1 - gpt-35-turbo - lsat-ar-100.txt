### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  5 students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review 1 or more of 3 plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so Megregian, Jiang, and Lopez must review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  If Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be Kramer or O'Neill.
  Therefore, the third student who reviews Undulation must be either Jiang, Lopez, or Megregian.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then both Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian, which means they both review only one play each, and neither of them can review Tamerlane, which contradicts the given information.
  If O'Neill reviews Undulation, then Kramer must review Sunset and Lopez must review Tamerlane, which means Megregian reviews only one play, which contradicts the given information.
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then Megregian must review Tamerlane and either Kramer or Lopez must review Sunset, which means the other one must review only one play, and that play cannot be Tamerlane, which contradicts the given information.
  Therefore, none of the above options could be true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.

  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  If Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be Kramer or O'Neill.
  If Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then Megregian must review Undulation.
  Jiang cannot review any play that Megregian reviews.
  
Action: Answer("C") - Jiang reviews Undulation.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.

  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must review Undulation.
  Megregian reviews at least one play that neither Kramer nor Lopez reviews, so Megregian must review Sunset or Undulation.
  
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation. (False, because if three students review Undulation, then Megregian must review either Undulation or Sunset.)
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. (True, because O'Neill reviews Tamerlane along with Kramer, and three students review Undulation.)
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation. (True, because if three students review Undulation, then Jiang must review Undulation.)
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. (False, because three students review Undulation, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.)

  If neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, then Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
  
  A: Megregian cannot review Undulation if exactly three students review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill can review Undulation if exactly three students review Undulation.
  C: Jiang cannot review Undulation if exactly three students review Undulation.
  D: Lopez cannot review Tamerlane because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill cannot review Sunset because O'Neill reviews Tamerlane.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three students review Undulation.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  - Since exactly three students review Undulation, the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the third student who reviews Tamerlane must be one of Jiang, Lopez, or Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must review Tamerlane if one of them reviews Tamerlane.
  - If Megregian reviews Tamerlane, then Kramer and O'Neill would be the two students who review the same play (Tamerlane), which contradicts the given condition that exactly two students review the same play.
  - Therefore, Megregian does not review Tamerlane, and Lopez must review Tamerlane.
  - Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, Megregian must review all three plays.
  
Action: Answer("C") - Jiang reviews Undulation.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  5 students review 1 or more of 3 plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  If Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then the third student who reviews Tamerlane must be either Jiang, Lopez, or Megregian.
  If Megregian reviews Tamerlane, then neither Kramer nor Lopez can review Tamerlane, which contradicts the given information.
  If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian cannot review Tamerlane, which contradicts the given information.
  If Jiang reviews Tamerlane, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Tamerlane, which contradicts the given information.
  Therefore, the third student who reviews Tamerlane must be one of Kramer or O'Neill.
  
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation. - This could be true.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. - This could be true.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation. - This could be true.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. - This cannot be true because we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. - This cannot be true because we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  - Three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Each student reviews one or more of the three plays.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the two remaining students must review the same play or plays as each other. 
  A: If Megregian does not review Undulation, then the two remaining students must review the same play or plays as each other. This would violate the condition that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then the two remaining students must review the same play or plays as each other. This would violate the condition that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation. This satisfies the condition that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. The two remaining students must review the same play or plays as each other. This satisfies the condition that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, C could be true.
  D: If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Kramer and O'Neill cannot review Tamerlane. This would violate the condition that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, D is not true.
  E: If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer must review Undulation and Lopez must review Tamerlane. This would violate the condition that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, E is not true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot be part of the three students who review Undulation.
  Therefore, the three students who review Undulation are Jiang, Lopez, and Megregian.
  Megregian reviews fewer plays than Kramer and Lopez, so he cannot review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, O'Neill must review Undulation, and he cannot review Sunset.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Solution:
  The Flores Tower is the only class 1 building owned by any of the companies, so it cannot be traded for two class 3 buildings. 
  The King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building are all class 2 buildings, so they cannot be traded for two class 3 buildings. 
  Therefore, the only possible trade involving a class 1 building is trading the Flores Tower for two class 2 buildings. 
  This means that Southco must trade the Flores Tower for two class 2 buildings, and the only other class 2 buildings are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade one of those buildings for the Flores Tower. 
  The only class 1 building left is the Garza Tower, so RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower. 
  This leaves RealProp with the Yates House and the Zimmer House, and Trustcorp with the King Building and the Meyer Building. 
  Therefore, the answer is (D) RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House; Southco: the Lynch Building and the Flores Tower; Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  After only one trade is made, each company will still own three buildings.
  
Analysis:
  Option A is not possible because RealProp would have two class 1 buildings after the trade.
  Option B is not possible because Trustcorp would have only one class 2 building after the trade.
  Option C is not possible because RealProp would have only one class 1 building after the trade.
  Option D is not possible because RealProp would have two class 1 buildings after the trade.
  Option E is possible because each company would still own three buildings, and the trade could have been made in the following way:
    - RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) and the King Building (class 2).
    - Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3).
    - Trustcorp trades the Ortiz Building (class 2) for the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).

  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  The Garza Tower is the only class 1 building, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The Flores Tower is the only other class 1 building, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The King Building is the only class 2 building owned by Trustcorp that can be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is between RealProp and Southco, with RealProp trading the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Solution:
  The Flores Tower is the only class 1 building owned by any of the companies, so it cannot be traded for two class 3 buildings. Therefore, the Flores Tower must be traded for either one building of the same class or two class 2 buildings. 
  If the Flores Tower is traded for one building of the same class, then the only option is to trade it for the Garza Tower. This means that RealProp would own both class 1 buildings, which is not possible since each company can only own one building of each class. Therefore, the Flores Tower must be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The only class 2 building owned by Southco is the Lynch Building, so it must be one of the buildings traded for the Flores Tower. This means that Trustcorp must trade two of its class 2 buildings for the Flores Tower. The only two class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp are the King Building and the Ortiz Building, so those must be the buildings traded for the Flores Tower.
  This leaves RealProp with the Garza Tower and two class 3 buildings, and Trustcorp with the Lynch Building and two class 3 buildings. Therefore, the answer is:

  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  RealProp has one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  In order to make a trade, each company must trade one of their buildings for another building of the same class, or trade one of their class 1 buildings for two class 2 buildings, or trade one of their class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  After one trade, each company will still have one building, but the class of the building may change.

Solution:
  Option A is not possible because RealProp would have two class 1 buildings after the trade.
  Option B is not possible because Trustcorp would have two class 3 buildings after the trade.
  Option C is possible because each company can trade one building for another building of the same class.
  Option D is not possible because RealProp would have two class 2 buildings after the trade.

Solution:
  We need to find a combination of trades that satisfies the given conditions. Let's try to eliminate the options that are not possible:
  - Option A: RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) owned by Southco. This is not possible because Southco does not have any class 3 building to trade with RealProp.
  - Option B: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the King Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2) owned by Trustcorp. This is not possible because RealProp cannot trade a class 3 building for two class 2 buildings.
  - Option C: RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Lynch Building (class 2) owned by Southco, and Trustcorp trades the King Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3) owned by RealProp. This is a valid combination of trades that satisfies the given conditions.
  - Option D: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the Meyer Building (class 2) owned by Trustcorp, and Trustcorp trades the Ortiz Building (class 2) for the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Zimmer House (class 3) owned by RealProp. This is not possible because RealProp cannot trade a class 3 building for a class 2 building.
  - Option E: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the Flores Tower (class 1) owned by Southco, and Trustcorp trades the King Building (class 2) for the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Zimmer House (class 3) owned by RealProp. This is not possible because RealProp cannot trade a class 3 building for a class 1 building.

  Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Solution:
  The Flores Tower is the only class 1 building owned by any of the companies, so it cannot be traded for two class 3 buildings. Therefore, the Flores Tower must be traded for either one building of the same class or two class 2 buildings. 
  If the Flores Tower is traded for one building of the same class, then the only option is to trade it for the Garza Tower, which is the only other class 1 building. This means that RealProp would own the Flores Tower and the Yates House and Zimmer House (both class 3), while Southco would own the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building (both class 2), and Trustcorp would own the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building (all class 2). This option is not among the choices.
  Therefore, the Flores Tower must be traded for two class 2 buildings. The only company that owns two class 2 buildings is Trustcorp. Therefore, the Flores Tower must be traded for the King Building and the Ortiz Building. This means that RealProp would own the Garza Tower and the Yates House and Zimmer House (both class 3), while Southco would own the Lynch Building (class 2), and Trustcorp would own the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building (all class 2). 
  The only option that matches this configuration is (D).

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then:
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, so W must be mentioned in chapter 6 or later.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.

Analysis of each choice:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1. This is possible, but we cannot determine the placement of T, W, S, Z, or X.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5. This is possible, and we can determine the placement of T, W, S, Z, and X based on the constraints. Answer("B").
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7. This is possible, but we cannot determine the placement of T, W, R, Z, or X.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6. This is possible, and we can determine the placement of T, R, S, Z, and X based on the constraints. Answer("D").
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4. This is not possible, because we already determined that X must be mentioned in chapter 4 as a result of U being mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, this choice is not valid. Answer("None of the Above").
Response 1:

  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, X cannot be mentioned in chapter 5, so X must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.
  
  - If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 5, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 7, which is allowed.
  - If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5, which is allowed.
  - If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 7, which is allowed.
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5, which is allowed.

  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: 
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 6 and 7.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W and X cannot be mentioned in chapters 3 and 4 or in chapters 4 and 5.
  
  - If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6. This violates the constraint that T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6. This satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the answer is (B) R is mentioned in chapter 5. 

Answer: Answer("B")

  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 1-5 and 3-7, respectively.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W and X must be mentioned in chapters 4-7 and 3-6, respectively.

Action: Answer("D")  
  - If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and W must be mentioned in chapter 6. This satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, W could be mentioned in chapter 6. None of the other choices satisfy all the constraints.

Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 

Using condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and D because they only have one student reviewing Tamerlane.

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, we can eliminate option E because it includes Lopez and O'Neill, who both review plays that Jiang could have reviewed.

Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, we can eliminate option C because it includes all three of them reviewing Tamerlane, which would mean that Megregian reviews all three plays, which violates condition 3.

Action: Answer("B")  
Option B is the only remaining option, which includes Kramer and O'Neill reviewing Tamerlane.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
  From condition 3, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, the other student who reviews Tamerlane must be one of the students who reviews the same play or plays as another student.
  From condition 4, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian must review all three plays, and Kramer and Lopez each review only one or two plays.
  From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
  
Solution:
  The only possible pair of students who review the same play or plays are Kramer and O'Neill, who both review Tamerlane. Therefore, the answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

  From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
  
Solution:
  The only possible pair of students who review the same play or plays are Kramer and O'Neill, who both review Tamerlane. Therefore, the answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.

  From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So, any option that does not include both Kramer and O'Neill can be eliminated.
  From condition 4, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. So, any option that includes Megregian but not Lopez and Kramer can be eliminated.
  From condition 3, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. So, any option that includes more than three students can be eliminated.
  From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So, any option that includes Jiang can be eliminated.

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, we can eliminate option E because it includes Lopez and O'Neill, who both review plays that Jiang may have reviewed.

Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, we can eliminate option C because it includes all three students reviewing Tamerlane, which would mean that Megregian reviews all three plays, contradicting condition 3.

Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 

Using condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, the other student(s) who review Tamerlane must be one of the students who review the same play or plays as each other.

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot be one of the students who review Tamerlane.

Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian must review all three plays, and Kramer and Lopez must each review only one of the three plays.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing is three days long: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday, and Hong cannot testify on Tuesday. This means that Hong must testify on Wednesday, and Iturbe is the only witness who can testify with Hong. Therefore, Iturbe must testify on Tuesday, and the two witnesses who testify on Tuesday are Iturbe and Jackson. This leaves Franco and Garcia to testify on Monday. Since Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, Garcia must testify on Wednesday. Therefore, the only option that must be true is C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing is three days long: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  - If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Franco or Hong.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco, Garcia, Hong, and Jackson must testify on Monday and Tuesday.
  - Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, then Franco and Garcia must testify on Monday, and Hong and Jackson must testify on Tuesday.
  - Therefore, Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  - The correct answer must be consistent with this analysis.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing is three days long: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

  - Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday, because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, which contradicts the condition that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday.
  
  If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Hong cannot testify on Tuesday, because Franco and Hong cannot testify on the same day. Therefore, Hong must testify on Monday or Wednesday. However, if Hong testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, which contradicts the condition that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Monday.
  
  If Hong testifies on Monday and Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia must testify on Wednesday, because Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Franco or Hong. Therefore, Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  
  Answer: C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing takes exactly 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, which contradicts the condition that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday.
  
  If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday or Wednesday. However, if Garcia testifies on Monday, then there would be no witnesses left to testify on Wednesday, which contradicts the condition that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Wednesday.
  
  If Franco testifies on Tuesday and Garcia testifies on Wednesday, then Hong must testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Jackson and Iturbe must testify on Tuesday. This satisfies all of the conditions.
  
Action: Answer("C")

  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, which contradicts the condition that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday. Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Hong must also testify on Tuesday. Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday and Iturbe must testify on Wednesday.

  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Wednesday. Iturbe also testifies on Wednesday, so Iturbe and Franco are the two witnesses who testify on Wednesday. Garcia cannot testify on Monday because at least one witness must testify on Monday and Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Tuesday. Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Jackson must also testify on Tuesday. This leaves Hong to testify on Monday.

  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday because Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday.
  
  If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday or Wednesday. However, if Garcia testifies on Monday, then there would be no witnesses left to testify on Tuesday because exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Wednesday.
  
  If Franco testifies on Tuesday and Garcia testifies on Wednesday, then Hong must testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Jackson must testify on Tuesday because there are no other witnesses left to testify on Tuesday. Finally, Iturbe must testify on Wednesday because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  
  The schedule is:
  Monday: Hong
  Tuesday: Franco, Jackson
  Wednesday: Garcia, Iturbe

  E: Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is consistent with the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. However, Xu is assigned parking space #5, which violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, E is not a valid assignment.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The rules state that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #4. 
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, and Young must be assigned parking space #6. 
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3, and Xu must be assigned parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6. 
Action: Answer("D")  
  The only option that satisfies all of the rules is option D: 
  #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The rules state that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #4. 
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so Young cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6. 
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2. 
  Each employee must be assigned a different parking space. 
  Using these rules, we can eliminate some of the answer choices. 
  A: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so this assignment is not possible. 
  B: This assignment violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
  C: This assignment is possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach:
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so Nessa's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so their sessions must be on Wednesday or Thursday.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan's session must be on Wednesday or Friday.
  - We can determine the sessions for Nessa, Kevin, and Rebecca, so the answer is 3.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then:
  1. Julio's session is already assigned.
  2. Olivia's session must be on Friday (since Julio's session must be on an earlier day than Olivia's).
  3. Nessa's session must be on Thursday afternoon (since Nessa must lead an afternoon session).
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and that day cannot be Thursday (since Nessa is already leading the Thursday afternoon session). Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Wednesday or Friday.
  5. Lan cannot lead a session on Thursday (since Nessa is already leading the Thursday afternoon session), so Lan must lead a session on Wednesday or Friday.
  
  Therefore, the only lab assistant whose session cannot be determined is Lan. The other five lab assistants have their sessions determined.
  
Action: Answer("B")

  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the following:
  1. Julio's session is on Thursday afternoon.
  2. Olivia's session is on Friday (since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's).
  3. Lan's session is on Wednesday (since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day).
  4. Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon (since Nessa must lead an afternoon session).
  5. Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on Wednesday and Thursday morning (since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day).
  
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions for five of the lab assistants: Julio, Olivia, Lan, Nessa, and either Kevin or Rebecca. We cannot determine the session for the remaining lab assistant.

  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the following:
  - Julio's session is on Thursday afternoon.
  - Olivia's session is on Friday (since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's).
  - Nessa's session is on Wednesday afternoon (since Nessa must lead an afternoon session and there is only one afternoon session left).
  
  We cannot determine the sessions for Kevin, Lan, and Rebecca yet, since there are multiple possibilities that satisfy the given constraints.

  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the following:
  1. Julio's session is on Thursday afternoon.
  2. Olivia's session is on Friday (because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's).
  3. Nessa's session is on Wednesday (because Nessa must lead an afternoon session and there is only one afternoon session on Wednesday).
  4. Lan's session cannot be on Thursday (because Olivia's session is on Friday and Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day), so Lan's session must be on Wednesday morning.
  5. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and there is only one day left (Thursday), so Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on Thursday (one in the morning and one in the afternoon).
  
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions for all of the lab assistants except for one.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are 6 lab sessions: 3 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon.

  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  6. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  7. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Solution:
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon. By rule 6, Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning. By rule 5, Lan's session must be on Thursday morning and Kevin's session must be on Friday morning. Nessa's session must be on Thursday afternoon. Rebecca's session can only be on Friday afternoon. Therefore, we can determine the sessions led by all lab assistants except for Rebecca. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then:
  - Julio's session is already determined.
  - Olivia's session must be on Friday (because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's).
  - Nessa's session must be on Thursday afternoon (because Nessa must lead an afternoon session).
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, but they cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session (because Nessa is leading that session). Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday or Friday afternoon sessions.
  - Lan's session can be on Wednesday morning or Friday morning.
  
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions for five of the lab assistants: Julio, Nessa, Olivia, and either Kevin or Rebecca, and either Lan's Wednesday morning session or Lan's Friday morning session.

Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the following:
  - Julio's session is on Thursday afternoon.
  - Olivia's session is on Friday (because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's).
  - Nessa's session is on Wednesday afternoon (because Nessa must lead an afternoon session and there is only one afternoon session left).
  - Lan's session is on Thursday morning (because Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day and Olivia's session is on Friday).
  
  We know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, but we don't know which day that is. Therefore, we cannot determine which sessions they lead. 
  
  That leaves us with two lab assistants whose sessions we can determine: Julio and Lan. Therefore, the answer is B: two.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina
  C: Irving and Robert
  D: Kyle and Nina
  E: Olivia and Kyle
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a table to keep track of which students can give reports on which days and in which time slots. 

| Day       | Morning   | Afternoon |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Monday    |           |           |
| Tuesday   | George    |           |
| Wednesday |           |           |

From the given conditions, we know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Therefore, they must give morning reports on Monday and Wednesday. 

| Day       | Morning   | Afternoon |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Monday    | Olivia    | Robert    |
| Tuesday   | George    |           |
| Wednesday | Robert    | Olivia    |

If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, we can consider two cases: 

Case 1: Nina gives a report on Tuesday. 
In this case, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Kyle and Lenore must give reports on Monday. 

| Day       | Morning   | Afternoon |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Monday    | Kyle      | Lenore    |
| Tuesday   | George    | Nina      |
| Wednesday | Helen     | Irving    |

Case 2: Nina does not give a report on Tuesday. 
In this case, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Kyle and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday. 

| Day       | Morning   | Afternoon |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Monday    | Olivia    | Robert    |
| Tuesday   | Helen     | Irving    |
| Wednesday | Kyle      | Lenore    |

Now we can answer the question. 
If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are Helen and Irving. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  1. Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  2. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  3. Since exactly two reports will be given each day, and George can only give a report on Tuesday, then George must be paired with one of the students who will give a report on Wednesday.
  4. Since Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, then they must give reports in the morning.
  5. Since exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days, then two students will not give reports.
  
Solution:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot be paired with any student who will give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  2. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina cannot be paired with Helen or Irving on Wednesday.
  3. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina must be paired with one of the students who will give a report on Wednesday.
  4. Since Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, then they must give reports in the morning. Therefore, they cannot be paired with any student who will give a report in the afternoon.
  5. Since exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days, then two students will not give reports. Therefore, the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are the only two students left who have not been paired with anyone else.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a table to keep track of which students can give reports on which days and in which time slots. 

| Day       | Morning   | Afternoon |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Monday    | Kyle      | Lenore    |
| Monday    | Irving    | Helen     |
| Tuesday   | George    | Nina      |
| Tuesday   | Olivia    | Robert    |
| Wednesday | Nina      |           |
| Wednesday | Helen/Irving | Kyle/Olivia |

From the table, we can see that if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Helen gives a report on the same day as Nina, she must give it on Wednesday. Similarly, if Irving gives a report on the same day as Nina, he must give it on Wednesday. Therefore, the pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday are Helen and Nina. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a table to keep track of which students can give reports on which days and in which time slots:

| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Monday      | ? | ? |
| Tuesday      | George | ? |
| Wednesday | ? | ? |

From the given conditions, we know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports. Also, George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must give a morning report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then no one needs to give a report on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then no one needs to give a report on Monday. 

| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Monday      | Nina | Robert |
| Tuesday      | George | Helen, Irving |
| Wednesday | Olivia, Kyle | Lenore |

Now we can see which pairs of students must give reports on Wednesday. The only pair that is scheduled to give reports on Wednesday is Olivia and Kyle.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

To determine which pair of students must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other, we need to consider the conditions that limit which students can give reports on Wednesday. 

Analysis:
  1. George must give his report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give their reports in the morning.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Since exactly two reports are given each day, and six students give reports, two students will not give reports on any given day.

Let's consider each option:
  A. George and Lenore: George must give his report on Tuesday, so he cannot give his report on Wednesday. Lenore could give her report on Wednesday, but there is no condition that requires her to give her report on Wednesday. Therefore, this pair does not have to give reports on Wednesday.
  B. Helen and Nina: If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday. If Helen gives her report on Tuesday, then Nina must give her report on Wednesday. Therefore, if Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday.
  C. Irving and Robert: Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so he must give his report in the morning. Irving could give his report on Wednesday, but there is no condition that requires him to give his report on Wednesday. Therefore, this pair does not have to give reports on Wednesday.
  D. Kyle and Nina: If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday. If Kyle gives his report on Tuesday, then Nina must give her report on Wednesday. Therefore, if Kyle and Nina give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday.
  E. Olivia and Kyle: Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so she must give her report in the morning. Kyle could give his report on Wednesday, but there is no condition that requires him to give his report on Wednesday. Therefore, this pair does not have to give reports on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
To determine the answer, we need to use the given conditions to create a schedule for the three days and see which pairs of students must give reports on Wednesday.

Schedule:
Monday: 
Morning: 
Afternoon: 

Tuesday: 
Morning: George
Afternoon: 

Wednesday: 
Morning: 
Afternoon: 

From the schedule, we can see that if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are Helen and Irving.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
To determine which pair of students must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other, we need to consider the following:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot be part of the pair.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they cannot be part of the pair.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, leaving only Lenore and Kyle to give reports on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Wednesday, leaving Nina and another student to give reports on Wednesday.
  4. This leaves us with the following possible pairs of students who can give reports on Wednesday: 
    - Helen and Irving (if Nina gives a report on Monday)
    - Nina and another student (if Nina gives a report on Wednesday)
    - Lenore and Kyle (if Nina gives a report on Monday)
    
Action: Answer("B") - Helen and Nina.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
To determine which pair of students must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other, we need to consider the conditions that force students to give reports on Wednesday. The only condition that forces students to give reports on Wednesday is if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, we need to find a pair of students that includes Nina and one of the students who must give a report on Wednesday if Nina gives a report on Tuesday.

Analysis:
  * George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  * Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  * If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  * Therefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday.
  * If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
  * Therefore, the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other must include Nina and either Helen or Irving.
  * The only pair of students that includes Nina and either Helen or Irving is Helen and Nina.

Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Therefore, they can only give reports in the morning.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Therefore, if two students give reports on the same day, they must give reports in the morning and afternoon respectively.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, if Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Helen and Nina are the pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday.

  3. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, because there will be no next day to follow.
  4. If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Monday.
  5. Since exactly two reports will be given each day, and Nina must give a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  6. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  7. The remaining students who have not been assigned a day to give a report are: George, Lenore, Kyle, Olivia, and Robert.
  8. Since Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, they must give reports in the morning.
  9. Therefore, the only possible pairs of students who can give reports on Wednesday are: George and Lenore, Helen and Nina, and Kyle and Olivia.
  10. Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, George and Lenore cannot give reports on Wednesday.
  11. Since Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, Helen cannot give a report on Monday. Therefore, Helen and Nina cannot give reports on Wednesday.
  12. Since Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, she must give a report in the morning. Therefore, Kyle and Olivia cannot give reports on the same day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist. If G is selected, then K cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected. If K is not selected, then A is not true. If L is selected, then F can still be selected, so B is not true. If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be either L or M, so C is not true. If exactly two chemists are selected, then they must be L and M, and F can still be selected, so D is not true. If exactly two chemists are selected, then they must be L and M, and G can still be selected, so E is not true.
Action: Answer("None of the above")

  A: If K is selected, then M cannot be selected. There is no information about G in this case.
  B: If L is selected, then K and M cannot be selected. There is no information about F in this case.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it could be any of the three chemists. There is no information about K being the only chemist selected.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then one of them cannot be K or M. There is no information about F in this case.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then one of them cannot be K or M. There is no information about G in this case.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and either K or L must be selected as a chemist. M cannot be selected because if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, which would violate the condition that P is the only zoologist selected.
  
Analysis:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. G can be selected as a botanist even if K is selected as a chemist.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. F can be selected as a botanist even if L is selected as a chemist.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. - This is not necessarily true. Either K or L can be selected as a chemist.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. - This is true. If exactly two chemists are selected, they must be K and L. In this case, either F or G must be selected as a botanist. However, if F is selected, then there can be at most one zoologist selected, which would violate the condition that P is the only zoologist selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. G can be selected as a botanist even if exactly two chemists are selected.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:

  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist. If G is selected, then no zoologist other than P can be selected. If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, and it must be P. Therefore, we know that either F or G is selected, and that P is the only zoologist selected. 
  
  A: We do not have enough information to determine whether this statement is true or false.
  B: We do not have enough information to determine whether this statement is true or false.
  C: We do not have enough information to determine whether this statement is true or false.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then either K and L are selected, or L and M are selected. If K and L are selected, then F and P must also be selected. If L and M are selected, then either F or G must be selected, and it must be the case that P and R are also selected. In either case, F cannot be excluded if exactly two chemists are selected. Therefore, this statement is false.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then either K and L are selected, or L and M are selected. If K and L are selected, then F and P must also be selected. If L and M are selected, then either F or G must be selected, and it must be the case that P and R are also selected. In either case, G cannot be excluded if exactly two chemists are selected. Therefore, this statement is false.

  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist. If G is selected, then K cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected. If K is not selected, then A is not true. If L is selected, then F can still be selected, so B is not true. If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be either L or M, so C is not true. If exactly two chemists are selected, then they must be L and M, and F can still be selected, so D is not true. If exactly two chemists are selected, then they must be L and M, and G can still be selected, so E is not true.

  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and either K, L, or M must be selected as a chemist. 

Analysis of choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. G can be selected even if K is selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. F can be selected even if L is selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. - This is not necessarily true. L or M can be selected instead of K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. - This is true. If exactly two chemists are selected, they must be any two of K, L, and M. If F is selected as a botanist, then there will be more than one botanist and at most one zoologist, which violates the given conditions.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. G can be selected even if exactly two chemists are selected.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and either K or L must be selected as a chemist. M cannot be selected because if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, which would violate the condition that P is the only zoologist selected.

Analysis:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. It is possible to select K and G together if F is not selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. It is possible to select L and F together if G is not selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. - This is not necessarily true. It is possible to select L or M as the only chemist selected.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. - This is true. If exactly two chemists are selected, they must be K and L or K and M. In either case, F cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. It is possible to select K and L as the two chemists and also select G as a botanist.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and either K, L, or M must be selected as a chemist.
  
  Let's analyze each option:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. There is no direct relationship between K and G. This option is not necessarily true.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. There is no direct relationship between L and F. This option is not necessarily true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. This option is not necessarily true. We can have either K or L as the only chemist selected.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. This option is true. If F is selected, then we must select either K or L as the second chemist. But if we select K, then we cannot select G as the botanist. Therefore, if F is selected, we must select L as the second chemist.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. This option is not necessarily true. We can have either K or L as one of the chemists, and then select G as the other chemist.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:

  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, then M cannot be selected. There is no restriction on selecting G if K is selected. This statement is not necessarily true.
  B: If L is selected, then K and M cannot be selected. There is no restriction on selecting F if L is selected. This statement is not necessarily true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, then it must be K. This statement is true because K is the only chemist that can be selected if at least one scientist of each type is selected and P is the only zoologist selected.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then F cannot be selected. This statement is not necessarily true because F can be selected if only one botanist is selected and P is the only zoologist selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then G cannot be selected. This statement is not necessarily true because G can be selected if only one botanist is selected and P is the only zoologist selected.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, then there would be 2 sales representatives in that zone, and the remaining 5 sales representatives would have to be split between Zone 2 and Zone 3. However, since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, this is not possible. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3, and Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, respectively. This would mean that Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey are the remaining sales representatives in Zone 3, which is not possible because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, they cannot work in Zones 1 or 2. Therefore, they must work in Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3. Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Tiao cannot work in Zone 3. Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao cannot work in Zone 3, Parra must work in Zone 1. Since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, and Udall cannot work in Zone 3, Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 3. Therefore, Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well. 
  Since Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, the answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:

  B: Mahr is not mentioned in relation to Quinn, so it is possible for Quinn to work in the same sales zone as Mahr.
  C: Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so it is not possible for Quinn to work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  D: Tiao is mentioned in the conditions, but there is no direct conflict between Quinn and Tiao working in the same sales zone.
  E: Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so it is not possible for Quinn to work in the same sales zone as Udall.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3, and Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, respectively. This would mean that Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey are the remaining sales representatives in Zone 3, which is not possible because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a sales representative who cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra also works in Zone 1, which means Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 3. This would leave Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey to work in Zone 3, which would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then Tiao also works in Zone 2, which means Parra works in Zone 1, and Udall works in Zone 3. This would leave Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey to work in Zone 3, which would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then Stuckey and Udall also work in Zone 3, which means Parra works in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 2. This would leave Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 2, which satisfies all the conditions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, then there would be 2 sales representatives in that zone, and the remaining 5 sales representatives would have to be divided between the other two zones. However, since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, this would not be possible. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra. 
  
  A: Kim's sales zone is unknown and not relevant to the question.
  B: Mahr's sales zone is unknown and not relevant to the question.
  C: Stuckey and Quinn can work in the same sales zone, so Stuckey is not the answer.
  D: If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 3, which means that Parra must work in Zone 1. In this case, Quinn would have to work in the same sales zone as Mahr, which is possible since there are 3 sales representatives left to be divided between Zone 1 and the sales zone where Stuckey works. Therefore, D is not the answer.
  E: If Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then Parra must work in Zone 1 and Tiao must work in Zone 2. In this case, Quinn would have to work in the same sales zone as Kim and Mahr, which is possible since there are 2 sales representatives left to be divided between Zone 1 and the sales zone where Udall and Stuckey work. Therefore, E is not the answer.

  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, then there would be at most 2 sales representatives in that zone (Parra and Quinn). This would mean that there would be at most 2 sales representatives in each of the other two zones, which would contradict the fact that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra. 
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Tiao, then there would be at most 2 sales representatives in that zone (Quinn and Tiao).

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session?
Choices:
  A: Julio, Nessa
  B: Kevin, Rebecca
  C: Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  E: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Rebecca
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  The lab assistant who leads the Thursday afternoon session cannot be Lan or Olivia.
  
  From the given information, we know that Kevin's session is on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday. Also, Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so neither of them can lead the Thursday afternoon session. Therefore, the lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Kevin and Rebecca.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.

  5. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  6. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day.
  
  We know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, they must be assigned to either Wednesday or Thursday. We also know that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must be assigned to either Thursday or Friday. If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin and Rebecca must be assigned to Wednesday, and Nessa must be assigned to Thursday. This means that Julio's session must be on Wednesday, and Olivia's session must be on Friday. Lan cannot be assigned to Thursday because Olivia is already assigned to that day. Therefore, Lan must be assigned to Friday. This leaves only one lab assistant available for the Thursday afternoon session, which is Julio.

Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be:
  Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White
  
  Therefore, Stanton cannot have been recruited third or fifth, because in either case, he would have been immediately before or after Tao.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), Villas, White, and Stanton must be one of the two unknowns.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then Tao must have been recruited second, and Peters must have been recruited fourth, which is not possible.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then Tao must have been recruited first, and Peters must have been recruited fourth, which is possible.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then Tao must have been recruited first, and Peters must have been recruited fourth, which is possible.
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then Tao must have been recruited sixth, and Peters must have been recruited fourth, which is not possible.
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then Tao must have been recruited sixth, and Peters must have been recruited fourth, which is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), Villas, White. 
  Stanton cannot be recruited immediately before or after Tao, so he must be recruited either first, second, third, fifth, or seventh.
  
Analysis:
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of recruitment would be Stanton, Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White. This is not possible because Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Stanton, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White. This is not possible because Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, (unknown), Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White. This is possible.
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Villas, White. This is not possible because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, Stanton. This is not possible because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.

  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform a solo before the keyboard player does. This means that the percussionist must perform the first or second solo. The violinist must perform a solo before the keyboard player does, so the violinist cannot perform the last solo. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform the third solo. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform the fifth or sixth solo. If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist must perform the sixth solo, which violates the condition that the guitarist performs the third solo. Therefore, the percussionist must perform the second solo. This means that the violinist must perform the first solo, and the saxophonist must perform the fifth solo.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  7. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor on wall 2 because that would mean that wall 2 has only Hidalgo's work. We also cannot have Isaacs's oil or watercolor on wall 2 because that would mean that wall 2 has both Isaacs's and Hidalgo's work. We also cannot have Franz's oil on wall 2 because that would mean that wall 2 has both Franz's and Hidalgo's work. Therefore, the only option left is Greene's oil or watercolor. According to condition 5, if Franz's oil is on a wall, then Greene's watercolor is also on that wall. Therefore, if Hidalgo's oil is on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor must be on wall 1, and Greene's oil must be on wall 2.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  7. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor on wall 2 because that would violate condition 2. We also cannot have Isaacs's oil or watercolor on wall 2 because that would violate condition 4. We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so we can conclude that Franz's oil is displayed on either wall 1 or wall 3. Therefore, we can have Greene's oil on wall 2, which satisfies all the conditions.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  7. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we know that the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's oil or Hidalgo's watercolor. Also, since no wall can have only one student's work, we know that the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's other painting. Therefore, the other painting on wall 2 must be one of the paintings by the other three students. 
  
  According to condition 4, no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, we know that the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Franz's oil or Isaacs's watercolor. 
  
  According to condition 5, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Since Franz's oil is not on wall 2, we know that the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Greene's watercolor. Therefore, the other painting on wall 2 must be either Greene's oil or Isaacs's oil.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor, in the upper and lower positions.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning: 
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, the other painting on wall 2 must be an oil painting. This means that either Franz's oil or Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 2, since Hidalgo's oil is already on wall 2. However, we know that no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, so if Franz's oil is already on wall 2, then neither of his other paintings can be on wall 2. Similarly, if Greene's watercolor is already on wall 1, then neither of his other paintings can be on wall 2. This leaves us with only one possible option for the other painting on wall 2: Greene's oil.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  7. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we know that the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor. This means that neither Hidalgo's watercolor nor Isaacs's watercolor can be on wall 2. We also know that no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, so we can eliminate D and E. Since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, we can eliminate Hidalgo's watercolor as an option. We also know that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so we can eliminate Franz's oil as an option. This leaves us with only one possible answer:

  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  7. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we know that the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor. 
  We also know that no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, so there must be an oil painting on wall 2 as well. 
  Since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, we know that the other painting on wall 2 cannot be painted by Hidalgo. 
  Since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, we know that neither Franz's oil nor Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on wall 2. 
  From condition 5, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Franz's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 3. 
  Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, we know that the other painting on wall 1 or wall 3 must be an oil painting. 
  Since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, we know that the other painting on wall 1 or wall 3 cannot be painted by Hidalgo, Franz, or Isaacs. 
  Therefore, the only possible painting that could also be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  7. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we know that the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor. This means that neither of Franz's paintings can be on wall 2, since he has an oil painting that must be displayed with a watercolor. We also know that Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4, so his watercolor cannot be on wall 2. This leaves us with Greene's oil and Hidalgo's watercolor as the only possible options for wall 2.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  7. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor on wall 2 because that would violate condition 2. We also cannot have Isaacs's oil or watercolor on wall 2 because that would violate condition 4. We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so we can conclude that Franz's oil is displayed on either wall 1 or wall 3. Therefore, we can have Greene's oil on wall 2, which satisfies all the given conditions.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.

  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  7. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we know that the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor. This means that neither Hidalgo's watercolor nor Isaacs's watercolor can be on wall 2. We also know that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so Franz's oil cannot be on wall 2. However, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so if Franz's oil is not on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 either. This leaves us with only one possible option: Greene's oil. Therefore, the answer is (C) Greene's oil.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor, in the upper and lower positions.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning: 
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor. Since no wall can have only watercolors, there must be an oil painting by another student on wall 2. The oil painting cannot be by Franz or Isaacs, since neither of their paintings can be on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. The oil painting cannot be by Hidalgo, since Hidalgo's oil is already on wall 2. Therefore, the oil painting on wall 2 must be by Greene. Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, it cannot be on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. Therefore, Greene's oil must be the other painting on wall 2.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then which one of the following could be true of this evening's schedule?
Choices:
  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - There are three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.

  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must be shown before the sci-fi film. This means that the western cannot be shown on screen 3, since there is only one movie shown on that screen, and it is shown at 8 P.M. Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2.
  
  A: The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2, since the romance is not shown on that screen.
  B: The mystery cannot begin at 9 P.M., since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  C: The romance cannot be shown on screen 3, since the sci-fi film is not shown on that screen.
  D: The sci-fi film cannot begin at 7 P.M., since the western begins before the horror film.
  E: The western cannot begin at 8 P.M., since there is only one movie shown on screen 3, and it is shown at 8 P.M.

  If the western is shown on screen 1, then the horror film must be shown on screen 2, and the mystery must be shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M. The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 3 at 8 P.M. Therefore, the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1, so it must be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. This means that the mystery must be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M. Therefore, none of the choices are true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then:
  - H cannot be on the top shelf because that would mean L is on the top shelf, which is not possible.
  - H cannot be on the same shelf as L because that would mean L is not on a higher shelf than H.
  - Therefore, H must be on the middle shelf with I and L must be on the bottom shelf with at least 3 other books.
  - F and M are on the same shelf, but it is not clear which shelf that is.
  - G, K, and O are on the remaining shelf or shelves.
  
Analysis of choices:
  A: It is not clear where F and G are placed, so this choice cannot be determined.
  B: It is not clear where G is placed, so this choice cannot be determined.
  C: H is on the middle shelf with I, but it is not clear where M is placed, so this choice cannot be determined.
  D: It is not clear where G and I are placed, so this choice cannot be determined.
  E: K and O are on the remaining shelf or shelves, so this choice is possible.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, then K and M must be on the top shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, then G and O must be on the middle shelf. Therefore, the only answer choice that must be true is that H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf if L is on the middle shelf, or on the top or middle shelf if L is on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on the same shelf as O, and the only choice that reflects this is E.
  Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf if L is on the middle shelf, or on the top or middle shelf if L is on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on the same shelf as O, and the answer is E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other. Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf if L is on the middle shelf, or on the middle shelf if L is on the bottom shelf. However, this violates the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, it is impossible for L to be on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on. None of the choices are true. Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, K and M must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle shelf. Therefore, G and H must be on the bottom shelf together. The only option that reflects this is (B) G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other. Answer("B").
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. This means that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so I must be on the middle or top shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, K and M must be on the top shelf. This leaves G and O to be on the bottom shelf, and since O is on a higher shelf than L, G must be on the same shelf as L. Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, then K and M must be on the top shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, then G and O must be on the middle shelf. Therefore, the only answer choice that must be true is that H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other (choice C).
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and K must be on the middle shelf. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, F must be on the bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, M must also be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, G and H must be on the middle shelf. Since I is already on the middle shelf, we can conclude that I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other. Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf if L is on the middle shelf, or on the middle shelf if L is on the bottom shelf. However, we know that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so L cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, L must be on the middle shelf and O must be on the top shelf. This means that K must be on the middle shelf, and F and M must be on the bottom shelf. Since G cannot be on the same shelf as F or M, and I is already on the middle shelf, the only option left is for G and H to be on the top shelf together.

Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, Souza must be assigned parking space #3, Togowa must be assigned parking space #2, and Vaughn must be assigned parking space #1. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces:
    - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
    
A: If Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Xu must be assigned parking space #2 or higher, which means that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, which contradicts the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, this choice is not correct.
B: If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, which means that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, which contradicts the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, this choice is not correct.
C: If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, which means that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, which contradicts the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, this choice is not correct.
D: If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 or higher, which means that Xu must be assigned parking space #6, Souza must be assigned parking space #4 or lower, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #3 or lower. This satisfies all the rules, and the assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined. Therefore, this is the correct answer.
E: If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Souza must be assigned parking space #4 or lower, which means that Xu cannot be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, which contradicts the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, this choice is not correct.

Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, Souza must be assigned parking space #3, Togowa must be assigned parking space #2, and Vaughn must be assigned parking space #1. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.

  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #4. This means that Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Young must be assigned parking space #6 and Togowa must be assigned parking space #4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu must be assigned parking space #3 and Souza must be assigned parking space #2. Finally, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #1. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Choices:
  A: F or else K
  B: F or else M
  C: K or else M
  D: M or else Q
  E: P or else Q
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. If F is not selected, then the panel must include K or M. If F is selected, then the panel must include either K or M, but not both. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. If K is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. This means that F cannot be the only botanist selected. If F is not selected, then the panel must include K or M. If F is selected, then the panel must include either K or M, but not both. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. If K is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Therefore, the answer is either A or B.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then K must be selected to satisfy the condition that at least one botanist is selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, so K cannot be selected. M must be selected to satisfy the condition that at least one chemist is selected. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected to satisfy the condition that if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then K must be selected to satisfy the condition that at least one botanist is selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which means that K cannot be selected. Therefore, M must be selected to satisfy the condition that at least one chemist is selected.
  So, the answer is either F or M.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. If F is not selected, then the panel must include K or M. If F is selected, then the panel must include either K or M, but not both.
  
  A: F or else K is not necessarily true.
  B: F or else M is not necessarily true.
  C: K or else M is true, but not necessarily the only possibility.
  D: M or else Q is not necessarily true.
  E: P or else Q is not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then either K or M must be selected to fulfill the requirement of having at least one botanist.
  If F is selected, then either K or M cannot be selected due to the condition that F and K cannot both be selected and the condition that K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then either K or M must be selected to fulfill the requirement of having at least one botanist.
  If F is selected, then either K or M cannot be selected due to the condition that F and K cannot both be selected and the condition that K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  
  From the given choices, the only option that guarantees the inclusion of at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist is C: K or else M.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then K must be selected to satisfy the condition that the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If F is selected, then either K or M can be selected to satisfy the condition that the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or C.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we know that the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. We also know that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, if G and H are selected, then F cannot be selected, because if F were selected, then there would be two botanists and no zoologists. This means that either K or M must be selected in order to have at least one chemist on the panel. However, we also know that K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected, which means that Q cannot be selected. Therefore, the only possible answer is:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then the panel must include K or M.
  If F is selected, then the panel must include either K or M, but not both.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then the panel must include K or M. 
  If F is selected, then the panel must include either K or M, but not both. 
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. 
  
  Therefore, the answer must be either A or B. 
  If F is selected, then the panel must include either K or M, but not both. So, if G and H are selected, then the panel must include F, K, and either L or M. 
  If F is not selected, then the panel must include K or M. So, if G and H are selected, then the panel must include either F, K, and L or F, M, and L.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then K must be selected to fulfill the requirement of having at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If F is selected, then either K or M can be selected to fulfill the requirement of having at least one chemist and one zoologist.
  However, K and M cannot both be selected, so if F is selected, then M cannot be selected.

  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, neither Parra nor Udall can work in Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3.

  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Analysis:
  - If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we know that:
    - The first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
    - The third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  - We need to find the statement that could be false based on this information.

Solution:
  - If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, and the third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, then it is possible that:
    - At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
    - At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
    - Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
    - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
  - However, it is not possible that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on Monday, then another kind of cookie's third batch cannot be made on Monday.
  - Therefore, the answer is (C) Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?
Choices:
  A: Quinn
  B: Ruiz
  C: Verma
  D: Wells
  E: Xue
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint that "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" is not applicable.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint that "If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be" is not applicable.
  This means that Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  Since Taylor is not a project member, the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz.
  Therefore, one of Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
  Since exactly three workers will be selected, and one of them must be the project leader, 
  the remaining two workers must be project members.
  Therefore, the answer is not uniquely determined.
  The possible answers are Verma, Wells, and Xue.
Action: Answer("C or D or E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, the constraint that Taylor must be a project member if Smith is a project member is not applicable. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, the constraint that neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member if Wells is a project member is applicable. 
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Wells must not be a project member. 
  Since exactly three workers will be selected to be project members, and Wells is not a project member, then Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member and the project leader. 
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then the only worker who must be a project member is either Quinn or Ruiz.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  We need to find a worker who must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. 
  Therefore, the project members must be selected from the following workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Wells, and Xue. 
  Since we need to find a worker who must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member, we need to consider the cases where Taylor is not a project member. 
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, the project members must be selected from the following workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Wells, and Xue. 
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. 
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member and the project leader, and Wells must also be a project member. 
  Therefore, the answer is either A or B.

Action: Answer("A or B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  We need to determine which worker must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, we can eliminate Smith from the list of potential project members. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, we can eliminate Wells from the list of potential project members because we need to select three project members. 
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader. Therefore, we need to select two more project members from the remaining workers: Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Xue. 
  If Verma is a project member, then Ruiz cannot be a project member. Therefore, we can eliminate Verma from the list of potential project members. 
  If Xue is a project member, then we need to select one more project member from the remaining workers: Smith, Taylor, and Verma. However, we have already eliminated Verma from the list of potential project members. Therefore, we cannot select Xue as a project member. 
  Therefore, the only worker who must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member is Quinn. 
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint that "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" is not applicable.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint that "If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be" is not applicable.
  So, we can consider the following cases:
  
  Case 1: Quinn is a project member and the project leader.
    In this case, Ruiz cannot be a project member. 
    So, the project members are Quinn, Xue, and one of Smith, Taylor, or Wells.
    But, if Taylor is not a project member, then the project members are Quinn, Xue, and Wells.
    Therefore, Wells must be a project member in this case.
    
  Case 2: Ruiz is a project member and the project leader.
    In this case, Quinn cannot be a project member. 
    So, the project members are Ruiz, Xue, and one of Smith, Taylor, or Wells.
    But, if Taylor is not a project member, then the project members are Ruiz, Xue, and Wells.
    Therefore, Wells must be a project member in this case.
    
  Therefore, in either case, Wells must be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  We need to determine which worker must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, we can eliminate Smith from the list of potential project members. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, we can eliminate Wells from the list of potential project members. 
  This leaves us with five potential project members: Quinn, Ruiz, Taylor, Verma, and Xue. 
  Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, and we know that exactly one of the project members will be the project leader, we can eliminate Quinn and Ruiz from the list of potential project members. 
  This leaves us with two potential project members: Taylor, Verma, and Xue. 
  Since we need to determine which worker must be a project member, we can eliminate Xue from the list of potential project members because Xue is not a necessary member. 
  Therefore, the worker who must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member is Verma.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member.
  We need to determine which worker must be a project member.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. 
  Therefore, the project members must be selected from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Smith, Verma, Wells, and Xue. 
  Since the project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader, we can consider two cases:
  Case 1: Quinn or Ruiz is the leader
    If Quinn or Ruiz is the leader, then only two workers can be selected from the remaining four workers: Smith, Verma, Wells, and Xue. 
    However, if Smith is not a project member, then Taylor is also not a project member, which contradicts the given constraint. 
    Therefore, Quinn or Ruiz cannot be the leader.
  Case 2: Smith, Verma, Wells, or Xue is the leader
    If Smith, Verma, Wells, or Xue is the leader, then two workers can be selected from the remaining four workers: Quinn, Smith, Verma, Wells, and Xue. 
    However, if Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member, which contradicts the given constraint. 
    Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
    If Verma is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be a project member, which contradicts the given constraint. 
    Therefore, Verma cannot be a project member.
    If Xue is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be a project member, which contradicts the given constraint. 
    Therefore, Xue cannot be a project member.
    Therefore, Smith must be a project member.
    If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member. 
    Therefore, the third project member must be one of the following workers: Quinn, Verma, Wells, or Xue.
    However, if Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member, which contradicts the given constraint. 
    Therefore, Wells cannot be the third project member.
    If Verma is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be a project member, which contradicts the given constraint. 
    Therefore, Verma cannot be the third project member.
    If Xue is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be a project member, which contradicts the given constraint. 
    Therefore, Xue cannot be the third project member.
    Therefore, Quinn must be the third project member.
    
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" is not applicable.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. 
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Wells cannot be a project member.
  Since exactly three workers must be selected, and Taylor and Wells cannot be project members, then the remaining five workers must be considered.
  Since Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project, and we know that exactly one of the three members will be the leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
  Therefore, the answer is either A: Quinn or B: Ruiz.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, the constraint that Taylor must be a project member if Smith is a project member is not applicable. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, the third project member must be selected from Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Xue.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected as the project leader, then the other one can be a project member. Therefore, the third project member can be selected from Smith, Taylor, and Xue.
  If Verma is selected as a project member, then neither Wells nor Ruiz can be a project member. Therefore, the third project member must be selected from Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Xue.
  Therefore, the only worker who must be a project member is Smith.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" is not applicable.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. 
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Wells cannot be a project member.
  Since exactly three workers must be selected, and Taylor and Wells cannot be project members, then the project members must be selected from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Verma, and Xue.
  Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, and exactly one of the project members will be the leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
  Therefore, the answer is either A: Quinn or B: Ruiz.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Veqemite performs in slot three, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than zircon
  C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy
  D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than, wellspring
  E: Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
  A: We cannot determine the relationship between Uneasy and Xpert based on the given information.
  B: We cannot determine the relationship between Wellspring and Zircon based on the given information.
  C: We cannot determine the relationship between Xpert and Uneasy based on the given information.
  D: We cannot determine the relationship between Yardsign and Wellspring based on the given information.
  E: Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite, which is in slot three. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot one or two. Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, Xpert cannot perform in slot three. Therefore, Zircon must perform in slot four, Wellspring must perform in slot five, and Xpert must perform in slot six. Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, Uneasy must perform in slot six. Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, Yardsign must perform in slot one. Therefore, Uneasy performs in slot six, which is later than Zircon's slot. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
  A: We cannot determine the relationship between Uneasy and Xpert based on the given information.
  B: We cannot determine the relationship between Wellspring and Zircon based on the given information.
  C: We cannot determine the relationship between Xpert and Uneasy based on the given information.
  D: We cannot determine the relationship between Yardsign and Wellspring based on the given information.
  E: Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite, which is in slot three. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot one or two. Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Xpert cannot perform in slot one or two, then Xpert must perform in slot six. This means that Uneasy must perform in slot four or five, and Yardsign must perform in slot one or two. Therefore, Zircon performs in slot five and Wellspring performs in slot four.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
  A: We cannot determine the relationship between Uneasy and Xpert based on the given information.
  B: We cannot determine the relationship between Wellspring and Zircon based on the given information.
  C: We cannot determine the relationship between Xpert and Uneasy based on the given information.
  D: Yardsign must perform in slot one or two since it performs in one of the first three slots. We cannot determine the relationship between Yardsign and Wellspring based on the given information.
  E: Zircon must perform in slot four, five, or six since it performs in a later slot than Vegemite. We cannot determine the relationship between Zircon and Uneasy based on the given information.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  Since Vegemite performs in slot three, we know that the first two slots must be filled by Yardsign and Wellspring (in some order). We also know that Zircon must perform in a later slot than Vegemite, so Zircon must perform in slot four, five, or six. Since Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, Wellspring must perform in slot two. This means that Uneasy must perform in slot five or six. Xpert must perform in slot six since both Wellspring and Zircon perform in earlier slots than Xpert. 

Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, if Vegemite performs in slot three, it must be true that Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  A: We cannot determine the relationship between Uneasy and Xpert based on the given information.
  B: We cannot determine the relationship between Wellspring and Zircon based on the given information.
  C: Xpert performs in slot six, which is the only slot left for Xpert to perform in.
  D: Yardsign cannot perform in slot one or two because Vegemite and Wellspring/Zircon must perform before them. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot three, which is not an earlier slot than Wellspring.
  E: Zircon must perform in slot two, which is an earlier slot than Uneasy.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  Since Vegemite performs in slot three, we know that the first two slots must be filled by Yardsign and Wellspring (in some order). We also know that Zircon must perform in a later slot than Vegemite, so Zircon must perform in slot four, five, or six. Since Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, Wellspring must perform in slot two. This leaves Uneasy and Xpert to fill the last two slots, which must be slots four and five. Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, Uneasy must perform in slot six. This means that Xpert must perform in slot four. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
  A: We cannot determine the relationship between Uneasy and Xpert based on the given information.
  B: We cannot determine the relationship between Wellspring and Zircon based on the given information.
  C: We cannot determine the relationship between Xpert and Uneasy based on the given information.
  D: We cannot determine the relationship between Yardsign and Wellspring based on the given information.
  E: Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite, which is in slot three. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot one or two. Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Xpert cannot perform in slot one or two, then Xpert must perform in slot six. This means that Uneasy must perform in slot four or five, and Yardsign must perform in slot one or two. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot four or five, which means that Zircon must perform in slot six. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  Since Vegemite performs in slot three, we know that Yardsign cannot perform in slot one or two. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot three. This means that Uneasy cannot perform in slot three, so it must perform in slot five or six. Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Xpert cannot perform in slot one, two, or three, Xpert must perform in slot four. This means that Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and two, but we don't know which one performs in which slot. Finally, since Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, Zircon must perform in slot five or six, and Wellspring must perform in the other slot.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
  A: We cannot determine the relationship between Uneasy and Xpert based on the given information.
  B: We cannot determine the relationship between Wellspring and Zircon based on the given information.
  C: We cannot determine the relationship between Xpert and Uneasy based on the given information.
  D: We cannot determine the relationship between Yardsign and Wellspring based on the given information.
  E: Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite, which is in slot three. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot one or two. Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Xpert cannot perform in slot one or two, then Xpert must perform in slot six. Therefore, Zircon must perform in slot four and Wellspring must perform in slot five. Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and slots four, five, and six are already taken, Uneasy must perform in slot three. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, and slot one is already taken, so Yardsign must perform in slot two.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  Since Vegemite performs in slot three, we know that the first two slots must be filled by Yardsign and Wellspring (in some order). We also know that Zircon must perform in a later slot than Vegemite, so Zircon must perform in slot four, five, or six. Since Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, Wellspring must perform in slot two. This means that Uneasy must perform in slot five or six. Xpert must perform in slot six since both Wellspring and Zircon perform in earlier slots than Xpert.

Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:

We know that Peters was recruited fourth, and Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, the timeline must look like this:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Peters
5. Villas
6. White
7. Rovero

We also know that Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, and White was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, the timeline must look like this:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Peters
5. Villas
6. White
7. Rovero
8. Tao

Now we can answer the question:

  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment must be: Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton, Tao.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited first, Peters was recruited second, Villas was recruited third, White was recruited fourth, Rovero was recruited fifth, Stanton was recruited sixth, and Tao was recruited seventh.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The only option that could be true is that Tao was recruited sixth.
Response 2:

We know that Peters was recruited fourth, and Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, the timeline looks like this:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Peters
5. Villas
6. White
7. Rovero/Tao

We also know that Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, and White was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, the timeline looks like this:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Peters
5. Villas
6. White
7. Rovero
8. Tao

Now we can answer the question:
Action: Answer("D")  
Choice D: Tao was recruited sixth. This is possible because Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, and White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
Response 3:

  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Using the given information, we can create a timeline of the order in which the accomplices were recruited:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Peters
5. 
6. 
7. 

We know that Villas was recruited immediately before White, so we can add them to the timeline:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Peters
5. Villas
6. White
7. 

We also know that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so we can add them to the timeline:
1. 
2. 
3. Stanton
4. Peters
5. Villas
6. White
7. Tao

We know that Rovero was recruited after White, so we can add them to the timeline:
1. 
2. 
3. Stanton
4. Peters
5. Villas
6. White
7. Tao
8. Rovero

Finally, we know that White was recruited earlier than Rovero, and since White was recruited sixth, Rovero must have been recruited seventh. This means that Tao was recruited fifth.

A: Quinn was recruited first. - We don't know when Quinn was recruited, so this could be true.
B: Rovero was recruited third. - We know that Rovero was recruited seventh, so this is not true.
C: Stanton was recruited second. - We know that Stanton was not recruited second, so this is not true.
D: Tao was recruited sixth. - We know that Tao was recruited fifth, so this is not true.
E: Villas was recruited sixth. - We know that Villas was recruited fifth, so this is not true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - Since there are at least two books on each shelf, and I is on the middle shelf, there must be at least two books on the top and bottom shelves.
  - Since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf.
  - Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the bottom shelf.
  - Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is on the bottom shelf.
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If F and M are on the bottom shelf, then there are at least three books on the bottom shelf, which satisfies the condition that there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. H can also be on the bottom shelf since it is not restricted by any of the conditions. Therefore, a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf could be F, H, M. Thus, the answer is B.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  - From the given options, we can eliminate options A, C, and E because they do not have more than two books on the bottom shelf.
  - We can eliminate option D because it has four books on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that "more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf."
  
Action: Answer("B")  
The only option that satisfies all the given conditions is option B: F, H, M.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we can eliminate choices A and C.
  - Since I is placed on the middle shelf, we can eliminate choices B and D.
  - Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, we know that K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is also on the bottom shelf. Therefore, we can eliminate choice E.
  - This leaves us with only one choice: F, G, M, O. This is because F and M are on the same shelf, and K and L are not on the bottom shelf, leaving only G, H, and O to be placed on the bottom shelf. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Using the given conditions, we can deduce that I must be on the middle shelf, and F and M must be on the same shelf. Also, since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we know that at least 3 books must be on the bottom shelf. 

Option A is not possible because it only has two books, and we know that at least three books must be on the bottom shelf.

Option B is not possible because H is on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that F and M must be on the same shelf.

Option C is not possible because K is not on the bottom shelf.

Option D is possible because it has at least three books on the bottom shelf (F, G, and O are on the bottom shelf), and F and M are on the same shelf.

Option E is not possible because L is not on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - Since there are at least two books on each shelf, and I is on the middle shelf, there must be at least two books on the top shelf and at least three books on the bottom shelf.
  - Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, they must both be on the top shelf or both be on the bottom shelf.
  - Therefore, the bottom shelf must contain at least three books, and the only answer choice that satisfies this condition is (B) F, H, M.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  - From the given options, we can eliminate options A, C, and E because they do not have more than two books on the bottom shelf.
  - We can eliminate option D because it has four books on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that "more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf."
  
Action: Answer("B")  
The only option that satisfies all the given conditions is option B, which has F, H, and M on the bottom shelf.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.

  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, they must be together on one of the shelves.
  - I is on the middle shelf, so the top shelf must have at least 2 books and the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top or middle shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top or middle shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books, and the possible combinations are: F, G, H, M, O or F, H, M.

  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season. Choice D states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This has the same effect as the original condition because it means that M and N cannot be published in different seasons. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
Option D has the same effect as the original condition because it creates a relationship between M and N, just like the original condition. If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This means that M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other, and K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, option D has the same effect as the original condition.

  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season. 
  Choice A is not equivalent because it does not involve M and N.
  Choice B is not equivalent because it involves N and P, not M and N.
  Choice C is not equivalent because it involves M and P, not M and N.
  Choice E is not equivalent because it involves O and N, not M and N.
  Therefore, the only choice that has the same effect as the original condition is choice D, which states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are six cookbooks: K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.

  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season. 
  Choice A is incorrect because it does not mention N and has no effect on the relationship between M and N.
  Choice B is incorrect because it mentions N and P, but it does not have the same effect as the original condition.
  Choice C is incorrect because it mentions M and P, but it does not have the same effect as the original condition.
  Choice D is correct because it states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This has the same effect as the original condition, which states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  Choice E is incorrect because it mentions O and N, but it does not have the same effect as the original condition.

  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  - George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday because that would mean Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George is giving a report on Tuesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
  - Therefore, the only possible day for Nina to give a report is on Tuesday.
  - George is giving a report on Tuesday, so the remaining person who has not given a report yet is Robert or Olivia.
  - However, Olivia cannot give a report on Monday because she cannot give an afternoon report.
  - Therefore, Robert must give a report on Monday and Olivia must give a report on Wednesday.
  - Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.

  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday, which is not possible because there are no more available spots for Monday.
  - Therefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday.
  - George is giving a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  - Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so he must give a report in the morning.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be selected. 
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. 
  Therefore, the only possible members are Wells, Smith, and one of Quinn or Ruiz as the leader. 
  This satisfies all the constraints and completely determines the selection for the project.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then there are only five workers left to choose from, and none of the constraints would prevent any of them from being selected. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then there are only four workers left to choose from, and none of the constraints would prevent any of them from being selected. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then there are only five workers left to choose from, and none of the constraints would prevent any of them from being selected. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then there are only five workers left to choose from, and none of the constraints would prevent any of them from being selected. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be selected, and therefore Taylor must also be selected. This leaves only Quinn, Smith, and Xue as the remaining workers, and Quinn must be the project leader. Therefore, the selection is completely determined.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then there are only five workers left to choose from, and none of the constraints would prevent any combination of three workers from being selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then either Smith or Wells must be the project leader, but neither of them can be a project member with the other, so it is not possible to determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then there are only five workers left to choose from, and none of the constraints would prevent any combination of three workers from being selected.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader, but neither of them can be a project member with the other, so it is not possible to determine the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader, and the only other worker who can be a project member with them is Smith, so the third member must be Taylor. Therefore, the selection is completely determined.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be selected. This is because if Wells is not selected, then both Ruiz and Verma cannot be selected. But if Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected, which satisfies the constraint. Since Wells is selected, we know that neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. This means that Quinn or Ruiz must be the leader, and since Ruiz cannot be a member without being the leader, Quinn must be a member. Finally, since there are only three members, Taylor must be the third member. Therefore, the selection is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then there is no project leader, so this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then there is no project leader, so this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then there are only five workers left, and it is possible to have a project leader and two members from the remaining workers, so this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then there are only five workers left, and it is possible to have a project leader and two members from the remaining workers, so this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be a project member, and therefore Smith and Taylor must also be project members. This leaves only Quinn and Xue, and since Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader, Quinn must be the project leader and Xue must be the remaining project member. Therefore, this option completely determines the selection.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members, one of whom will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they must both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. 
  A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there are fewer sales representatives working in Zone 2 than in Zone 3.
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  D: Stuckey can work in Zone 2 because Mahr and Stuckey can both work in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that sales zone, since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. This means that Tiao cannot work in that sales zone, since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 1, and Parra must work in Zone 3. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, Quinn must also work in Zone 3. This leaves Kim to work in Zone 2, which satisfies the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that same sales zone. 
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot be in the same sales zone as Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall.
  Therefore, Kim, Tiao, and either Parra or Udall must be in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey.
  If Parra is in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey, then Tiao and Udall must be in Zone 3, which means Kim must be in Zone 2. This satisfies the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra cannot be in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey.
  If Udall is in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey, then Tiao must be in Zone 1 and Parra must be in Zone 3. This satisfies the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:

  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they are both in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. 
  If they are both in Zone 2, then Tiao cannot be in Zone 2, so Tiao must be in Zone 1, and Parra must be in Zone 3. 
  If they are both in Zone 3, then there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, so Parra cannot be in Zone 3, and Tiao must be in Zone 1.
  
  A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 if Tiao is in Zone 1.
  B: Mahr can work in Zone 1 if Stuckey is also in Zone 1.
  C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3 if Tiao is in Zone 1.

  A: Kim works in Zone 2. We don't know where Kim works, so we cannot determine if this is true or false.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1. This is not possible because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. This is possible because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. This is possible because if Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that same sales zone.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If X is mentioned in chapter 1, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so it must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 4 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  That leaves R to be mentioned in chapter 7.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then:
- U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
- W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, or 4.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 3 and 5 (in some order).
- R must be mentioned in chapter 7.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. This is not possible because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6, which means that R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. This is possible because R can be mentioned in any chapter except chapter 1, and it must be mentioned in one of the last two chapters.
C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. This is not possible because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and Z must be mentioned in either chapter 3 or 5.
D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. This is possible because W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, and it must be mentioned in one of the last two chapters. If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and R must be mentioned in chapter 7.
E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3. This is not possible because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and S must be mentioned in either chapter 3 or 5.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - Since W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  - Since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  - Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, S and Z must be mentioned in chapter 3 and chapter 5, in some order.
  - Since each clue is mentioned exactly once, R must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2, and T must be mentioned in chapter 3. Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, S and Z must be mentioned in chapter 3 and chapter 5, in some order. Since W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6. Since each clue is mentioned exactly once, R must be mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, R could be mentioned in chapter 7, which is answer choice B.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The novel consists of seven chapters, and each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then:
- U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
- W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so it must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, or 4.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither can be mentioned in chapter 2.
- R and S cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so R cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. (Possible)
B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. (Impossible, since R must be mentioned before S)
C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. (Impossible, since S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2)
D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. (Possible)
E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3. (Impossible, since Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2)

Action: Answer("A")

  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and S must be mentioned in chapter 4, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4 and S must be mentioned in chapter 3, which satisfies all the constraints.
  Therefore, if X is mentioned in chapter 1, then S must be mentioned in chapter 3.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each chapter from 1 to 7 must contain exactly one clue.

  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and S must be mentioned in chapter 4, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4 and S must be mentioned in chapter 3, which satisfies all the constraints.
  Therefore, if X is mentioned in chapter 1, then S must be mentioned in chapter 3.

Action: Answer("C")

  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so it must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.
  
  A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4, which violates the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then S must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  C: If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 3, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  D: If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3, which satisfies all the constraints.

- If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
- R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. This is possible, as T could be mentioned in chapter 2, U in chapter 4, S in chapter 5, W in chapter 6, Z in chapter 7, and R in chapter 3.
B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. This is not possible, as R cannot be mentioned in chapter 7 if X is mentioned in chapter 1.

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue. According to the given conditions, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Lifestyle section must also have one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue. Finally, the Metro section must have at least one photograph by a photographer who also has a photograph in the Lifestyle section. Since Fuentes and Hue each have one photograph in the Lifestyle section, it is possible that both photographs in the Metro section are by Hue.

  - Since the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th, since the sundial must be auctioned before it. This means that the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 6th, since the harmonica must be auctioned before it. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.

  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th, since the sundial must be auctioned before it. This leaves June 5th or June 6th as possible dates for the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 6th, since the harmonica must be auctioned before it. This leaves June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th as possible dates for the table.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: Based on the analysis, the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th. The sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, which means the table must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th. The mirror must be auctioned before the lamp, which means it cannot be auctioned on June 6th. Therefore, the only possible date for the mirror is June 5th. This leaves June 2nd and June 4th as possible dates for the vase. Since the sundial must be auctioned before the vase, the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. This means that the lamp, the mirror, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, and June 5th, but we cannot determine the exact order.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. This means that the lamp, the mirror, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 4th, and June 5th, but we cannot determine the exact order.
  
Action: Answer("D") - The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Response 7:

  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - June 1st: The sundial cannot be auctioned on this day.
  - June 2nd: The harmonica cannot be auctioned on this day because the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. The table cannot be auctioned on this day because the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. The vase cannot be auctioned on this day because the table is auctioned before the vase. Therefore, the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later. The lamp cannot be auctioned on this day if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp and the mirror is auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st. This means that the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
  - June 3rd: The table must be auctioned on this day or earlier. The harmonica is already auctioned, so the table must be auctioned on this day. This means that the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later and the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th or later.
  - June 4th: The vase must be auctioned on this day or later.
  - June 5th: The lamp must be auctioned on this day or later.
  - June 6th: Only the remaining antique, which is the sundial, can be auctioned on this day.
  
Action: Answer("B") - The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica must be auctioned after the lamp if the mirror is auctioned after the harmonica.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so the harmonica, lamp, and mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, and June 3rd, but not necessarily in that order.
  - The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, so it must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  - The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase, so it must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  - The vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, so it must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - The harmonica and the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, so they must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  - The mirror cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, so it must be auctioned on June 3rd.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp for the mirror to be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial must be auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase.
  - The table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, because if it were, the mirror would have to be auctioned on the same day or earlier, which is not possible.
  - The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd or later.
  - The table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 6th, because if it were, both the harmonica and the vase would have to be auctioned on earlier dates, which is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. This is possible because the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and it cannot be auctioned on June 4th or later because the table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the only possible date for the lamp is June 3rd.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays

Analysis:
  We need to find a valid assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies, so Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the same ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, so Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies, so at most one of them can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.

Solution:
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the same ceremony, so we can assign them to the Silva University ceremony.
  Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, so we cannot assign Lai to the Thorne University ceremony.

  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, so Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies, so at most one of them can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.

Solution:
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the same ceremony, so we can assign them to the Silva University ceremony.
  Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, so we cannot assign him.
  Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so we cannot assign him.
  Lai and Mays cannot both be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, so we cannot assign them.
  Therefore, the only valid assignment is Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck to the Silva University ceremony.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Tao was recruited second, Peters must have been recruited third.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited fifth and White sixth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited first or second.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must have been recruited either third or sixth.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
  If Tao was recruited second, and Peters was recruited fourth, then Quinn must have been recruited first or third. If Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero would have to be recruited second, which is not possible since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, Quinn must have been recruited third, and Rovero fourth. Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, and Peters was recruited fourth, then Villas must have been recruited fifth and White sixth. Since Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, and Peters was recruited fourth, then Stanton must have been recruited sixth. Therefore, Stanton could be recruited sixth.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be: 
  1. X
  2. Tao
  3. X
  4. X
  5. X
  6. X
  7. X
  
The following statements are true based on the given information:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so X cannot be Peters.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so X cannot be Quinn.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so X cannot be Villas or White.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so X cannot be Stanton or the person immediately before or after Tao.
  
Therefore, the only option that could be true is:
Action: Answer("B") Rovero was recruited fifth.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be: 
  1. X
  2. Tao
  3. X
  4. X
  5. X
  6. X
  7. X
  
The following options are possible based on the given information:
  A: Quinn was recruited third. (Possible, as Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero)
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth. (Not possible, as Peters was recruited fourth)
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth. (Not possible, as Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao)
  D: Villas was recruited sixth. (Not possible, as Villas was recruited immediately before White)
  E: White was recruited third. (Not possible, as Peters was recruited fourth)
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.

  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be: 
  1. Unknown
  2. Tao
  3. Unknown
  4. Unknown
  5. Unknown
  6. Unknown
  7. Unknown
  
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment would be:
  1. Unknown
  2. Tao
  3. Unknown
  4. Peters
  5. Unknown
  6. Unknown
  7. Unknown
  
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero, so Quinn could not have been recruited third. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas could not have been recruited sixth. Therefore, option D is not possible.
  
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment would be:
  1. Unknown
  2. Tao
  3. Unknown
  4. Peters
  5. Rovero
  6. Unknown
  7. Unknown
  
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton could not have been recruited sixth. Therefore, option C is not possible.
  
  If White was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be:
  1. Unknown
  2. Tao
  3. White
  4. Peters
  5. Rovero
  6. Villas
  7. Stanton
  
  This order satisfies all the given conditions, so option E is possible.

  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited fifth and White sixth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited first or second.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must have been recruited either first, third, or seventh.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
  - If Tao was recruited second, and Peters was recruited fourth, and Villas was recruited fifth, and White was recruited sixth, then the only option that is possible is that Villas was recruited sixth. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first, and there are five remaining accomplices to be recruited. 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited either second or third. 
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Quinn must have been recruited second. 
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited fifth and White sixth. 
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton must have been recruited seventh. 
  This leaves Rovero to be recruited sixth.
  
Action: Answer("B") Rovero was recruited fifth.
Response 6:

  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited either first or second.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must have been recruited either third or sixth.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
  - If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be: Quinn, Tao, Stanton, Peters, Villas, Rovero, White. This satisfies all the given conditions.
Response 8:

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days.
  
  If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be shorter than 1 day, which is not possible because the shortest website target is 1 day. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target must be 3 days. This means that Image's voicemail target must be 2 days, and Solide's website target must be 1 day.
  
  A: We cannot determine Image's voicemail target based on the given information.
  B: We cannot determine Image's website target based on the given information.
  C: It is possible that Image's website target is 1 day, but we cannot determine it for sure based on the given information.
  D: We know that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, but we cannot determine the exact value of Solide's website target based on the given information.
  E: We know that Solide's website target must be 1 day, based on the given information.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has two targets: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  - Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  - Image has two targets: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - There are three possible service targets: 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days.
  - Each client has two targets: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("D")
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Solide's website target must be 1 day, and Truvest's website target must be 2 days. This is because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target cannot be shorter than 2 days (since Truvest's voicemail target is longer than its website target). Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day, and Truvest's website target must be 2 days. This means that Image's voicemail target must be 3 days (since it must be longer than Truvest's voicemail target), and Image's website target must be 2 days (since it cannot be longer than its voicemail target). Therefore, Solide's website target is 2 days, which is option D.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has two targets, one for website and one for voicemail.
  - Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  - Image has two targets, one for website and one for voicemail.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - There are three possible targets: 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days.
  - The targets are different for each client and for each type of request (website or voicemail).
  - We are asked to determine which statement must be true given that Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  
Analysis:
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days.
  - Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must be 1 day.
  - Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Solide's voicemail target is already 1 day, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day as well.
  - Therefore, Image's website target must be 2 days, since it cannot be longer than its voicemail target.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has two targets: one for website and one for voicemail.
  - Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  - Two targets are set for each client.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, Truvest's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days.
  - If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be shorter than 1 day, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days.
  - Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must be 1 day.
  - Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's voicemail target, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.
  - Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, then Image's website target must also be 1 day.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has two targets, one for website and one for voicemail.
  - Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.

  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - There are three possible targets: 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days.
  - Each client has two targets, one for website and one for voicemail.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's voicemail target must be at least 2 days. This is because the shortest possible target is 1 day, and Truvest's website target is already shorter than its voicemail target. Therefore, Truvest's voicemail target cannot be 1 day. 

  If Truvest's voicemail target is at least 2 days, then Image's voicemail target must also be 2 days, since it must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. 

  If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then its website target cannot be 2 days, since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Image's website target must be 1 day. 

  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be 1 day as well. If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target can be either 1 day or 2 days, but we cannot determine which one for sure.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The articles can be ordered as follows: G, H, J, Q, R, S, Y.
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be one of the following: G, H, J or H, J, G.
  If G is first, then J must be second and H must be third.
  If H is first, then J must be second and G must be third.
  If J is first, then G must be second and H must be third.

Analysis:
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be one of the following: G, H, J or H, J, G.
  If G is first, then J must be second and H must be third. But this violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
  If H is first, then J must be second and G must be third. But this violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
  If J is first, then G must be second and H must be third. This satisfies all the conditions.
  If S is earlier than Q, then Q must be third. This is not necessarily true.
  S must be earlier than Y. This is true.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. This is true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The articles are divided into three groups: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If Y is fourth, then S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third.
  If S is second, then Q must be first or third.
  If S is third, then Q must be first or second.
  
Analysis:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be first, second, or third. 
  If S is first, then Q must be third. But this violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, S cannot be first.
  If S is second, then Q must be first or third. But if Q is first, then R must be fourth, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. Therefore, S cannot be second and Q cannot be first.
  If S is third, then Q must be first or second. If Q is first, then R must be fourth, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. Therefore, S must be third and Q must be second. This also satisfies the condition that S must be earlier than Y.
  If S is third and Q is second, then the order of the articles must be: G, J, S, Q, R, H, Y.
  Therefore, J is second.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?
Choices:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
  C: the western, the horror film
  D: the western, the mystery
  E: the western, the sci-fi film
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that the western movie is shown before the horror movie, and that screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M. Therefore, the western movie must be shown at 7 P.M. on either screen 1 or screen 2. 
  We also know that the romance movie is not shown on screen 2, and that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1, since the mystery would have to be shown on the same screen, which is not allowed. 
  Thus, the only possible movies that can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. are the western and the sci-fi film. 
  Therefore, the only option that CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening is B: the sci-fi film, the mystery, since the western movie must be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the mystery cannot be shown on the same screen as the horror film. 
  Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. with the mystery. 
  A: The sci-fi film and the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. because the horror film cannot be shown with the mystery.
  B: The sci-fi film and the mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. because the horror film cannot be shown with the mystery.
  C: The western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. with the horror film because the western begins before the horror film.
  D: The western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. with the mystery because the western begins before the horror film.
  E: The western cannot be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. with the sci-fi film because the romance is not shown on screen 2, and the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. Therefore, the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M.
  Answer: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that the western must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2, and it must be shown before the horror film. Therefore, the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1, because the western would have to be shown on screen 2, and the romance cannot be shown on screen 1 either. This eliminates choices A, B, and E. 
  The remaining choices are C and D. Both of these choices have the western shown on screen 1, which is possible. Therefore, neither of them can be eliminated based on the given conditions. 
  However, we can see that choice D has the mystery shown on screen 1 with the western, which is not possible because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the answer is D. 
Answer: D
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  - Since screen 1 shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M., and the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, we know that the horror film and the mystery cannot both be shown on screen 1.
  - The western must be shown before the horror film, so the western cannot be the 9 P.M. movie on screen 1.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 3.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  - If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M., then the mystery must also be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M. This means that the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1, since it must be shown on a different screen than the mystery. Therefore, choices A, C, and E are possible lists of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1.
  - If the western is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M., then the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. This means that the mystery must be shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M., since it cannot be shown on screen 1. Therefore, choice D is a possible list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1.
  - However, if the sci-fi film is shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M., then the romance must be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. This means that the western must be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M., since it cannot be shown on screen 2. Therefore, choice B is not a possible list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be shown on screen 1. 
  We also know that the romance is not shown on screen 2, so it cannot be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1.
  The western must be shown before the horror film, so it cannot be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or 2.
  A: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it cannot be shown at 8 P.M. on screen 1.
  B: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it cannot be shown at 8 P.M. on screen 1.
  C: The western must be shown before the horror film, so it cannot be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1.
  D: This is a possible list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.
  E: This is a possible list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.
  Therefore, the answer is D. Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that the western begins before the horror film, so the western must be shown at 7 P.M. on either screen 1 or screen 2. 
  We also know that the romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M. 
  Therefore, the mystery must be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. and the horror film must be shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M. 
  The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1 because the western is already scheduled to be shown there at 7 P.M. 
  Therefore, the only option that cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening is B: the sci-fi film, the mystery. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that the western must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2, and it must be shown before the horror film. Therefore, the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1, since the western is already taking one of the slots. This eliminates choices A, B, and E. 
  The remaining choices are C and D. Both of these choices have the western shown on screen 1, which is possible. Therefore, neither of them CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening. 
  Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that the western movie is shown before the horror movie, and that the horror movie is not shown on screen 2. Therefore, the horror movie must be shown on screen 1 or 3. However, the mystery movie is not shown on the same screen as the horror movie, so the horror movie cannot be shown on screen 1. Therefore, the horror movie must be shown on screen 3. Since the sci-fi movie is not shown on screen 3, it must be shown on screen 1. Therefore, the western movie must be shown on screen 2. This means that the mystery movie must be shown on screen 1. 
  A: The sci-fi film and the horror film are shown on screen 1 and screen 3, respectively. This is possible. 
  B: The sci-fi film and the mystery are shown on screen 1 and screen 2, respectively. This is possible. 
  C: The western and the horror film are shown on screen 2 and screen 3, respectively. This is possible. 
  D: The western and the mystery are shown on screen 2 and screen 1, respectively. This is possible. 
  E: The western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2 and screen 1, respectively. This is possible. 
  All of the options are possible, so the answer is None of the Above.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.

Analysis:
  - Since screen 1 shows two movies, and the romance is not shown on screen 2, the romance must be shown on screen 1.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so neither of them can be shown on screen 1 with the romance.
  - The western begins before the horror film, so it cannot be shown second on screen 1.
  - Therefore, the only possible order for screen 1 is: romance, sci-fi or western, horror or mystery.
  - Choice A is possible: sci-fi, horror on screen 1.
  - Choice B is possible: sci-fi, mystery on screen 1.
  - Choice C is possible: western, horror on screen 1.
  - Choice D is possible: western, mystery on screen 1.
  - Choice E is not possible because the western cannot be shown after the horror film.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that the western begins before the horror film, so the western must be shown at 7 P.M. on either screen 1 or screen 2. 
  We also know that the romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M.
  Therefore, the mystery must be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. and the horror film must be shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M.
  The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1 because the western and the romance are already scheduled to be shown on that screen.
  Therefore, the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M.
  This means that the accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first, is either the western, the mystery or the mystery, the western.
  None of the choices in the question matches this list, so the answer is: Answer("None of the above")

  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans would be featured on days 2, 4, and 6, and Rottweilers would be featured on days 3 and 5. This is possible since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, D could be true.
E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers would be featured on days 2, 4, and 6, and Himalayans would be featured on days 3 and 5. This is not possible since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days. Therefore, E is not true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) must have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Analysis:
  - If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that there cannot be any photographs by Gagnon in the Lifestyle section. 
  - We also know that there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. This means that either Fuentes or Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section.
  - We know that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there must be one photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section and one photograph by Hue in the Lifestyle section.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Metro section to satisfy the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, Gagnon cannot have all of his photographs in the Lifestyle and Sports sections. This means that Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since each photographer can have at most three photographs, and we already know that Fuentes and Hue each have one photograph, then Gagnon can have at most one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. Answer choice (C) is the only one that satisfies this condition.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Metro section to satisfy the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, Gagnon cannot have all of his photographs in the Lifestyle and Sports sections. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, we know that Gagnon must have both of his photographs in the Metro and Lifestyle sections. Therefore, both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes, so option A is not possible. Similarly, both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon, so option B is not possible. However, it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, so option C is possible. It is also possible that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, so option D is possible. Finally, it is possible that one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue, so option E is also possible.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is because there are only three photographers, and if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Gagnon. Therefore, Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Metro section, and since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then it means that there are no photographs by Gagnon in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. This means that either Fuentes or Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section. Since we know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. Therefore, the answer is (C).
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that Gagnon's photographs must be in the Metro and Sports sections. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, both photographs in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and Hue. Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which means that one photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue. This leaves the other photograph in the Sports section to be taken by Gagnon. Since Gagnon's photographs must be in the Metro and Sports sections, both photographs in the Metro section must be by Gagnon. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. Thus, the answer is C.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) will have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is because there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and if Fuentes has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section to satisfy this condition. Therefore, it is possible that one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. It is not possible for both photographs in the Metro section to be by Fuentes (because Fuentes already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section) or by Gagnon (because none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section). It is also not possible for both photographs in the Sports section to be by Hue (because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section). Finally, it is not possible to determine whether or not either photograph in the Sports section is by Hue based on the information given.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) will have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that there will be no Gagnon's photograph in the Lifestyle section. Since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, we know that either Fuentes or Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, we can conclude that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, which is possible. Therefore, the answer is (C).
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) will have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that there are no Gagnon photographs in the Lifestyle section. Since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, we know that either Fuentes or Hue must also have a photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, we can conclude that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue (choice C). It is possible that both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes (choice A) or both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon (choice B), but we cannot guarantee it based on the given information. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue (choice D) or that neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue (choice E).
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Metro section to satisfy the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, Gagnon cannot have all of his/her photographs in the Sports section. Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and we know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes. Therefore, the other photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue. This means that neither of them can have more than two photographs in total, and Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at least three sales representatives in Zone 1.
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, at most one of them works in Zone 3.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, at most one of them works in Zone 3.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone. Therefore, they both work in Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Therefore, they both work in Zone 1, Zone 2, or Zone 3.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, at most two sales representatives work in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, there are at least four sales representatives in Zone 1.
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, so Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Udall must work in Zone 3. This means that there are two sales representatives in Zone 3 (Udall and either Mahr or Kim), which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 1, and Tiao must work in Zone 1.
  - Tiao works in Zone 1, so Udall cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Udall must work in Zone 3, and there are two sales representatives in Zone 3 (Udall and either Mahr or Kim).
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, so Parra cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 3.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, so Stuckey works in Zone 3.
  - Kim, Mahr, and Quinn are the remaining sales representatives, and they must work in Zone 1 and Zone 2.
  - There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so there are two sales representatives in Zone 2 and one sales representative in Zone 1.
  - Therefore, Kim works in Zone 1, Mahr works in Zone 2, and Quinn works in Zone 1.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at least three sales representatives in Zone 1.
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, so at most one of them works in Zone 3.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, so at most one of them works in Zone 3.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, so they cannot both work in Zone 3.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, so they cannot both work in Zone 3.
  - Therefore, there is at most one sales representative in Zone 3.
  - This means that there are at least four sales representatives in Zone 1, and at least two sales representatives in Zone 2.
  - Kim and Mahr are the only sales representatives who have not been placed yet, and they must both be in Zone 1.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, there are at least four sales representatives in Zone 1.
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, and must work in Zone 2. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3. Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 1.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Therefore, if Udall works in Zone 1, then Stuckey must work in Zone 1 as well. This would mean that there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 1.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone. Therefore, if Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must work in Zone 3 as well. This would mean that there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  - Mahr and Kim are the only sales representatives left. Since there are at least four sales representatives in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 1, then Kim must work in Zone 1. This means that Mahr works in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two representatives in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If Kim works in Zone 2, then Mahr must work in Zone 3, and there would be at most one representative in Zone 1, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, A is not true.
  - If Mahr works in Zone 2, then Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 1 and Zone 3, respectively. This means Parra must work in Zone 2 with Kim, and Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall are in Zone 3. This satisfies all the given conditions, and there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, B could be true.
  - If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must work in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 2. This means Tiao must work in Zone 1 with Kim and Mahr. However, this violates the given condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, C is not true.
  - If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 2, and Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3. This means Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey are in Zone 1, 2, and 3, respectively. There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, but there are also more representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, D is not true.
  - If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3, and Tiao must work in Zone 1. This means Parra and Quinn are in Zone 2, and Kim and Mahr are in Zone 1 and 2, respectively. There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and there are also more representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, E is not true.

  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 3 or 4 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  
Analysis:
  - A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there are already two sales representatives assigned to Zone 2 (either Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 2).
  - B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 2 because there are already two sales representatives assigned to Zone 2 (either Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 2).
  - C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Parra must work in Zone 1.
  - D: Tiao must work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  - E: Udall must work in Zone 1 because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone and there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so Udall cannot work in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.

  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, there are at least four sales representatives in Zone 1.
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, there is at most one sales representative in Zone 1 who is not Parra or Tiao.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, there is at most one sales representative in Zone 2 who is not Tiao or Udall.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone. Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is also in Zone 1.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Therefore, if Udall is in Zone 2, then Stuckey is also in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Tiao works in Zone 1, which is consistent with the given conditions and the fact that there are at least four sales representatives in Zone 1. None of the other choices can be true based on the given conditions and the analysis.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 (but not both).
  - Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2 (but not both).
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If Kim works in Zone 2, then there would be at most one sales representative in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, A is not possible.
  - If Mahr works in Zone 2, then there would be at most one sales representative in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, B is not possible.
  - If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must work in Zone 3 as well (since they work in the same sales zone). This means there would be at most one sales representative in Zone 2, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, C is not possible.
  - If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 2 (since they cannot both work in the same zone). This means there would be at most one sales representative in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, D is not possible.
  - If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well (since they work in the same sales zone). This means there would be at most one sales representative in Zone 2, which is consistent with the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, E could be true.

Action: Answer("E")

  - Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.

  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 3 or 4 sales representatives in Zone 1, and either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If Kim works in Zone 2, then neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 2, which means Tiao and Parra would have to work in Zone 1, leaving only Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall to work in Zone 3. This would mean that there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, A is not possible.
  - If Mahr works in Zone 2, then neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 2, which means Tiao and Parra would have to work in Zone 1, leaving only Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall to work in Zone 3. This would mean that there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, B is not possible.
  - If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao would have to work in Zone 1, which means neither Parra nor Quinn can work in Zone 2. This leaves only Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall to work in Zone 2 and Zone 1, which means there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, C is not possible.
  - If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra would have to work in Zone 3, which means neither Parra nor Quinn can work in Zone 2. This leaves only Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall to work in Zone 2 and Zone 1, which means there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, D is not possible.
  - If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey would have to work in Zone 3 as well, which means neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 2. This leaves only Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, and Tiao to work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, which means there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 1, which is consistent with the given information that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, E is possible.

  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at least three sales representatives in Zone 1.

  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test H on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day.
  
Analysis:
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the first day. Therefore, Seamus must test either F, G, or H on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test H on the first day. Therefore, Yuki must test either F or G on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day. Therefore, Reynaldo must test either F, H, or J on the second day.
  - From the above analysis, we can see that Seamus must test H on the first day, and Yuki must test G on the first day. This means that Seamus will test either F or J on the second day, and Reynaldo will test either F or J on the second day. Theresa will test either G or H on the second day.
  - Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.

  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on a different shelf than I and M. We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, so this creates a contradiction. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we do not have enough information to determine the placement of the other books. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must be on a different shelf than L and F. We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, so this creates a contradiction. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on the same shelf as M and H. We also know that I is on the middle shelf, so the remaining books (G, K, and O) must be on the bottom shelf. Finally, we know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so L must be on the top shelf. Therefore, this statement is true.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that L must be on the top shelf. We also know that I is on the middle shelf, so the remaining books (F, G, K, and M) must be on the bottom shelf. However, we do not have enough information to determine the placement of H and O on the middle or bottom shelf. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If I is placed on the middle shelf, then we know that the top shelf must have at least 2 books and the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  - If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on the top or middle shelf.
  - If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top or middle shelf.
  - If F is placed on the same shelf as M, then F and M must be on the top, middle, or bottom shelf together.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, then we know that F and M must also be on the same shelf as each other. Therefore, we can deduce that F, L, and M are on the same shelf, and K, G, H, I, and O are on the other two shelves. This satisfies all of the given conditions.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If I is on the middle shelf, then the top shelf must have at least 2 books and the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  - If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf and F cannot be on the top shelf.
  - If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf and L cannot be on the top shelf.
  - If F is on the same shelf as M, then they must be on the top or middle shelf together.
  - If any two books are placed on the same shelf, then the remaining 6 books must be placed on the other two shelves, with at least 2 books on each shelf.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, then they cannot be on the top shelf because the top shelf must have at least 2 books. Therefore, L and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf together. If they are on the middle shelf, then I, K, and O must be on the bottom shelf, which means M and G must be on the top shelf. This leaves H to be placed on either the top or middle shelf, which satisfies all the conditions. If L and F are on the bottom shelf together, then I must be on the top shelf, which means K and O must be on the middle shelf, which means M and G must be on the middle or bottom shelf together. This leaves H to be placed on either the top or middle shelf, which again satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, if L and F are placed on the same shelf, then the placement of all the books is fully determined.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on a different shelf than I and M, because F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F must be on the top or middle shelf, and I and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf. However, we do not know where the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which shelf each book is on.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we do not know where the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which shelf each book is on.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must be on the same shelf as F and L, because F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F, L, and M must be on the same shelf, and the other books must be on the other two shelves. Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we know that F, L, and M must be on the bottom shelf, and the other books must be on the top and middle shelves. Therefore, if L and F are placed on the same shelf, it is fully determined which shelf each book is on.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on the same shelf as M, because F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F, M, and H must be on the same shelf, and the other books must be on the other two shelves. Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we know that F, M, and H must be on the bottom shelf, and the other books must be on the top and middle shelves. Therefore, if M and H are placed on the same shelf, it is fully determined which shelf each book is on.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we do not know where the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which shelf each book is on.

Action: Answer("D")

  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on a different shelf than I and M. We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, so this creates a contradiction. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we do not have enough information to determine the placement of the other books. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must be on a different shelf than L and F. We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, so this creates a contradiction. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on the same shelf as M and H. We also know that I is on the middle shelf, so the remaining books (G, K, and O) must be on the bottom shelf. Finally, we know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the bottom shelf with G and K, and L must be on the middle shelf. Therefore, this statement is true.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that L must be on the middle shelf and I must be on the top shelf. We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, so the remaining books (G and K) must be on the bottom shelf. However, we cannot determine whether H and O are on the top or middle shelf, so this statement cannot be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If I is on the middle shelf, then the top shelf must have at least 2 books, and the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  - If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf, and F cannot be on the top shelf.
  - If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf, and L cannot be on the top shelf.
  - If F is on the same shelf as M, then F and M must be on the same shelf, and that shelf cannot be the top shelf.
  - If any two books are placed on the same shelf, then the remaining 6 books must be placed on the other two shelves, and the conditions above must still be satisfied.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, then we know that F cannot be on the top shelf (because L cannot be on the bottom shelf), and F cannot be on the bottom shelf (because K is on a higher shelf than F). Therefore, F must be on the middle shelf, and M must also be on the middle shelf (because F is on the same shelf as M). Since I is also on the middle shelf, we know that the top shelf must have G and H, and the bottom shelf must have K and O. This satisfies all of the conditions.

  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on a different shelf than I and M, because F is on the same shelf as M. We also know that K and O must be on the bottom shelf, because they are both on a higher shelf than F and L, respectively. However, we do not know where G, H, or L are placed. Therefore, this statement does not fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we know that K must be on a higher shelf than F, and G must be on a different shelf than F. We also know that O and L must be on the bottom shelf, because they are both on a higher shelf than L and F, respectively. However, we do not know where I, H, or M are placed. Therefore, this statement does not fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must also be on that shelf, because F is on the same shelf as M. We also know that K and O must be on the bottom shelf, because they are both on a higher shelf than F and L, respectively. We also know that I must be on the middle shelf. Therefore, this statement fully determines which shelf each book is placed on.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on that shelf as well, because F is on the same shelf as M. We also know that K and O must be on the bottom shelf, because they are both on a higher shelf than F and L, respectively. However, we do not know where I, G, or L are placed. Therefore, this statement does not fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.

  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. (Not necessarily true. There is no information about which bicycle Reynaldo tests on the first day.)
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. (Not necessarily true. There is no information about which bicycle Reynaldo tests on the first day.)
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day. (Not necessarily true. Theresa could test H on the first day and another bicycle on the second day.)
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. (Not necessarily true. Theresa could test another bicycle on the first day and J on the second day.)
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day. (This must be true. Since Theresa tests G on the second day, Yuki cannot test J on the second day. Therefore, Yuki must test H on the second day, and since the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, Seamus must test G on the first day.)

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are seven articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the order of the nutrition articles is determined, but it is not clear where the finance articles and the wildlife article fit in. Therefore, this choice does not fully determine the order.
  If H is sixth, then the order of the nutrition articles is determined, but it is not clear where the finance articles and the wildlife article fit in. Therefore, this choice does not fully determine the order.
  If R is fourth, then the order of the nutrition articles is determined, and the order of the finance articles is also determined. However, it is not clear where the wildlife article fits in. Therefore, this choice does not fully determine the order.
  If R is seventh, then the order of the nutrition articles is determined, and the order of the finance articles is also determined. Additionally, the wildlife article must be edited fifth, and the order is fully determined. Therefore, this choice fully determines the order.
  If Y is fifth, then the order of the nutrition articles is determined, and the order of the finance articles is also determined. However, it is not clear where the wildlife article fits in. Therefore, this choice does not fully determine the order.

A: If H is fourth, then the order of the articles is not fully determined because we don't know the order of the first three articles.
B: If H is sixth, then the order of the articles is not fully determined because we don't know the order of the first five articles.
C: If R is fourth, then the order of the articles is not fully determined because we don't know the order of the first three articles.
D: If R is seventh, then the order of the articles is fully determined because we know that Y must be fifth, and S must be earlier than Q, which must be earlier than R. Therefore, the order of the articles is S, Q, R, G, J, H, Y.
E: If Y is fifth, then the order of the articles is not fully determined because we don't know the order of the first four articles.

  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the order of the first four articles is either GHSQ or GHQS. The next article must be either R or S, but if S is next, then Q must be third, which is not possible if H is fourth. Therefore, the order of the first four articles is GHQS, and the next article must be either R or S. If R is fifth, then the last two articles must be YJ, but J must be earlier than G, which is not possible if R is fifth. Therefore, R is seventh, and the order of the articles is GHQSYJR. The order is fully determined.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - G, H, and J cover finance.
  - Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  - Y covers wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: If H is fourth, we don't know the order of the first three articles, so we cannot determine the order of the remaining articles.
B: If H is sixth, we know that the first three articles must be Q, R, and S in some order. However, we don't know the order of the remaining articles, so we cannot determine the order of all the articles.
C: If R is fourth, we know that the first three articles must be Q, S, and either G or J. If the first three articles are Q, S, and G, then the order of the remaining articles is fully determined: R, J, H, Y. If the first three articles are Q, S, and J, then the order of the remaining articles is fully determined: R, G, H, Y. So the answer is C.
D: If R is seventh, we know that the first three articles must be Q, S, and either G or J. However, we don't know the order of the remaining articles, so we cannot determine the order of all the articles.
E: If Y is fifth, we know that S must be first, followed by Q, then one of G or J, then either G or J, then Y. However, we don't know the order of H and R, so we cannot determine the order of all the articles.

Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are seven articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, in that order. The fourth article must be either G or J, but we don't know which one. The fifth article must be the remaining article between G and J, and the sixth and seventh articles must be H and Y, in that order. However, we don't know whether the fifth article is G or J, so the order is not fully determined. Therefore, A is not the correct answer.
  If H is sixth, then the first five articles must be Q, R, S, G, and J, in that order. The sixth article must be Y, and the seventh article must be H. This order satisfies all the conditions, so the answer is fully determined. Therefore, B is the correct answer.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y, in that order. The fourth article must be one of the finance articles, but we don't know which one. The fifth article must be the remaining finance article, and the sixth and seventh articles must be G and H, in that order. However, we don't know whether the fourth article is G or J, so the order is not fully determined. Therefore, C is not the correct answer.
  If R is seventh, then the first six articles must be Q, S, Y, G, J, and H, in that order. However, we don't know which article comes first, so the order is not fully determined. Therefore, D is not the correct answer.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, R, and G, in that order. The fifth article must be Y, and the sixth and seventh articles must be J and H, in that order. However, this order violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y, so the order is not fully determined. Therefore, E is not the correct answer.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf.
  - Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there are at least 4 books on the bottom shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the same shelf as M.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is on the middle shelf.
  - If F and M are on the same shelf, then they cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  - Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf with I.
  - Since G is on the top shelf, H and L must be on the bottom shelf with at least one other book.
  - That leaves K and O to be on the remaining shelf, which is the middle shelf.
  - Therefore, the complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is I, K, O.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom
  - At least 2 books are on each shelf
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
  - I is on the middle shelf
  - K is on a higher shelf than F
  - O is on a higher shelf than L
  - F is on the same shelf as M
  - If G is on the top shelf, then there are at least 2 books on the top shelf
  - If G is on the top shelf, then there are at least 3 books on the bottom shelf
  
Analysis:
  - If G is on the top shelf, then there are at least 2 books on the top shelf. Therefore, there are at most 4 books on the bottom shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  - F is on the same shelf as M, so if F is not on the middle shelf, then M is not on the middle shelf either.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - If G is on the top shelf, then H cannot be on the top shelf because there are at least 2 books on the top shelf.
  
Solution:
  - If G is on the top shelf, then the books on the bottom shelf are {F, H, L, M, O}.
  - I is on the middle shelf, so it must be on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F, so it cannot be on the middle shelf.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L, so it cannot be on the middle shelf.
  - F is on the same shelf as M, so if F is not on the middle shelf, then M is not on the middle shelf either.
  - Therefore, the only possible list of books on the middle shelf is {I}.

  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf. Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there are at least 4 books on the bottom shelf. Therefore, there are exactly 2 books on the middle shelf. We know that I is one of the books on the middle shelf, so we need to find another book that can be placed on the middle shelf with I.

  A: H cannot be placed on the middle shelf because there are already two books on that shelf.
  B: L cannot be placed on the middle shelf because it must be placed on a higher shelf than O.
  C: H and L cannot be placed on the middle shelf because there are already two books on that shelf and L must be placed on a higher shelf than O.
  D: K cannot be placed on the middle shelf because it must be placed on a higher shelf than F.
  E: F and M cannot be placed on the middle shelf because F must be placed on a lower shelf than K.

  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are 2 books on the top shelf and at least 3 books on the bottom shelf. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf. Also, K and O are both placed on a higher shelf than L, so they cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, the only book that could be on the middle shelf with I is L.

Therefore, there are exactly 2 books on the middle shelf. We know that I is one of the books on the middle shelf, so we need to find another book that can be placed on the middle shelf with I.

  A: H cannot be on the middle shelf because there are already 2 books on the middle shelf and at least 2 books on the bottom shelf.
  B: L cannot be on the middle shelf because F and M are on the same shelf, and we know that F is not on the middle shelf.
  C: This is a possible list of books on the middle shelf. H and L are on the bottom shelf, and K and O are on the top shelf.

Therefore, there are exactly 2 books on the middle shelf. We know that I is one of the books on the middle shelf. Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the middle shelf. Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the middle shelf. Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, F cannot be on the middle shelf. Therefore, the only book that can be on the middle shelf with I is H.

  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books (since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf). Also, since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, K must be on the middle shelf with I. Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf with G. This leaves H and L to be placed on the bottom shelf with at least one more book.
  
  Therefore, a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is I, K.

The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. 
  A: The harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th because the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: The lamp cannot be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th because the table is auctioned on a later date than both the mirror and the vase. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th because the sundial is not auctioned on a later date than the mirror. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, so it is possible that the mirror is auctioned on June 3rd, the vase is auctioned on June 4th, and the table is auctioned on June 5th. Therefore, D could be true.
  E: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it is possible that the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd and the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. Therefore, E could be true.

  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the table must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th, which contradicts the given condition.
  - Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, which contradicts the given condition.
  - Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, then the table must be auctioned on June 4th, which contradicts the given condition.

Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and before the vase.
  - We know the order of the antiques auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd: the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd. Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, so it must be auctioned on June 1st.
  - We also know that the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp or the mirror, so the lamp and the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.

Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  - If the mirror is auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, then the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  - If the vase is auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.

Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.

  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. Let's consider each option:
  
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th. However, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, so this option cannot be true.
  
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  We don't have enough information to determine whether this option is true or false. It is possible that the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, and the lamp is auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  This option cannot be true because we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, and the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  This option must be true because we know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned. If the mirror is auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th, then the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. If the vase is auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  This option cannot be true because we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, and the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the lamp cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase, and the lamp cannot be auctioned on a date earlier than the mirror.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase, and the sundial cannot be auctioned on a date earlier than the mirror or the vase.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th.

Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: S is mentioned in chapter 3.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 4.
  D: U is mentioned in chapter 1.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The mystery novel consists of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  
Analysis:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or earlier.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, which is not possible because Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is not possible because U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then W must be mentioned in chapter 3, which is not possible because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, the only possible option is:
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The novel consists of seven chapters, and each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.

  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then R cannot be mentioned in chapter 7.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4. If T is mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6. Therefore, U and X must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 3 or in chapters 4 and 5. If U and X are mentioned in chapters 4 and 5, then R must be mentioned in chapter 3, and S must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is not possible. Therefore, U and X must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 3. If U and X are mentioned in chapters 2 and 3, then R must be mentioned in chapter 4, and S must be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 5, and T must be mentioned in chapter 2. This leaves chapter 1 for W and chapter 6 for R. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that X is mentioned in chapter 5.

  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  - If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 5. This would mean that U must be mentioned in chapter 4, which is not possible since X and U must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, and T must be mentioned in chapter 4. This would mean that W must be mentioned in chapter 6, which is not possible since T and W must have exactly two chapters separating them.
  - If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5. This would mean that X must be mentioned in chapter 4, and U must be mentioned in chapter 6. Finally, S must be mentioned in chapter 1, which satisfies all the constraints.
  - If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5. This would mean that X must be mentioned in chapter 4, and U must be mentioned in chapter 6. Finally, R must be mentioned in chapter 1, which satisfies all the constraints.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The project has four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Each year has exactly one student assigned to it.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany. 
  From the given conditions, we know that if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, if Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, if Mollie is not assigned to the project, then 1921 and 1922 must be assigned to other students.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1921.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922, but she cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Tiffany's, which is 1922. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1921.

  A: We don't know if Louis is assigned to the project or not.
  B: We don't know if Ryan is assigned to the project or not.
  C: We don't know if Tiffany is assigned to the project or not.
  D: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then Onyx could be assigned to 1922. If Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, and Onyx must be assigned to 1922. If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project, and Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. In this case, Onyx could be assigned to 1922.
  E: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1924. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, and Onyx must be assigned to 1922. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. In this case, Louis cannot be assigned to 1924.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - There are four years to be assigned, and each year must be assigned to one student.
  - Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project. Since there are four years to be assigned, one of the students will not be assigned to any year. This means that one of the students will not be assigned to the project. 
  - A is not possible because Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923.
  - B is not possible because if Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - C is not possible because if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project.
  - E is not possible because Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and there are only four years to be assigned. 
  Therefore, D is the only possible option.

  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  A: There is no information about Louis being assigned or not assigned to the project.
  B: There is no information about Ryan being assigned or not assigned to the project.
  C: If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan is not assigned to the project, which violates the condition "If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project." Therefore, C cannot be true.
  D: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. This leaves only Louis and Mollie to be assigned to 1921 and 1922, but Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922 because she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  E: If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, Ryan must be assigned to 1922, and Onyx must be assigned to 1921. This leaves only Mollie and Yoshio to be assigned to 1921 and 1922, and Mollie can be assigned to either year. Therefore, E could be true.

  - C cannot be true because if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project.
  - D could be true because Onyx could be assigned to 1922.
  - E cannot be true because Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1924.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - There are six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  A: There is no information about Louis being assigned or not assigned to the project.
  B: There is no information about Ryan being assigned or not assigned to the project.
  C: If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan is not assigned to the project, which violates the condition "If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project." Therefore, C cannot be true.
  D: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. This leaves only Louis and Mollie to be assigned to 1921 and 1922, but Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922 because she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  E: If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, Ryan must be assigned to 1922, and Onyx must be assigned to 1921. This leaves only Mollie and Yoshio to be assigned to 1921 and 1922, and Mollie can be assigned to either year. Therefore, E could be true.

Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - There are six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project:
  - There are five students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  - Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there is no one left to assign to 1923, which contradicts the condition that Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. Therefore, A is not true.
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then there is no one left to assign to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which contradicts the condition that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, B is not true.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then there is no one left to assign to 1923, which contradicts the condition that Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. Therefore, C is not true.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and either Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. This is possible, so D could be true.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan must be assigned to 1922. This is possible, so E could be true.
  
Action: Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - There are six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project. Let's analyze each option:
  A: If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there are only four students available for the project. This is not possible since there are four years to cover and each year must have one student assigned to it.
  B: If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project (because if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project). This means that there are only four students available for the project. This is not possible since there are four years to cover and each year must have one student assigned to it.
  C: If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project (because if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project). This means that there are only four students available for the project. This is not possible since there are four years to cover and each year must have one student assigned to it.
  D: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923 (because Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's). This means that Tiffany must be assigned to the project (because if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project). This also means that Louis cannot be assigned to the project (because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923). Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922. This leaves Yoshio to be assigned to 1924. This is a possible scenario.
  E: If Louis is assigned to 1924, then only Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. This means that Ryan must be assigned to the project (because if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project). This also means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922 (because Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's). Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1921. This leaves no student available to be assigned to 1922. This is not a possible scenario.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - There are six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  Yoshio is not assigned to the project, so there are five students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  
Analysis:
  - If Louis is assigned to the project, then he cannot be assigned to 1923, so Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. But if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This leaves only Mollie available for 1921 or 1922, which is not possible because Mollie cannot be assigned to both years. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This leaves only Mollie available for 1921 or 1922, which is possible. Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Louis must be assigned to 1924. Therefore, Ryan can be assigned to the project.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This leaves only Mollie available for 1921 or 1922, which is possible. Louis cannot be assigned to 1923, so he must be assigned to 1924. Therefore, Tiffany can be assigned to the project.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, Tiffany must be assigned to 1924, and Louis and Mollie must be assigned to 1921 and 1924 in some order. This is not possible because Louis and Mollie cannot be assigned to the same year. Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, Ryan must be assigned to 1922, and Mollie and Onyx must be assigned to 1921 and 1923 in some order. This is not possible because Mollie and Onyx cannot be assigned to the same year. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1924.
  
Conclusion:
  The only option that could be true is B: Ryan is not assigned to the project. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - There are six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  Yoshio is not assigned to the project, so there are five students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  
Analysis:
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then neither he nor Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, which violates one of the conditions. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then neither he nor Onyx can be assigned to any year, which violates one of the conditions. Therefore, Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, which violates one of the conditions. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1921 or 1922, then Mollie cannot be assigned to that year, which violates one of the conditions. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1923 or 1924, and Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, which violates one of the conditions. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1921 or 1924.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Therefore, it is possible that Louis is assigned to 1924.

  4. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  5. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring (from statement 5). Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall (from statement 3 and 4). This means that P cannot be published in the fall (from statement 2). Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed before S must be O and either F or R. 
  The eighth composition must be either L or H, which means that the other one must be performed before S. 
  Also, P must be performed before S, which means that P cannot be performed first. 
  Therefore, the only possible order for the first three compositions is O, F, R or O, R, F.
  
  A: F, H, P - P cannot be performed before S, so this is not possible.
  B: H, P. L - P cannot be performed before S, so this is not possible.
  C: O, P, R - This is possible, as O is performed first, followed by P and then R.
  D: O, P, T - T cannot be performed before F or after R, so this is not possible.
  E: P, R, T - O must be performed before S, so this is not possible.

  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the compositions must be one of the following:
  1. O _ _ S _ _ _ _
  2. _ _ O _ S _ _ _
  3. _ _ _ _ O _ S _
  4. _ _ _ _ _ _ O S
  
  A: F, H, P - F and H cannot be performed before S, so this option is not possible.
  B: H, P, L - H and L cannot be the eighth composition performed, so this option is not possible.
  C: O, P, R - This option is possible. O is performed first, P is performed second, and R is performed third.
  D: O, P, T - T cannot be performed immediately after O, so this option is not possible.
  E: P, R, T - T cannot be performed immediately after R, so this option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the compositions must satisfy the following conditions:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed before S must be O, P, and one of {F, R, T}. 
  The composition performed after S must be one of {F, R, T}.
  
  A: F, H, P - If P is performed third, then S must be performed fifth. This violates the condition that P is performed at some time before S. Incorrect.
  B: H, P. L - If S is performed fourth, then L or H must be performed eighth. This violates the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H. Incorrect.
  C: O, P, R - If S is performed fourth, then T must be performed first or second. This violates the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. Incorrect.
  D: O, P, T - If S is performed fourth, then F must be performed fifth and T must be performed sixth. This satisfies all the conditions. Correct.
  E: P, R, T - If S is performed fourth, then T must be performed seventh. This violates the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions that are performed before S are O, ?, ?, and P.
  
  A: F, H, P - If F is performed fifth, then T must be performed immediately before F or immediately after R. If T is performed immediately after R, then R must be performed before F. But, if R is performed before F, then at least two compositions must be performed after F and before R, which is not possible since only S is left. Therefore, T must be performed immediately before F, which means that R must be performed after F. Thus, the order of the compositions would be O, T, F, R, ?, ?, P, S. This is not a valid order since there are no compositions left to fill the two question marks.
  
  B: H, P, L - If S is performed fourth, then the compositions that are performed before S are O, ?, ?, and P. Since P is performed before S, it must be performed either first, second, or third. If P is performed first, then the order of the compositions would be O, ?, ?, P, S, ?, ?, ?. But, since the eighth composition performed is either L or H, and P is performed before S, the only compositions left to fill the last four question marks are F, R, and either L or H. Therefore, P cannot be performed first. If P is performed second, then the order of the compositions would be O, P, ?, S, ?, ?, L/H, ?. But, since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and P is performed before S, the only compositions left to fill the last four question marks are F, R, and either L or H. Therefore, P cannot be performed second. If P is performed third, then the order of the compositions would be O, ?, P, S, ?, ?, L/H, ?. But, since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and P is performed before S, the only compositions left to fill the last four question marks are F, R, and either L or H. Therefore, P cannot be performed third. Thus, option B is not a valid order.
  
  C: O, P, R - If S is performed fourth, then the compositions that are performed before S are O, ?, ?, and P. Since P is performed before S, it must be performed either first, second, or third. If P is performed first, then the order of the compositions would be O, ?, ?, P, S, ?, L/H, R. But, since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and P is performed before S, the only compositions left to fill the last three question marks are F and either L or H. Therefore, P cannot be performed first. If P is performed second, then the order of the compositions would be O, P, ?, S, ?, L/H, R, F. This is a valid order since T can be performed immediately before F and the eighth composition performed can be either L or H. Thus, option C is a valid order.
  
  D: O, P, T - If S is performed fourth, then the compositions that are performed before S are O, ?, ?, and P. Since P is performed before S, it must be performed either first, second, or third. If P is performed first, then the order of the compositions would be O, ?, ?, P, S, ?, L/H, T. But, since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and P is performed before S, the only compositions left to fill the last three question marks are F and either L or H. Therefore, P cannot be performed first. If P is performed second, then the order of the compositions would be O, P, ?, S, ?, L/H, T, F. This is a valid order since R can be performed after F and the eighth composition performed can be either L or H. Thus, option D is a valid order.
  
  E: P, R, T - If S is performed fourth, then the compositions that are performed before S are O, ?, ?, and P. Since P is performed before S, it must be performed either first, second, or third. If P is performed first, then the order of the compositions would be O, ?, ?, P, S, R, L/H, T. But, since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and P is performed before S, the only compositions left to fill the last two question marks are F and either L or H. Therefore, P cannot be performed first. If P is performed second, then the order of the compositions would be O, P, ?, S, R, L/H, T, F. But, since T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and P is performed before S, the only compositions left to fill the two question marks are O and either L or H. Therefore, T cannot be performed last. If P is performed third, then the order of the compositions would be O, ?, P, S, R, L/H, T, F. But, since T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and P is performed before S, the only compositions left to fill the two question marks are O and either L or H. Therefore, T cannot be performed last. Thus, option E is not a valid order.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the compositions must satisfy the following conditions:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed before S must be O and either F or R. Therefore, the composition performed third must be either F or R.
  
  A: F, H, P - If F is performed third, then T must be performed second, which violates the condition that O must be performed either first or fifth.
  B: H, P. L - If H is performed eighth, then O must be performed first, which violates the condition that O must be performed either first or fifth.
  C: O, P, R - If R is performed third, then F must be performed second, which violates the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  D: O, P, T - If T is performed second, then F must be performed third, which violates the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  E: P, R, T - If R is performed first, then O must be performed fifth, which violates the condition that O is performed either first or fifth.

  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed before S must be O and either F or R. Therefore, the compositions performed first, second, and third must be chosen from the remaining five compositions: H, L, P, R/F, and T.
  
  A: F cannot be performed third because it would violate the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  B: H cannot be performed first because it would violate the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  C: O is performed first, but R cannot be performed second because it would violate the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  D: O is performed first, and T can be performed third, but P cannot be performed second because it would violate the condition that P is performed at some time before S.
  E: T cannot be performed third because it would violate the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  
  Therefore, the answer is D: O, P, T.

  If bay 4 holds grain, then bay 5 must hold livestock, and bay 6 must hold textiles. This would mean that bay 3 holds produce, bay 2 holds fuel, and bay 1 holds machinery. However, this would violate the rule that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, grain cannot be held in bay 4.
  If bay 4 holds livestock, then bay 5 must hold textiles, and bay 6 must hold grain. This would mean that bay 3 holds produce, bay 2 holds machinery, and bay 1 holds fuel. However, this would violate the rule that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, livestock cannot be held in bay 4.
  If bay 4 holds machinery, then bay 5 must hold produce, and bay 6 must hold livestock. This would mean that bay 3 holds fuel, bay 2 holds textiles, and bay 1 holds grain. This arrangement satisfies all the given rules.
  If bay 4 holds produce, then bay 5 must hold fuel, and bay 6 must hold machinery. This would mean that bay 3 holds textiles, bay 2 holds grain, and bay 1 holds livestock. However, this would violate the rule that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. Therefore, produce cannot be held in bay 4.
  If bay 4 holds textiles, then bay 5 must hold grain, and bay 6 must hold produce. This would mean that bay 3 holds livestock, bay 2 holds fuel, and bay 1 holds machinery. However, this would violate the rule that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, textiles cannot be held in bay 4.

Analysis:
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo after the other bays have been assigned their cargos. 
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo, and Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  Bay 4 cannot hold grain because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and Bay 4 is lower than Bay 5, which holds livestock.
  Bay 4 cannot hold livestock because the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, and Bay 4 is lower than Bay 5, which holds textiles.
  Bay 4 cannot hold produce because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, and Bay 4 is lower than Bay 5, which holds fuel.
  Bay 4 cannot hold textiles because the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, and Bay 4 is not next to Bay 5, which holds produce.

  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  Bay 4 is not adjacent to the bay holding textiles, so it cannot hold textiles or produce. 
  Bay 4 is not the highest-numbered bay, so it cannot hold produce or fuel.
  Bay 4 is not the lowest-numbered bay, so it cannot hold grain or livestock.
  Therefore, the only remaining option is machinery.

  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Bay 4 cannot hold livestock because the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, and the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, which means that the bay holding textiles must be either bay 5 or bay 2. Therefore, the bay holding livestock must be either bay 6 or bay 3. If the bay holding livestock is bay 6, then the bay holding grain must be bay 5, which is impossible because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, the bay holding livestock must be bay 3, which means that the bay holding grain must be bay 4. Thus, bay 4 cannot hold livestock.

- Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of the same wall.
- Isaacs's oil must be displayed in the upper position of the same wall.
- Hidalgo's paintings cannot be displayed on the same wall as Franz's or Isaacs's paintings.
- Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of one of the remaining walls, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of the same wall.
- This means that Hidalgo's watercolor is not displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
- Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.

Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Analysis: 
  - If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so neither Franz's oil nor Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil and Franz's watercolor.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil and Franz's watercolor.
  - Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then Franz's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of that wall. Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of that wall. This means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of that wall, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on a different wall from Isaacs's watercolor. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position on a wall other than wall 4, and Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in an upper position on a wall other than wall 4. Thus, the only option that must be true is that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 7:
Knowledge:

  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then Franz's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of that wall. Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of that wall. This means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of that wall, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, which means that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position. Thus, the correct answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the four walls has one upper and one lower position, and each wall displays two paintings.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then:
  - Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of that wall.
  - Franz's oil must be displayed in the upper position of that wall.
  - Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on that wall, so it must be displayed on one of the other three walls.
  - Hidalgo must have one oil and one watercolor, and neither can be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil or watercolor.
  
Analysis:
  - A: We don't know where Greene's oil is displayed, so this is not necessarily true.
  - B: We don't know where Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed, so this is not necessarily true.
  - C: We don't know where Hidalgo's oil is displayed, so this is not necessarily true.
  - D: This is possible, but not necessarily true. Hidalgo's oil and watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil or watercolor, but they could be displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil or watercolor.
  - E: This is not necessarily true. Isaacs's watercolor could be displayed in the upper position of any of the four walls.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will display two paintings each (an oil and a watercolor) on four walls (1, 2, 3, and 4).
  - Each wall will have exactly two paintings (one in the upper position and one in the lower position).
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then Franz's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of that wall. Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of that wall. This means that Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on the remaining wall (since no wall can have only watercolors or only one student's work). Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of that wall. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, and the answer is (C).

  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.

Explanation: 
  According to the given conditions, the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the mystery cannot be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. along with the sci-fi film. Hence, option B cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.

  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.

  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 2 because the romance is not shown on screen 2. Therefore, options A, B, and C are possible lists of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2. 
  The western must be shown before the horror film, so option D is possible. 
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so option E is possible. 
  Therefore, the only option that cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 is option B, "the sci-fi film, the mystery".

Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.

  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the businesses in spaces 3 and 5 must not be a toy store or a veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 2 or 6, and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the pharmacy cannot be next to the toy store, it must be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the answer is B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
Response 1:

  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then we know that the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 1 and 7, because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Therefore, the two restaurants must be in spaces 2-3 and 5-6. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist. This means that the veterinarian must be in either space 5 or space 3. If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy would be next to the toy store, which is not allowed. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 3, and the pharmacy must be in space 2. This means that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, so the answer is B.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.

  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the businesses in spaces 3 and 5 must not be a toy store or a veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 2 or 6, and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the pharmacy cannot be next to the toy store, it must be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the answer is B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
Response 3:

  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the optometrist and the veterinarian cannot be in spaces 3 and 5, because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 3 or 5, and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the shoe store is in space 4, it cannot be next to the pharmacy. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, which means that the answer is B.
Response 4:

  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the businesses in spaces 3 and 5 must be determined. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so neither of the restaurants can be in space 3 or 5. Therefore, the restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 7. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it must be in space 1 or 7. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist must be in space 2 and the veterinarian in space 3. If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist must be in space 6 and the veterinarian in space 5. In either case, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer.

  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each of the three rugs must be either solid or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the third rug must be multicolored. 
  If the third rug contains both forest and peach, then neither forest nor peach can be used in a solid rug. 
  If the third rug contains both peach and turquoise, then neither peach nor turquoise can be used in a solid rug. 
  If the third rug contains both peach and yellow, then neither peach nor yellow can be used in a solid rug. 
  If the third rug contains both forest and turquoise, then neither forest nor turquoise can be used in a solid rug. 
  If the third rug contains both forest and yellow, then neither forest nor yellow can be used in a solid rug. 
  If the third rug contains both turquoise and yellow, then neither turquoise nor yellow can be used in a solid rug. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find two colors that cannot be used together in two solid rugs.
  Solid rugs are woven in a single color.
  We have six colors available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each solid rug must use exactly one color.
  We need to find two colors that cannot be used together in two solid rugs.
  
Analysis:
  Let's consider each option:
  A: forest and peach - These two colors can be used together in a rug. They are not excluded by any of the given rules.
  B: forest and yellow - These two colors can be used together in a rug. They are not excluded by any of the given rules.
  C: peach and turquoise - These two colors cannot be used together in a rug. They are excluded by the rule "Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug." However, we cannot have two solid rugs, one in peach and one in turquoise, because each color can be used in only one rug. Therefore, this option is not relevant.
  D: peach and yellow - These two colors cannot be used together in a rug. They are excluded by the rule "Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug." These two colors also cannot be used together in two solid rugs, because each color can be used in only one rug. Therefore, this is the correct answer.
  E: turquoise and yellow - These two colors can be used together in a rug. They are not excluded by any of the given rules.

  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. 
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member. 
  Therefore, the only way Verma can be the project leader is if Smith and Taylor are the other two project members and neither Ruiz nor Wells are selected.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.

  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Verma must be selected as a project member. 
  If Wells is selected as a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is selected as a project member, then Taylor must also be selected. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected as a project member, then he must be the project leader. Therefore, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member.
  Therefore, the only possible combination of project members is: Verma, Smith, and Taylor. In this case, Verma can be the project leader only if Smith or Taylor is not selected.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.

Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be project members. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
  Therefore, the possible combinations of project members are:
    1. Smith, Taylor, Verma
    2. Smith, Taylor, Wells

  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then she must be one of the three project members selected. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader. Therefore, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member.
  So, the three project members are Smith, Taylor, and Verma, and Verma is the project leader.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that either Jaramillo or Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela or Zambia. However, we cannot conclude which one of them it is. Therefore, we can only say that Jaramillo may or may not be assigned to an ambassadorship. Thus, the correct answer is D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that Jaramillo can be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia, but it is not a requirement for Jaramillo to be assigned to Venezuela. Therefore, it is possible that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that Jaramillo can be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, and Kayne can be assigned as ambassador to the other country. However, it is not necessary for Jaramillo to be assigned to an ambassadorship, so it is possible that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship. Therefore, (D) is the correct answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that Jaramillo can be assigned to Venezuela, and Landon can be assigned to Zambia. However, it is not clear whether Jaramillo will be assigned to an ambassadorship or not. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. Therefore, if Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then only Landon and Ong are left to be assigned to Zambia and Venezuela, respectively. However, if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship. Since Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen, he must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. But if Kayne is assigned to Venezuela, then Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela, which contradicts the given constraints. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to Zambia, and Landon must be assigned to Venezuela. This means that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, which is the answer (D).
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that Jaramillo can not be assigned to an ambassadorship because if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship. Therefore, Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, and the correct answer is D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that Jaramillo can be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, and Kayne can be assigned as ambassador to the other country. However, we cannot determine whether Landon or Ong will be assigned to the remaining country. Therefore, none of the options A, B, C, or E must be true. The only option that could be true is that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, so the correct answer is D.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. Therefore, Jaramillo can not be assigned to an ambassadorship because if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that either Jaramillo or Ong will be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. However, we cannot determine which one it will be. We also know that if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship. Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Jaramillo must be assigned to an ambassadorship as well. This eliminates choices B, C, and E. Since we cannot determine whether Jaramillo will be assigned to Venezuela or not, the only option that must be true is that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, which is answer choice D.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. Therefore, if Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then only Landon and Ong are left to be assigned to Zambia and Venezuela, respectively. This means that Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, so (A) is false. We know that Landon is assigned to Zambia if he is assigned to any ambassadorship, so (B) is not necessarily true. Ong cannot be assigned to Zambia because Landon is assigned to Zambia if he is assigned to any ambassadorship, so (C) is false. Therefore, (D) must be true. We cannot determine whether Ong is assigned to an ambassadorship or not, so (E) is not necessarily true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To determine who performs the third solo, we can use the following logic:
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does, so the percussionist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform the fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform the second, third, fourth, or fifth solo.
  
If the saxophonist performs the third solo, then the percussionist must perform the first solo, the keyboard player must perform the second solo, and the guitarist must perform the sixth solo. However, this violates the condition that the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are six solos performed by six members of a band.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: 
  The third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist (due to the first restriction) or the percussionist (due to the second restriction). 
  The third solo cannot be performed by the keyboard player (due to the third restriction). 
  The third solo cannot be performed by the saxophonist after the percussionist performs a solo (due to the fourth restriction). 
  The third solo cannot be performed by the saxophonist after the trumpeter performs a solo (due to the fourth restriction). 
  Therefore, the only option left is the violinist. 
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band, and each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  To perform the third solo, the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist or the trumpeter does. 
  The percussionist performs before the keyboard player does, so the saxophonist must perform before the keyboard player does. 
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist does, so the saxophonist must perform after the violinist does. 
  Therefore, the saxophonist must perform fourth or fifth. 
  The guitarist does not perform fourth, so the saxophonist must perform fourth. 
  Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The third solo must be performed after the percussionist and before the guitarist.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does, so the third solo cannot be performed by the keyboard player.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist can perform the third solo if the percussionist performs the first solo or the trumpeter performs the first solo.
  - The violinist can perform the third solo if the percussionist performs the first solo and the saxophonist performs the second solo.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Therefore, the guitarist cannot perform the third solo.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To determine who performs the third solo, we can use the following logic:
- The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so the percussionist cannot perform the third solo.
- The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo if the percussionist performs the first solo, because in that case the saxophonist would have to perform after both the percussionist and the trumpeter.
- The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
- The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, so the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo.
- Therefore, the only member who can perform the third solo is either the guitarist or the keyboard player.

Action: Answer("C") - saxophonist
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band and each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  The third solo can be performed by either the percussionist or the trumpeter, since the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, or E.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist, because the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the keyboard player, because the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the saxophonist, because the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the trumpeter, because there is no restriction on the trumpeter's performance.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the violinist, because the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To determine who performs the third solo, we can use the following logic:
- The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so they must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
- The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does, so they must perform either the first or second solo.
- The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. This means that the keyboard player must perform the third solo, since the violinist must perform before them and the guitarist must perform after them.
- The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. This means that the saxophonist must perform either the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.

Therefore, the saxophonist could potentially perform the third solo, so the answer is not C. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To determine who performs the third solo, we can use the following logic:
  - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so the percussionist cannot perform the third solo.
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, so the saxophonist can perform the third solo only if the percussionist or the trumpeter performs the first and the other performs the second.
  - The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, so the keyboard player can perform the third solo only if the violinist performs the first and the guitarist performs the second.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist can perform the third solo only if the violinist performs the first and the keyboard player performs the second.
  - The violinist can perform the third solo only if the percussionist performs the first and the saxophonist performs the second, or if the trumpeter performs the first and the saxophonist performs the second.

Action: Answer("D") 

Therefore, the only member who cannot perform the third solo is the trumpeter, so the answer is D.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are six solos, one for each member of the band.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, so the possible solos for the guitarist are 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, so the possible solos for the percussionist are 1, 2, and 3.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does, so the possible solos for the keyboard player are 4 and 6.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both, so the possible solos for the saxophonist are 4, 5, and 6.
  Therefore, the only member who cannot perform the third solo is the guitarist, because the possible solos for the guitarist are 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, and the third solo is not one of them.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section to satisfy the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, it follows that Fuentes must have exactly one photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon to satisfy the condition that each photographer can have at most three photographs in total. Thus, the answer is B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there are two possibilities for the third photographer in the Lifestyle section: Fuentes or Gagnon. However, since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and Gagnon already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, Gagnon must also have a photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Choice B is the correct answer.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then it means that the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Fuentes or Gagnon. Since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, it follows that the photograph in the Lifestyle section that is not by Gagnon or Hue must be by Fuentes. Therefore, Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section and at least one photograph in the Metro section. This means that Fuentes cannot have more than one photograph in the Sports section. Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, it follows that Hue can have at most one photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Answer: B

Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes. This means that Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section and at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, so if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon (choice B). It is not necessarily true that exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue (choice D) or that both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon (choice C) or that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue (choice E).
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) will have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes. This means that Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section and at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, Fuentes cannot have both photographs in the Sports section. Since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, and Hue has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, it must be Fuentes who has the same number of photographs in the Sports section as Hue has in the Lifestyle section. This means that Fuentes has exactly one photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon. Thus, the answer is B.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six different photographs, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
- There must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes.
- There must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes.
- There cannot be any photographs by Gagnon in the Sports section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

Analysis of choices:
  A: This statement may or may not be true. There is no direct relationship between the number of Fuentes photographs in the Metro section and the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  B: This statement may or may not be true. There is no direct relationship between the number of Gagnon photographs in the Metro section and the number of Gagnon photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  C: This statement cannot be true. If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there cannot be two photographs by Gagnon in the Metro section.
  D: This statement may or may not be true. There is a relationship between the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section and the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, but it is not clear whether there must be exactly one photograph by Hue in the Sports section.
  E: This statement cannot be true. If the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, then there cannot be both photographs in the Sports section by Hue.

Action: Answer("D")

Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - There are three batches of each type of cookie made each week.
  - Each batch is made on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible batches that can be made on Tuesday and Thursday.

  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible batches that can be made on Tuesday and Thursday.
  - Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the only possible batches that can be made on Thursday are oatmeal and peanut butter.
  - Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  - If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the only possible batches that can be made on Tuesday are oatmeal and peanut butter.
  - Therefore, the only possible batches that can be made on Friday are oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then the only possible batches that can be made on Monday are oatmeal and peanut butter.
  - Therefore, the only possible batches that can be made on Friday are oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - In either case, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then:
- The first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.
- The first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.
- The first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday.

If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. This means that all batches of cookies are made and there is no day without any batch of cookies. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.

If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. This means that there are no batches of cookies made on Wednesday. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday or Tuesday. This means that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. Therefore, the answer is B.

Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday. Since exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, this means that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. Answer("A")

  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams, one with two members and the other with three members.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members and the red team must have two members.
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the red team with Juana.
  Mei is the only person left and must be assigned to the green team as a facilitator.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:

  - One team has two members, and the other has three members.
  - One member of each team is a facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Analysis:
  - Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team has three members and the red team has two members.
  - Since Olga is a facilitator, she must be on the green team.
  - Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, Juana must be on the red team.
  - Since Kelly is not a facilitator, Mei must be the other facilitator.
  - Therefore, D is true because Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members, and the red team must have two members. 
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the red team.
  Mei is the only student left, so she must be assigned to the green team and be a facilitator.
  Therefore, Lateefah and Mei are facilitators, and Juana is assigned to the red team.
  
Action: Answer("D")

  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Kelly must be assigned to the green team along with Lateefah and Olga. 
  Mei is the only person left and must be assigned to the red team. 
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  Two teams: green team and red team.
  One team has two members, and the other has three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as a facilitator.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Since Olga is a facilitator, she must be on a team with either Lateefah or Mei. Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga, Juana must be on a team with Kelly. Therefore, Juana and Mei are on the same team, and they cannot both be facilitators. So, D is the correct answer.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams, one with two members and the other with three members.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members and the red team must have two members.
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Kelly must be assigned to the red team.
  Mei is the only student left and must be assigned to the green team, but we don't know if she is a facilitator or not.

Action: Answer("A")  
  Juana is assigned to the red team.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members, and the red team must have two members. 
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the green team. 
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so Juana must be assigned to the red team. 
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Kelly must be assigned to the green team. 
  Mei is the only student left, so she must be assigned to the red team. 
  Therefore, Lateefah and Kelly are assigned to the green team, and Olga, Juana, and Mei are assigned to the red team. 
  Thus, the correct answer is D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.

Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members, and the red team must have two members. 
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Kelly must be assigned to the red team.
  Mei is the only student left, so she must be assigned to the green team and be a facilitator.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are both facilitators, so D is false.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  - There are two teams: the green team and the red team.
  - One team has two members, and the other has three members.
  - One member of each team is a facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Analysis:
  - Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members and the red team must have two members.
  - Since Olga is a facilitator, she must be on the green team with Lateefah.
  - Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, Juana must be on the red team.
  - Since Kelly is not a facilitator, Mei must be the other facilitator.
  - Therefore, D must be true.

  D: The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening, and both N and O are not among the houses to be shown. Therefore, D is not true.
  E: L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Both N and P are not among the houses to be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, E is not true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses during a single day, with specific rules for when each house can be shown.
  J must be shown in the evening, which means it will be the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, which means it will be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, which means it will be the fourth or fifth house shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, which means they cannot be J or K.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening, which means they must be J and one other house.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  J must be shown in the evening, which means it will be the sixth or seventh house shown. Therefore, P could be shown at some time after J is shown. 
  K cannot be shown in the morning, which means it will be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house shown. Therefore, we cannot conclude that K is shown at some time after J is shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, which means it will be the fourth or fifth house shown. Therefore, we can conclude that L is shown at some time after J is shown.
  Both N and O are not mentioned in the context, so we cannot conclude that they are shown at some time after M is shown.
  Both N and P are not mentioned in the context, so we cannot conclude that they are shown at some time after K is shown.

  B: If L is shown at some time after J is shown, then J cannot be shown in the evening, which violates the rule that J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: P can be shown at some time after J is shown because there are no rules that prevent P from being shown at any time. Therefore, C could be true.
  D: The rule does not specify when N and O should be shown, so it is possible that both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown. Therefore, D could be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Solution:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it must have traded all of its buildings away. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp does not own any buildings anymore. 
  This means that Trustcorp did not trade with Southco, because Southco still owns buildings. 
  Also, Trustcorp did not trade with RealProp, because RealProp owns only one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings. 
  Therefore, none of the trades involved Trustcorp. 
  This means that Trustcorp still owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower or the Zimmer House. 
  Also, Southco does not own only class 2 buildings, because it still owns a class 1 building. 
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).

Action: Answer("B")  
If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means that Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings. Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it means that Trustcorp has no buildings left. Therefore, Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  
Analysis:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, so it cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded a class 2 building for one or more class 1 buildings or for one or more class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp traded a class 2 building for one or more class 1 buildings, then RealProp must own a class 1 building, which would make option A true.
  If Trustcorp traded a class 2 building for one or more class 2 buildings, then Southco must own at least one class 2 building, which would make option B false.
  If Trustcorp traded a class 2 building for one or more class 1 buildings, then Southco must have made at least one trade with Trustcorp, which would make option C true.
  The Garza Tower is a class 1 building owned by RealProp, so option D is false.
  The Zimmer House is a class 3 building owned by RealProp, so option E is false.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Solution:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded away all of its class 2 buildings.
  The only way for Trustcorp to trade away all of its class 2 buildings is to trade each of them for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have made at least one trade with RealProp or Southco, who own class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp made a trade with RealProp, then RealProp must have traded a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, which is not possible since RealProp owns only one class 1 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have made a trade with Southco, who owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  This means that Southco must have traded its class 2 building for two of Trustcorp's class 3 buildings.
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it must have traded the class 2 building for two of its own class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Solution:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it must have traded all of its buildings away. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded two class 2 buildings for either two class 3 buildings or one class 1 building and one class 3 building. 
  If Trustcorp traded two class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, then Southco must have received one of the class 3 buildings, which means Southco owns both a class 2 building and a class 3 building. 
  This contradicts the fact that Southco owns only a class 1 building and a class 2 building. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded two class 2 buildings for one class 1 building and one class 3 building. 
  This means that RealProp owns a class 1 building, and Trustcorp owns the two class 3 buildings. 
  Southco must have made a trade with Trustcorp to receive the class 1 building, so C is true. 
  A, B, D, and E are all false.

    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Solution:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it must have traded all of its buildings away. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp does not own any buildings anymore. 
  This means that Trustcorp did not trade with Southco, because Southco still owns buildings. 
  Also, Trustcorp did not trade with RealProp, because RealProp owns only one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings. 
  Therefore, none of the trades involved Trustcorp. 
  This means that Trustcorp still owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower or the Zimmer House. 
  Also, Southco does not own only class 2 buildings, because it still owns a class 1 building. 
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is that RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  
Action: Answer("A")

    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class

    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Solution:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it must have traded all of its buildings away. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded two class 2 buildings for either two class 3 buildings or one class 1 building and one class 3 building. 
  If Trustcorp traded two class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, then Southco must have received one of the class 3 buildings, which means Southco owns both a class 2 building and a class 3 building. 
  This contradicts the fact that Southco owns only a class 1 building and a class 2 building. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded two class 2 buildings for one class 1 building and one class 3 building. 
  This means RealProp owns the class 1 building, and Trustcorp owns only the class 3 buildings. 
  Thus, the only statement that must be true is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")

    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Solution:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it must have traded all of its buildings away. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded at least one class 2 building to either RealProp or Southco. 
  If Trustcorp traded a class 2 building to RealProp, then RealProp would own a class 2 building, which contradicts the given information. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded a class 2 building to Southco. 
  This means that Southco owns two class 2 buildings, which contradicts the given information that Southco owns only one class 2 building. 
  Therefore, it is impossible for Trustcorp to own no class 2 buildings after some number of trades. 
  None of the choices are true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Solution:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it must have traded all of its buildings away. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded with either RealProp or Southco. 
  If Trustcorp traded with RealProp, then RealProp must have traded a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, which is not possible since RealProp owns only one class 1 building. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded with Southco. 
  This means that Southco must have traded a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, which implies that Southco owns at least one class 3 building. 
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is: 
  Action: Answer("E") Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for other buildings.
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building, but it is not necessarily true that Trustcorp's trades have anything to do with RealProp's buildings.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings is not possible because Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1).
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp is possible, but it is not necessarily true.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower is not possible because RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1).
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House is possible, but it is not necessarily true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four.

Analysis:
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots two and three in some order. Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot five because it is one of the last three slots. 
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Vegemite cannot perform in slot three. 
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring cannot perform in slot three. 
  - Zircon must perform in slot two, and Uneasy must perform in slot four or six. 
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, Zircon performs in slot two, which is the correct answer.

  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so it cannot be in slot six.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it cannot be in slot one or two.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so it cannot be in slot five or six.
  - Therefore, Vegemite must be in slot three or four.
  - If Vegemite is in slot three, then Uneasy cannot be in slot five, because Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
  - Therefore, if Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Uneasy must perform in slot six.

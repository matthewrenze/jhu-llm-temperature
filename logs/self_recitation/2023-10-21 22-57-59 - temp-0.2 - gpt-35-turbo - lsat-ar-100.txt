Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  5 students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review 1 or more of exactly 3 plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review Tamerlane.
  If Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then the remaining student (who does not review Tamerlane) must review Undulation.
  If Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, then Megregian must review Tamerlane and Undulation.
  If neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, then Jiang cannot review Tamerlane or Undulation.
  
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation. (This cannot be true because if exactly three students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review Tamerlane. If Megregian does not review Undulation, then Megregian must review Sunset, which is not possible because exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.)
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. (This can be true because if exactly three students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review Tamerlane. If Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then O'Neill cannot review Undulation.)
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation. (This cannot be true because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and if exactly three students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review Tamerlane. Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane or Undulation.)
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. (This cannot be true because if exactly three students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review Tamerlane. If Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then Lopez cannot review Tamerlane.)
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. (This cannot be true because if exactly three students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review Tamerlane. If Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then O'Neill cannot review Sunset.) 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  5 students review 1 or more of 3 plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  If Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then the third student who reviews Tamerlane must be either Jiang, Lopez, or Megregian.
  If neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, then Jiang cannot review Tamerlane, which means that either Lopez or Megregian must review Tamerlane.
  
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation. This cannot be true because we know that exactly three students review Undulation, and if Megregian does not review Undulation, then only two students would be reviewing Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. This could be true because we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, which means that they cannot both review Undulation. If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then the other two students who review Tamerlane must be among the three who review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation. This cannot be true because we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and we already established that one of them must review Tamerlane.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. This could be true because we know that exactly three students review Undulation, and if neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews Undulation, then they must both review Tamerlane along with either Jiang, Kramer, or O'Neill.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. This cannot be true because we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and we already established that the third student who reviews Tamerlane must be among the three who review Undulation.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three of the students review Undulation.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  A: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and Megregian does not review Undulation, then the other two students who did not review Undulation must be Lopez and Kramer. However, this would mean that Lopez and Megregian reviewed the same plays, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  B: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and O'Neill does not review Undulation, then the other two students who did not review Undulation must be Kramer and Lopez. This means that Megregian must have reviewed Undulation, and since Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane, Jiang must have reviewed Sunset. This satisfies all the given conditions, so this could be true.
  C: If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation, which means that Kramer and O'Neill must have reviewed Undulation. However, this would mean that Kramer and O'Neill reviewed the same plays, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  D: If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then O'Neill and Kramer must review Tamerlane as well. This means that Megregian cannot review Tamerlane, which means that Megregian must review Undulation. However, this would mean that Lopez and Megregian reviewed the same plays, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  E: If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer must review Sunset as well. This means that Megregian cannot review Sunset, which means that Megregian must review Undulation. However, this would mean that Kramer and Megregian reviewed the same plays, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must have reviewed the same play or plays as each other.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot review Undulation, which means that the two students who reviewed the same play or plays as each other cannot have reviewed Undulation. This contradicts the given information that exactly three students reviewed Undulation. Therefore, Megregian cannot review Undulation.
  If O'Neill reviews Undulation, then Kramer and Lopez must have reviewed Tamerlane. This means that Megregian must have reviewed Sunset, which contradicts the given information that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, O'Neill cannot review Undulation.
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must have reviewed the same play or plays as each other. This means that they both reviewed Tamerlane, which satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, Jiang could review Undulation.
  If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian must review Sunset, which contradicts the given information that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, Lopez cannot review Tamerlane.
  If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer and Lopez must have reviewed Tamerlane. This means that Megregian must have reviewed Undulation, which contradicts the given information that exactly three students reviewed Undulation. Therefore, O'Neill cannot review Sunset.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Five students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review one or more of exactly three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the two remaining students must review the same play or plays as each other. 
  A: If Megregian does not review Undulation, then he must review the same play or plays as the two remaining students. This would mean that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, which is not possible. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then he must review the same play or plays as the two remaining students. This would mean that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, which is not possible. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation. This means that they must review the same play or plays as each other. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, this would mean that the two remaining students (Lopez and Megregian) review Sunset. This satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, C could be true.
  D: If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian and O'Neill must review Undulation. This means that Kramer must review Sunset. However, this would mean that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, which is not possible. Therefore, D is not true.
  E: If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then he must review the same play or plays as the two remaining students. This would mean that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, which is not possible. Therefore, E is not true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  5 students review 1 or more of 3 plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must review Tamerlane or Sunset.
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian, so Megregian must review all three plays.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
  Jiang reviews Undulation.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  - Three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Each student reviews one or more of the three plays.
  - Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other.
  - Three students review Undulation.
  
Analysis:
  - If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they are two of the students who review the same play or plays as each other.
  - Therefore, the third student who reviews Undulation must be one of the students who reviews the same play or plays as Kramer and O'Neill.
  - Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, so Megregian cannot be the student who reviews Undulation and the same play or plays as Kramer and O'Neill.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot be the student who reviews Undulation and the same play or plays as Kramer and O'Neill.
  - Therefore, the only possibility is that O'Neill is the student who reviews Undulation and the same play or plays as Kramer.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  5 students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review 1 or more of 3 plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly 2 students review the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly 3 students review Undulation, then the other 2 students must review Tamerlane.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly 3 students review Undulation, then the other 2 students must review Tamerlane. We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be either Kramer or O'Neill. Therefore, Megregian must be the student who reviews Undulation along with two other students who review the same play or plays as each other. Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang cannot be one of the students who review Undulation. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  
Action: Answer("B")

  A: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. Therefore, Megregian must review Undulation. This choice is not possible.
  B: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. Therefore, O'Neill must review Tamerlane and not Undulation. This choice is possible.
  C: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot review Undulation. This choice is not possible.
  D: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, Lopez cannot review Tamerlane. This choice is possible.
  E: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. Therefore, O'Neill cannot review Sunset. This choice is possible.
  
Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We need to determine which of the answer choices could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made.
  
Analysis:
  Option A is not possible because RealProp does not own the Flores Tower and Southco does not own the King Building or the Ortiz Building.
  Option B is not possible because RealProp does not own the King Building or the Ortiz Building, and Trustcorp does not own the Yates House or the Zimmer House.
  Option C is possible because RealProp could trade the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower, Southco could trade the Lynch Building for the Yates House and the Zimmer House, and Trustcorp could trade the King Building for the two class 3 buildings.
  Option D is not possible because RealProp does not own the Meyer Building, and Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.
  Option E is not possible because RealProp does not own the Lynch Building, and Southco does not own the Yates House or the Zimmer House.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  After only one trade is made, each company will still own three buildings.
  If a class 1 building is traded, the company must receive two class 2 buildings in return.
  If a class 2 building is traded, the company must receive two class 3 buildings in return.
  
Analysis:
  RealProp has one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  To make a trade, one company must give up a building and receive one or two buildings in return.
  Since each company must still own three buildings after the trade, the only way to do this is to trade one building for two buildings of a lower class or one building of the same class.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is for RealProp to trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings.
  This means that Trustcorp must give up two class 2 buildings and receive the Garza Tower (class 1).
  The only way to do this is for Trustcorp to trade the King Building and the Ortiz Building for the Garza Tower.
  This leaves Trustcorp with the Meyer Building and RealProp with the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
  Southco cannot be involved in this trade because it does not have any class 2 buildings to trade.

Action: Answer("B")

Analysis:
  RealProp has one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  To make a trade, each company must give up one building and receive one or two buildings in return.
  Therefore, after one trade, each company will still have only three buildings, and the total number of buildings in each class will remain the same.

A: RealProp would have two class 1 buildings and one class 3 building, which is impossible after one trade.
B: RealProp would have one building of each class, which is impossible after one trade.
C: RealProp would have one class 1 building and one class 2 building, which is impossible after one trade.

  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then:
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, so W must be mentioned in chapter 6 or later.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 5, 6, or 7, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6.

Checking the choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1. This is possible, as long as S and Z are not mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5. This is not possible, as R cannot be mentioned in chapter 5 if U is mentioned in chapter 3.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7. This is possible, as long as Z is not mentioned in chapter 6.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6. This is possible, as long as T is mentioned in chapter 2 and S and Z are not mentioned in adjacent chapters.

To determine which of the choices could be true, we need to use the given constraints and the fact that U is mentioned in chapter 3. We can use the constraints to eliminate some of the choices.

Eliminate A: If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, which means that T cannot be mentioned before W. This violates the constraint that T must be mentioned before W.

Eliminate B: If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, which violates the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and must be mentioned before W.

Eliminate C: If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Eliminate D: If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4, which violates the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.

That leaves us with only one choice, which could be true:

Action: Answer("E")  
Choice E: X is mentioned in chapter 4. If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5, which satisfies the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so they must be mentioned in chapters 1-3 and 5-7, in some order.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so they must be mentioned in chapters 3-5, in some order.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3 and X is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so they must be mentioned in chapters 1-3 and 5-7, in some order.
  - R must be mentioned in chapter 7, since it is the only clue left. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6, leaving chapter 5 for R.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
  From condition 3, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, the other student who reviews Tamerlane must be one of Jiang, Lopez, or Megregian.
  From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
  From condition 4, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian must review all three plays, and Kramer and Lopez each review only one of the three plays.
  
Test of the choices:
  A: Jiang cannot review Tamerlane. Incorrect.
  B: Correct. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  C: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, but Lopez cannot review Tamerlane. Incorrect.
  D: Megregian must review all three plays, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
  E: Megregian must review all three plays, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 

Using condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, the other student who reviews Tamerlane must be one of the students who reviews the same play or plays as another student.

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot be one of the students who reviews Tamerlane.

Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian must review all three plays, and Kramer and Lopez each review only one or two plays.

From the above analysis, we can conclude that the only possible list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 

Using condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and E because they only have one student reviewing Tamerlane.

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, we can eliminate option D because it includes Megregian who reviews Tamerlane and Jiang who does not review any play reviewed by Lopez or Megregian.

Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, we can eliminate option C because it includes Lopez who reviews more plays than Megregian.

Action: Answer("B")  
Option B is the only option left, and it satisfies all the given conditions.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 

Using condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and E because they only have one student reviewing Tamerlane.

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, we can eliminate choice D because it includes Megregian.

Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, we can eliminate choice C because it includes Lopez.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using the given conditions, we can eliminate some of the choices:
- A: Jiang cannot review Tamerlane because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- E: Lopez and Megregian cannot review Tamerlane because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- C: Kramer and Lopez cannot both review Tamerlane because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.

Therefore, the answer is either B or D. 

Option D is possible because it includes Kramer and O'Neill who both review Tamerlane, and Megregian who reviews at least one of the three plays. 

Option B is also possible because it includes Kramer and O'Neill who both review Tamerlane. However, we do not know if Jiang, Lopez, or Megregian review the same play as Kramer and O'Neill, so we cannot say for sure if it is a complete list.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.

Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So, any option that does not include both Kramer and O'Neill is incorrect.
  From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So, option A is incorrect.
  From condition 3, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. So, option D is incorrect as it has three students reviewing Tamerlane.
  From condition 4, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. So, option B is incorrect as it does not include Megregian.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 

Using condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and E because they only have one student reviewing Tamerlane.

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, we can eliminate choice D because it includes Megregian who reviews Tamerlane and Jiang who does not review any play reviewed by Lopez or Megregian.

Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, we can eliminate choice C because it includes Lopez who reviews more plays than Megregian.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
  From condition 3, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. 
  Therefore, the third student who reviews Tamerlane must be one of the students who review exactly the same play or plays as each other. 
  From condition 4, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. 
  Therefore, Megregian must be the fourth student who reviews Tamerlane. 
  From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. 
  Therefore, Jiang cannot be the fifth student who reviews Tamerlane.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - Each student reviews one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, they must be part of the two students who review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - Therefore, the other students must review Sunset and Undulation.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must review either Sunset or Undulation.
  - Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, Megregian must review all three plays.
  - Therefore, the only possible list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 

Using condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, the other student(s) who review Tamerlane must be one of the students who review one or both of the other two plays.

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot be one of the students who review Tamerlane.

Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian must review all three plays, and Kramer and Lopez must each review only one of the three plays.

From the above analysis, we can conclude that the only possible list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill.

  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Elimination:

  The organizer must select at least 3 novels, and there are a total of 6 novels to choose from (3 French and 3 Russian). Therefore, the organizer must select either 3 French novels or 3 Russian novels, or 2 French novels and 1 Russian novel, or 1 French novel and 2 Russian novels.
  The organizer cannot select both French plays and the Russian play, so the organizer must select either one French play and no Russian play, or no French play and the Russian play.
  If the organizer selects one French play and no Russian play, then the organizer can select at most 3 French novels (because no more than 4 French works are selected), and therefore must select at least 2 Russian novels.
  If the organizer selects no French play and the Russian play, then the organizer can select at most 4 French novels, and therefore must select at least 2 French novels.

Elimination:
  We can eliminate option B because it violates the rule that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  We can eliminate option C because it violates the rule that if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
  We can eliminate option D because it violates the rule that no more than four French works are selected.
  
Analysis:
  Option A requires the selection of one French novel and one French play, which would mean that at least three French works are selected. This violates the rule that no more than four French works are selected. Therefore, option A is not correct.
  Option E requires the selection of two Russian novels, which satisfies the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. However, it does not satisfy the requirement that at least three but no more than four novels are selected. Therefore, option E is not correct.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above") 
None of the above options are correct. The organizer must select at least three novels, which means that options A and E are incorrect. The organizer must also select no more than four French works, which means that option D is incorrect. The only options that satisfy these requirements are:
- Three novels (at least one French novel and at least one Russian novel) and two French plays
- Four novels (at least two French novels and at least two Russian novels) and one French play

  We can eliminate option E because it only requires the selection of two Russian novels, and the organizer must select at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Option D requires the selection of two French novels, which satisfies the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels. Additionally, the organizer must select at least 3 novels, and selecting two French novels and one Russian novel satisfies this requirement. Finally, selecting both French plays would violate the requirement that the Russian play cannot be selected, so the organizer must select at least one French play, which is consistent with selecting two French novels. Therefore, the organizer must select at least two French novels.

- At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected, so the organizer must select at least 2 French novels and 1 Russian novel.
- No more than 4 French works can be selected, so the organizer can select at most 2 French plays and 2 French novels.
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected, so the organizer must select at most 1 French play.

Solution:
- The organizer must select at least 2 French novels, 1 Russian novel, 1 French play, and 1 Russian play to satisfy the requirements.
- Therefore, the answer is not listed among the choices.

  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Elimination:
  We can eliminate options A, B, and C because they only require the selection of two works, which is not enough to meet the requirement of selecting at least 5 works.
  We can eliminate option E because it only requires the selection of two Russian novels, which does not meet the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels.

Solution:
  Option D requires the selection of two French novels, which is possible since no more than four French works can be selected. Additionally, the requirement of selecting at least 3 but no more than 4 novels is met by selecting two French novels and two Russian novels. Finally, the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels is met by selecting two French novels and two Russian novels. Therefore, the answer is D.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Five witnesses (Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson) are scheduled to testify at a hearing.
  - The hearing is to take exactly three days of one week (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday (because Hong does not testify on Monday). Therefore, Franco must testify on Wednesday (the only remaining day). Since Franco and Hong testify on the same day, Hong must also testify on Wednesday. Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday, so there are no other witnesses left to testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Garcia and Jackson must testify on Monday and Tuesday (in some order). Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Garcia and Jackson must testify on Tuesday and Monday (in some order). Thus, the schedule must be one of the following:
  
  Monday: Garcia, Jackson
  Tuesday: Hong, Iturbe
  Wednesday: Franco
  
  OR
  
  Monday: Jackson, Garcia
  Tuesday: Hong, Iturbe
  Wednesday: Franco
  
  Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing takes exactly 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday because Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday. This means that Hong cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco and Hong cannot testify on the same day. Therefore, Hong must testify on Wednesday. Since Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday, Garcia must testify on Monday. This leaves Jackson to testify on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("C") - Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing takes exactly three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday, and Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday. Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, so Garcia must testify on Monday and Franco must testify on Wednesday. At least one witness must testify on Monday, so Jackson must testify on Monday. 
  
  A: Franco cannot testify on Wednesday because he must testify on Tuesday.
  B: Garcia must testify on Monday, not Wednesday.
  C: Garcia cannot testify on Wednesday because he must testify on Monday.
  D: This is true. Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday.
  E: This is not necessarily true. Iturbe is the only witness who must testify on Wednesday, but other witnesses may also testify on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.

  - Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe would have to testify on Monday, which is not allowed because Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday. Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Hong must also testify on Tuesday. Garcia cannot testify on Monday because at least one witness must testify on Monday and Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Wednesday. Iturbe is the only witness left to testify on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing takes exactly three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  - If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on the same day as Franco.
  - Therefore, Franco and Hong must both testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  - If Franco and Hong both testify on Tuesday, then Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, and Garcia and Jackson must testify on Monday. This satisfies all the conditions.
  - If Franco and Hong both testify on Wednesday, then Iturbe must also testify on Wednesday, which violates the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Therefore, Franco and Hong must both testify on Tuesday.
  - If Franco and Hong both testify on Tuesday, then Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, and Garcia and Jackson must testify on Monday. This satisfies all the conditions.

  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  - If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  - If Hong testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe must testify on Monday or Tuesday, but Iturbe cannot testify on Tuesday because exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Therefore, Iturbe must testify on Monday, and Hong must testify on Tuesday.
  - Franco cannot testify on Wednesday because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Therefore, Franco must testify on Monday, and Garcia must testify on Wednesday because Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, if Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Garcia must be scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 6:

  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  - If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday, since Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  - If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia cannot testify on Monday, since Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. This means that Garcia must testify on Wednesday. However, this would mean that there are three witnesses testifying on Wednesday (Iturbe, Franco, and Garcia), which contradicts the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Franco cannot testify on Tuesday.
  - If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe must testify on Tuesday, since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. This means that Garcia must testify on Monday, since Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. Finally, Hong must testify on Tuesday, since Hong does not testify on Monday and Iturbe and Garcia are already scheduled for Monday and Wednesday, respectively.
  - Therefore, if Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Garcia must be scheduled to testify on Monday.
  
Action: Answer("B")

  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, which contradicts the condition that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday. Garcia cannot testify on Monday because at least one witness must testify on Monday and Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Wednesday. Iturbe is the only witness left to testify on Monday.
  
Action: Answer("C")

  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday (because Hong does not testify on Monday). Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe would have to testify on Monday or Tuesday, which is not allowed because Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday. This means that Hong cannot testify on Tuesday (because Franco and Hong cannot testify on the same day), so Hong must testify on Monday. Garcia cannot testify on Monday (because Garcia and Franco cannot testify on the same day), so Garcia must testify on Wednesday. This leaves Jackson to testify on Tuesday.
  
  A: Franco must testify on Tuesday, not Wednesday.
  B: Garcia testifies on Wednesday, not Monday.
  C: Garcia testifies on Wednesday, not Monday.
  D: Hong testifies on Monday, not Tuesday.
  E: We know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, but we do not know if Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.

  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, which contradicts the condition that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday.
  
  If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Hong cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco and Hong cannot testify on the same day. Therefore, Hong must testify on Monday or Wednesday. However, if Hong testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, which contradicts the condition that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Monday.
  
  If Hong testifies on Monday and Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia cannot testify on Monday or Tuesday because Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Wednesday.
  
  Therefore, the schedule must be: 
  Monday: Hong, Garcia, and one other witness
  Tuesday: Franco and one other witness
  Wednesday: Iturbe and one other witness
  
  The only option that is true of the schedule is that Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is (C) Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.

Analysis:
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Young cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, so the remaining parking spaces available for Young are #5 and #6.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  - Based on the above rules, we can eliminate options A and E.
  - Option B violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Option C satisfies all the rules and is a valid assignment of parking spaces.

  The rules state that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  
Analysis:
  According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, options A and E are eliminated because Robertson is not assigned to any of those parking spaces. 
  Option B is eliminated because Young is assigned to parking space #3, which is lower than Togowa's parking space #2.
  Option C is eliminated because Xu is assigned to parking space #3, which is lower than Souza's parking space #2.
  Option D satisfies all the rules and is a valid assignment of parking spaces.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  - Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  
Analysis:
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, options A, B, and E are incorrect because Robertson is not assigned to one of these spaces.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, option C is incorrect because Togowa is assigned to space #1, which is higher than space #2 assigned to Young.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, option D is incorrect because Souza is assigned to space #1, which is higher than space #6 assigned to Xu.
  - The only option left is B, which satisfies all the given conditions.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The rules for assigning parking spaces are:
  - Young > Togowa
  - Xu > Souza
  - Robertson > Young
  - Robertson in {1, 2, 3, 4}
  
  A: Young is assigned parking space #1, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  B: The order of parking spaces assigned to Young and Togowa violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  C: This assignment satisfies all the rules.
  D: Robertson is assigned parking space #2, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  E: Xu is assigned parking space #5, which violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are 6 lab sessions: 3 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon.
  3. Each lab assistant leads one morning and one afternoon session.
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  6. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  7. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the following:
  1. Julio cannot lead the Friday afternoon session because Olivia's session must meet on a later day of the week than Julio's.
  2. Nessa cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because Nessa must lead an afternoon session and we already know that Julio is leading the Thursday afternoon session.
  3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead the Thursday morning session because they cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead the Wednesday morning and afternoon sessions or the Thursday morning and afternoon sessions. If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday morning and afternoon sessions.
  
  Therefore, we can determine the lab sessions led by the following lab assistants:
  - Julio: Thursday afternoon
  - Kevin: Wednesday morning and Wednesday afternoon
  - Rebecca: Wednesday morning and Wednesday afternoon
  - Nessa: Friday afternoon
  
  We cannot determine the lab sessions led by Lan and Olivia.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are 6 lab sessions: 3 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday.
  
Analysis:
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday, and Julio's session must be on Wednesday.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Wednesday afternoon session.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead the Thursday morning session.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan must lead the Friday morning session.
  - This leaves only one session, the Friday afternoon session, which must be led by the remaining lab assistant, which is either Julio or Nessa.
  - Therefore, we can determine the sessions led by all lab assistants except for one.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one session per day.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session. This is because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, and Thursday is earlier than Friday. Also, Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so Nessa cannot lead the Friday afternoon session. Therefore, the Friday morning session must be led by either Kevin or Rebecca. However, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Kevin or Rebecca must also lead the Thursday morning session. This leaves only the Wednesday morning and afternoon sessions, which must be led by Lan and Nessa (in some order), since Olivia cannot lead a session on Wednesday and Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. Therefore, we can determine which sessions are led by Lan, Nessa, Kevin, Rebecca, and Olivia, for a total of 5 lab assistants. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach:
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, but we don't know which day yet.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session, but we don't know which day yet.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so Lan's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday morning, and Olivia's session must be on Thursday or Friday morning.
  - We can determine which sessions Lan and Olivia lead, so we need to check the possible cases for Kevin and Rebecca's sessions to see how many other lab assistants' sessions we can determine.
  - If Kevin and Rebecca's sessions are on Wednesday, then Nessa's session must be on Thursday afternoon, and we can determine Kevin, Rebecca, Nessa, Lan, and Olivia's sessions. Therefore, the answer is 5.
  - If Kevin and Rebecca's sessions are on Friday, then Nessa's session must be on Thursday afternoon, and we can determine Kevin, Rebecca, Nessa, Lan, and Olivia's sessions. Therefore, the answer is 5.
  - If Kevin and Rebecca's sessions are on Thursday, then Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon, and we can determine Kevin, Rebecca, Nessa, Lan, and Olivia's sessions. Therefore, the answer is 5.

Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then:
  1. Julio's session is already determined.
  2. Olivia's session must be on Friday (because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's).
  3. Nessa's session must be on Thursday afternoon (because Nessa must lead an afternoon session).
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and that day cannot be Thursday (because Nessa is already leading the Thursday afternoon session). Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Wednesday or Friday.
  5. Lan's session cannot be on Thursday (because Olivia is already leading the Thursday afternoon session), so Lan's session must be on Wednesday or Friday.
  
  Therefore, for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
  1. Julio's session is already determined.
  2. Olivia's session is already determined.
  3. Nessa's session is already determined.
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Wednesday or Friday, but we do not know which one each will lead.
  5. Lan's session must be on Wednesday or Friday, but we do not know which one.
  
  So, we can determine the sessions for three of the other lab assistants: Julio, Olivia, and Nessa.

  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach:
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must be on Wednesday or Thursday.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Wednesday or Thursday afternoon session.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan must lead the Wednesday morning session.
  - That leaves Kevin to lead the Thursday morning session and Rebecca to lead the Friday afternoon session.
  - Therefore, we can determine the sessions led by all the lab assistants except for Nessa.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day of Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the following:
    - Julio's session is on Thursday afternoon.
    - Olivia's session is on Friday (since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's).
    - Nessa's session is on Wednesday afternoon (since Nessa must lead an afternoon session and there is only one afternoon session left).
    - Kevin and Rebecca's sessions are on Wednesday and Thursday (since they must lead sessions that meet on the same day and there is only one day left for each of them).
    - Lan's session is on Friday morning (since Olivia's session is on Friday and Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day).
    Therefore, we can determine the sessions for all of the lab assistants except for Lan.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach:
  We know that Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session. We can use this information to determine which lab assistants must lead the remaining sessions. We can then use the constraints to determine which sessions the remaining lab assistants lead.

Solution:
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we know that Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session (since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's). We also know that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Wednesday afternoon session. This means that Kevin and Rebecca must lead the remaining morning sessions (since they must lead sessions that meet on the same day). Finally, Lan cannot lead the Thursday morning session (since Olivia leads the Thursday afternoon session), so Lan must lead the Wednesday morning session. This leaves only one session remaining—the Friday morning session—which must be led by the remaining lab assistant, which is Rebecca. Therefore, we can determine which sessions five of the lab assistants lead, so the answer is E: five. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach:
  1. If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday.
  2. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so Nessa's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on Wednesday or Thursday.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan's session must be on Wednesday or Friday.
  5. Therefore, the only unknown sessions are the Wednesday morning session and the Friday morning session.
  6. Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on Wednesday or Thursday, so they cannot lead the Friday morning session.
  7. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Wednesday morning session.
  8. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Olivia cannot lead the Wednesday morning session.
  9. Therefore, the only lab assistant who can lead the Wednesday morning session is Julio, and the only lab assistant who can lead the Friday morning session is Lan.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the following:
  1. Julio's session is on Thursday afternoon.
  2. Olivia's session is on Friday (because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's).
  3. Lan's session is on Wednesday (because Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day).
  4. Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon (because Nessa must lead an afternoon session).
  5. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Since Kevin cannot lead the Friday afternoon session (because Nessa is leading that session), Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday sessions.
  
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions for all of the lab assistants except for one. The lab assistant whose session we cannot determine is the one who has not been mentioned yet. Therefore, the answer is:

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina
  C: Irving and Robert
  D: Kyle and Nina
  E: Olivia and Kyle
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a table to keep track of which students can give reports on which days and in which time slots. 

| Day       | Morning   | Afternoon |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Monday    | Kyle      | Lenore    |
| Monday    | Irving    | Helen     |
| Tuesday   | George    | Nina      |
| Tuesday   | Olivia    | Robert    |
| Wednesday | Nina      |           |
| Wednesday | Helen/Irving | Kyle/Olivia |

If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. 

Answer: 
  B: Helen and Nina. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen must give a report on Wednesday.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a table to keep track of which students can give reports on which days and in which time slots:

| Day       | Morning   | Afternoon |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Monday    |           |           |
| Tuesday   | George    |           |
| Wednesday |           |           |

We can use the given conditions to fill in the table:
- Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he must give his report on Tuesday morning.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give their reports on Monday morning and Wednesday morning, respectively.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. So, if Nina gives a report on Monday morning, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday morning. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday morning, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday morning. If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving can give their reports on any day.

| Day       | Morning   | Afternoon |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Monday    | Nina      | Olivia    |
| Tuesday   | George    | Robert    |
| Wednesday | Helen     | Irving    |

Now, we can check each pair of students to see if they must give reports on Wednesday:
- A: George and Lenore: George must give his report on Tuesday, so Lenore cannot give her report on the same day as George. Lenore can give her report on Monday or Wednesday. Therefore, this pair does not have to give reports on Wednesday.
- B: Helen and Nina: If Nina gives her report on Monday morning, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday morning. Therefore, Helen and Nina must give their reports on Wednesday. This is the correct answer.
- C: Irving and Robert: Robert must give his report on Tuesday, so Irving cannot give his report on the same day as Robert. Irving can give his report on Monday or Wednesday. Therefore, this pair does not have to give reports on Wednesday.
- D: Kyle and Nina: If Nina gives her report on Monday morning, then Kyle can give his report on Tuesday morning or Wednesday morning. If Nina gives her report on Tuesday morning, then Kyle must give his report on Wednesday morning. Therefore, this pair does not have to give reports on Wednesday.
- E: Olivia and Kyle: Olivia must give her report on Monday morning, so Kyle cannot give his report on the same day as Olivia. Kyle can give his report on Tuesday morning or Wednesday morning. Therefore, this pair does not have to give reports on Wednesday.

|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Monday    | Kyle      | Lenore    |
| Monday    | Helen     | Irving    |
| Tuesday   | George    | Nina      |
| Tuesday   | Olivia    | Robert    |
| Wednesday | Nina      |           |
| Wednesday | Helen/Irving |         |

We can see that if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.

So, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  4. So, the possible pairs of students who can give reports on Wednesday are (George, Kyle), (George, Lenore), (Helen, Irving), (Helen, Robert), (Irving, Robert), and (Kyle, Nina).
  5. But, George can only give a report on Tuesday. So, the possible pairs of students who can give reports on Wednesday are (Helen, Irving), (Helen, Robert), and (Irving, Robert).
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a table to keep track of which students can give reports on which days and in which time slots:

| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Monday      | ? | ? |
| Tuesday      | George | ? |
| Wednesday | ? | ? |

From the given information, we know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so we can fill that in the table. Also, Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so we can eliminate them from the afternoon slots. 

| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Monday      | ? | ? |
| Tuesday      | George | ? |
| Wednesday | ? | Irving/Helen/Nina |

If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. If Nina does not give a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. 

| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Monday      | ? | ? |
| Tuesday      | George | ? |
| Wednesday | ? | Helen/Irving/Nina |

Now, we need to figure out which students can give reports on Monday. Since exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days, and we already have three students assigned to Tuesday and Wednesday, we know that the remaining three students must give reports on Monday. 

| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Monday      | Kyle | Olivia/Lenore |
| Tuesday      | George | Robert/Kyle |
| Wednesday | Nina | Helen/Irving |

Therefore, the only pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other is Helen and Nina. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 1, George must give his report on Tuesday. 
  From condition 2, Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Therefore, they must give their reports in the morning.
  From condition 3, if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give her report on Tuesday, otherwise, Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday, which is not possible since there are only two reports on Wednesday.
  Therefore, Nina must give her report on Monday or Wednesday.
  From condition 4, exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Therefore, there will be one morning report and one afternoon report on each day.
  From condition 5, exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Therefore, exactly two students will not give reports.
  
  If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday, and George must give his report on Wednesday. Therefore, Lenore, Kyle, and Olivia must give their reports on Monday. Robert cannot give his report on Tuesday since he cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, Robert must give his report on Wednesday. This means that George and Nina must give their reports on Tuesday. This arrangement satisfies all the conditions, but it does not answer the question.
  
  If Nina gives her report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give their reports together. Therefore, Helen and Irving can give their reports on Monday and Tuesday in any order. George must give his report on Tuesday, and Nina cannot give her report on Tuesday. Therefore, Lenore, Kyle, and Olivia must give their reports on Monday. Robert cannot give his report on Wednesday since he cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, Robert must give his report on Monday or Tuesday. This means that George and Nina must give their reports on Wednesday. This arrangement satisfies all the conditions, and the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are George and Nina.

  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But George can only give a report on Tuesday, so Nina cannot give a report on Monday. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the same day. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Monday. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday. If Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, then George cannot give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, George must give a report on Tuesday. If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Olivia and Robert cannot give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Olivia and Robert must give reports on Monday and Wednesday. If Olivia and Robert give reports on Monday and Wednesday, then Kyle and Lenore must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, the only pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are Helen and Nina.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that George must give his report on Tuesday. 
  From condition 2, we know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. 
  From condition 3, we know that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
  Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. 
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. 
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports. 
  From condition 4, we know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. 
  From condition 5, we know that exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. 
  Therefore, we can conclude that the two remaining students who have not been mentioned in the conditions will give their reports on Monday and Wednesday. 
  We can eliminate options A, C, D, and E because none of them include Nina, Helen, and Irving. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: Helen and Nina.

  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 1 or space 3.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 3.
  - Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 4 or space 5.
  - The shoe store is in space 2, so the toy store cannot be in space 1 or space 3.
  - The only option that satisfies all of the constraints is that the optometrist is in space 5.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 2.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy cannot be in space 2.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 1 or space 3.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurants cannot be in spaces 1, 2, 3, or 6.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the veterinarian cannot be in space 3, the optometrist must be in space 3. Therefore, the toy store cannot be in space 4, and it must be in space 5 or space 6. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, and they cannot be in spaces 1, 2, 3, or 6, one of the restaurants must be in space 7. Therefore, the other restaurant must be in space 4, and the veterinarian must be in space 5. Thus, the optometrist is in space 3, which means that A is a possible arrangement.

  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures must be: [?, ?, watercolors, ?]
  
Analysis:
  - Since the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures must be: [?, ?, watercolors, ?]
  - From the given constraints, we know that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be the first one.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden's lecture cannot be the fourth one.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be the last one.
  - Based on the above analysis, we can eliminate choices A, D, and E.

  A: Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture, which is third.
  B: The oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture, so if Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then the order of the lectures must be: [Farley, Holden, Garcia, watercolors], and Jiang must give the lithographs lecture, which contradicts the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so if Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the order of the lectures must be: [Farley, Holden, watercolors, Garcia], and Jiang must give the lithographs lecture, which satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, Garcia could give the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so Holden cannot give the sculptures lecture, which is later than the watercolors lecture.
  E: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture, so if Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the order of the lectures must be: [Farley, Holden, watercolors, Jiang], and Garcia must give the sculptures lecture, which contradicts the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture.

Analysis:
  - Since the watercolors lecture is third, the order of the lectures must be: [?, ?, watercolors, ?].
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so Holden must give the first lecture and Garcia and Jiang must give the last two lectures in some order.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture, so the lithographs lecture must be last.
  - Therefore, the order of the lectures must be: [Holden, Farley, watercolors, Garcia/Jiang, lithographs].
  
Action: 
  - Option A is not possible because Farley must give the first or second lecture, not the third.
  - Option B is not possible because the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture, and the lithographs lecture must be last.
  - Option C is possible because Garcia can give the sculptures lecture, which must be the fourth lecture.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F, G, K, L, or M must be the other two selected scientists.
  
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which contradicts the condition that at least one zoologist must be selected. Therefore, F cannot be selected.
  
  If G is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which contradicts the condition that at least one zoologist must be selected. Therefore, G cannot be selected.
  
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected.
  
  If L is selected, then either M or K must be selected to satisfy the condition that at least one chemist must be selected. However, if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected, which contradicts the condition that P is the only zoologist selected. Therefore, M cannot be selected, and K must be selected. If K is selected, then G cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, B is true.
  
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected, which contradicts the condition that P is the only zoologist selected. Therefore, M cannot be selected.
  
  If exactly one chemist is selected, then it must be either K or L to satisfy the condition that at least one chemist must be selected. Therefore, C is false.
  
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then neither F nor G can be selected because F and K cannot both be selected and K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, D and E are true.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and either K, L, or M must be selected as a chemist.
  
  Let's evaluate each option:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. There is no direct relationship between K and G. This option is not true.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. There is no direct relationship between L and F. This option is not true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. This is not true, as either K, L, or M can be selected as a chemist.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. This is not true, as F can be selected as a botanist even if two chemists are selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. This is true, as if G is selected as a botanist, then at most one zoologist can be selected, and P is the only zoologist available. Therefore, G cannot be selected if exactly two chemists are selected.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R are not selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, and G is selected, then we have two botanists and no zoologists. This violates the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Therefore, A is false.
  B: If L is selected, then K and M cannot be selected. Therefore, F must be selected to satisfy the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Therefore, B is false.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, then it must be either L or M. However, if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected, which violates the condition that P is the only zoologist selected. Therefore, C is false.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then they must be any two of the three chemists except K and M. Therefore, F can still be selected to satisfy the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Therefore, D is false.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then they must be any two of the three chemists except K and M. Therefore, G can still be selected to satisfy the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Therefore, E is false.

  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, then M cannot be selected, but there is no restriction on selecting G. This statement is not necessarily true.
  B: If L is selected, then K and M cannot be selected. There is no restriction on selecting F. This statement is not necessarily true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, then it must be K. This statement is true because if L or M is selected, then K cannot be selected. If two or three chemists are selected, then K can be selected with one of the other two chemists.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then F cannot be selected. This statement is not necessarily true because F can be selected with one botanist and one chemist, or with two botanists and one zoologist.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then G cannot be selected. This statement is true because if G is selected, then at least two botanists are selected, which means at most one zoologist can be selected. But since P is the only zoologist selected, this is a contradiction.

  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: 
If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected. If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which means P cannot be selected. Therefore, G must be selected. If L is selected, then F cannot be selected because F is a botanist and if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Therefore, B must be true. None of the other choices are necessarily true based on the given conditions.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and either K or L must be selected as a chemist. M cannot be selected because if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, which would violate the condition that P is the only zoologist selected.

Analysis:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. - There is no direct relationship between K and G. This statement is not necessarily true.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. - There is no direct relationship between L and F. This statement is not necessarily true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. - This statement is not necessarily true. Either K or L can be selected as the only chemist.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. - This statement is true. If F is selected, then either K or L must be selected as the other chemist. But if K is selected, G cannot be selected, and if L is selected, F cannot be selected. Therefore, if exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. - This statement is not necessarily true. If K and L are selected as the two chemists, then G can be selected as a botanist.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, then M cannot be selected. But there is no restriction on selecting G if K is selected. So, this statement is not necessarily true.
  B: If L is selected, then K and M cannot be selected. But there is no restriction on selecting F if L is selected. So, this statement is not necessarily true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it can be either K, L, or M. So, this statement is not necessarily true.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, they can be any two from K, L, and M. So, this statement is not necessarily true.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, they can be any two from K, L, and M. So, this statement is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
- If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- F and K cannot both be selected.
- K and M cannot both be selected.
- If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Action: Answer("B")

If L is selected, then at most one botanist can be selected. This means that F, G, and H are not all selected. If F is not selected, then K can be selected. If K is selected, then F cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, if L is selected, F cannot be selected. Hence, choice B is the correct answer.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist. If G is selected, then K cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected. If K is not selected, then A is not necessarily true. If L is selected, then M must be selected because K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected, so E is not necessarily true. If exactly one chemist is selected, it could be either K, L, or M, so C is not necessarily true. If exactly two chemists are selected, then they could be any two of K, L, and M, so D and E are not necessarily true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a sales representative who cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra also works in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 2. This means that Udall and Stuckey work in Zone 3, and Kim and Mahr work in Zone 2. In this case, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao. So, eliminate choice D.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then Tiao also works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 3. This means that Parra works in Zone 1, and Stuckey, Kim, and Mahr work in Zone 3. In this case, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall. So, eliminate choice E.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then Stuckey and Udall also work in Zone 3. This means that Parra works in Zone 1, and Kim, Mahr, and Tiao work in Zone 2. In this case, Quinn can work in the same sales zone as all other sales representatives. So, eliminate choices A, B, and C.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, then there would be 2 sales representatives in that zone, and the remaining 5 sales representatives would be split between the other 2 zones. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, this would mean that there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3. However, since there are only 5 sales representatives left to split between Zone 2 and Zone 3, this would mean that there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, which contradicts the fact that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:

  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
To determine the answer, we need to find the sales representative who cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, we can deduce that Tiao cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn. Therefore, the answer is D: Tiao.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, then Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and there are at most 2 sales representatives in that sales zone. This contradicts the fact that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra. 
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Tiao, then either Parra or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 1, and the other one works in Zone 2. This means that there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the fact that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Udall, then Stuckey also works in that sales zone, and there are at most 3 sales representatives in that sales zone. This means that there are at most 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the fact that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Kim, Mahr, or Stuckey, then there are at most 2 sales representatives in that sales zone, which contradicts the fact that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Kim, Mahr, or Stuckey.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are 3 sales zones and 7 sales representatives.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
To determine the answer, we need to find the sales representatives that cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn. We know that Quinn and Parra work in the same sales zone, so they cannot be the answer. We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, so they cannot be the answer either. That leaves us with Kim, Mahr, and Tiao. 

Action: Answer("D")  
The sales representative that Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as is Tiao.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Kim, then Mahr and Stuckey must work in Zone 2 and Parra and Tiao must work in Zone 3. This would mean that Udall would not have a sales zone to work in, which is not possible. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Kim.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, then Quinn cannot work in Zone 1. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then Quinn must work in Zone 3. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, who works in the same sales zone as Udall. Thus, the answer is C: Stuckey.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, they cannot both work in Zone 1 or Zone 2. Therefore, one of them must work in Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3, leaving only Kim, Mahr, Parra (or Tiao), and Quinn to work in Zone 1 and Zone 2. Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, it follows that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, who must work in Zone 3. Therefore, the answer is C: Stuckey.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, then there would be at most 2 sales representatives in that zone, which would mean that there would be at most 2 sales representatives in the other two zones combined. However, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, this is not possible. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  
  A: Kim is not mentioned in relation to Quinn, so it is possible for Quinn to work in the same sales zone as Kim.
  B: Mahr is not mentioned in relation to Quinn, so it is possible for Quinn to work in the same sales zone as Mahr.
  C: Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so it is possible for Quinn to work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  D: Tiao is mentioned in relation to Quinn, so it is not possible for Quinn to work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  E: Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so it is possible for Quinn to work in the same sales zone as Udall.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are 3 sales zones and 7 sales representatives.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

To determine the answer, we need to find the sales representative who cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, we know that Quinn cannot work in Zone 1. We also know that either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, so Quinn cannot work in Zone 2 if Tiao is the one working there. Therefore, the answer is B: Mahr.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), Villas, White, and (unknown). 
  
  Stanton cannot be recruited immediately before or after Tao, which means that Stanton cannot be recruited in the first or third position.
  
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be: Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), Villas, White, Stanton or Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), White, Villas, Stanton.
  
  Therefore, Stanton could have been recruited either third or fifth.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be: Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, Stanton.
  
  Stanton cannot have been recruited first because Tao was not immediately before or after Stanton.
  Stanton cannot have been recruited second because Peters was recruited fourth.
  Stanton cannot have been recruited third because Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, Stanton CANNOT have been recruited fifth or seventh.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), Villas, White or Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), White, Villas.
  Stanton cannot have been recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), Villas, White or Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), White, Villas.
  In either case, Stanton cannot have been recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, the statement is true.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Quinn, Rovero, and the remaining accomplices would be recruited in some order.
  
  There are two possible positions for Stanton in the order of recruitment: either Stanton was recruited before Quinn and Rovero or Stanton was recruited after Quinn and Rovero.
  
  If Stanton was recruited before Quinn and Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, and the remaining accomplices would be recruited in some order. In this case, Stanton could have been recruited first, second, or third, but not fifth or seventh.
  
  If Stanton was recruited after Quinn and Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, and the remaining accomplices would be recruited in some order. In this case, Stanton could have been recruited fifth or seventh, but not first, second, or third.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited first.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be: Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited third.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Quinn, Rovero, and the remaining four accomplices would be recruited in some order.
  This means that Stanton could not have been recruited first, second, or third, because he was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, and Peters, Quinn, and Rovero were already recruited.
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order would be Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, Stanton, and the remaining two accomplices would be recruited in some order.
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order would be Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, Tao, Stanton.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices would be: Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited either third, fifth, or seventh.
  
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of the accomplices would be: Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White. This is a valid order.
  
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of the accomplices would be: Peters, Tao, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Villas, White. This is also a valid order.
  
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order of the accomplices would be: Peters, Tao, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, Stanton. This is also a valid order.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above") 
Since Stanton could have been recruited third, fifth, or seventh, the answer is "none of the above".

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then we can infer that the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after the percussionist does. 

Analysis:
  - The percussionist cannot perform the last solo since the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform the fifth or the sixth solo.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time before the guitarist does, so the keyboard player must perform the first, second, or third solo.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Since the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, the saxophonist must perform after the trumpeter does.
  - The violinist must perform a solo before the keyboard player does.
  
  From the above analysis, we can conclude that the percussionist must perform the first solo, and the saxophonist must perform the sixth solo. Therefore, the answer is not A, B, D, or E. The only option left is C.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band, each performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the trumpeter does. Therefore, the percussionist performs a solo before the trumpeter does. Thus, D is true. None of the other options are necessarily true.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member of the band performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then:
  - The percussionist cannot perform the fifth solo, because the saxophonist must perform after either the percussionist or the trumpeter.
  - The percussionist must perform either the first or the second solo, because the saxophonist cannot perform before the percussionist.
  
  A: The percussionist cannot perform the first solo, because the saxophonist must perform after either the percussionist or the trumpeter.
  B: The percussionist can perform the second solo, and the saxophonist can perform the fifth solo. This satisfies all the given restrictions.
  C: The violinist must perform before the keyboard player, but there is no information about the saxophonist performing after the violinist.
  D: There is no information about the percussionist performing before the trumpeter.
  E: There is no information about the saxophonist performing before the keyboard player.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does. Therefore, the possible order of solos is:
  
  P - S - (K or V) - V or K - G - T
  
  where P is the percussionist, S is the saxophonist, K is the keyboard player, V is the violinist, G is the guitarist, and T is the trumpeter.
  
  Now, we can eliminate some options:
  A: The percussionist cannot perform the first solo because the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does.
  B: The percussionist can perform the second solo, but it is not a must.
  C: The order of solos of the violinist and the saxophonist is not determined.
  D: The percussionist can perform a solo before the trumpeter does, but it is not a must.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
  The saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does, and the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does:
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after the percussionist does.
  - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player does.
  
  A: It is not necessarily true.
  B: It is not necessarily true.
  C: It is not necessarily true.
  D: It is necessarily true.
  E: It is not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member of the band performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  - We are given that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  
Analysis:
  - If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform either the fifth or the sixth solo.
  - The percussionist cannot perform the first solo because the saxophonist would have to perform after the percussionist, which is not possible.
  - The percussionist could perform the second solo, but we cannot determine this for sure.
  - The violinist must perform before the keyboard player, so we cannot determine whether the violinist performs before or after the saxophonist.
  - The percussionist performing before the trumpeter is not necessarily true.
  - The saxophonist performing before the keyboard player is not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then it means that the saxophonist will perform a solo at some time after the percussionist does.
  
Analysis:
  - The percussionist cannot perform the last solo because the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. This means that the keyboard player cannot perform the first solo, and the violinist cannot perform the last solo.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, then the saxophonist cannot perform after the trumpeter.
  
Solution:
  - The percussionist cannot perform the first solo because the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does.
  - The percussionist cannot perform the second solo because the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. This means that the keyboard player must perform the second solo, and the violinist must perform the first solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does. This means that the percussionist must perform the third solo, and the saxophonist must perform the fourth solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform the first solo.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, then the saxophonist cannot perform after the trumpeter. Therefore, the answer is not D or E.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band and each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then there are two possibilities:
1. The percussionist performs a solo before the trumpeter does, and the saxophonist performs a solo after the trumpeter does.
2. The trumpeter performs a solo before the percussionist does, and the saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist does.

However, we know that the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform a solo before the keyboard player does. This means that the first possibility is not valid, and the second possibility must be true. So the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does. Hence, the correct answer is D.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does.
  
  A: It is not possible to determine if the percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, then the percussionist cannot perform the second solo, because the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does. Therefore, this statement is false.
  C: If the keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does, and the saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist does, then it is possible that the violinist performs a solo before the saxophonist does. Therefore, this statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true.
  D: If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, then it is possible that the percussionist performs a solo before the trumpeter does. Therefore, this statement could be true, but it is not necessarily true.
  E: If the saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist does, then it is not possible for the saxophonist to perform a solo before the keyboard player does. Therefore, this statement is false.
  
  The only statement that must be true is C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the trumpeter does. This is because the saxophonist cannot perform a solo after both the percussionist and the trumpeter. Therefore, the percussionist must perform a solo before the trumpeter does. 

  A: It is not necessarily true that the percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: It is not necessarily true that the percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: It is not necessarily true that the violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: This must be true because the percussionist performs a solo before the trumpeter does.
  E: It is not necessarily true that the saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.

The lectures must be given in either Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium, in an order that meets the following conditions: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Analysis:
  If the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, then the second lecture must also be in Gladwyn Hall.
  If the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, then the fifth lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers, so the lecture on oystercatchers must be in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall, so the lecture on terns must be in Gladwyn Hall and the lecture on petrels must be in Howard Auditorium.

Action: Answer("C") - The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Also, the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, we can deduce that the second lecture must be on either petrels or rails, and the fifth lecture must be on either oystercatchers or rails. 

A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. This is possible, as the second lecture could be on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily false.
B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. This is not possible, as the second lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, this statement must be false.
C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. This is not possible, as the fifth lecture must be on either oystercatchers or rails, which are both in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, this statement must be false.
D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. This is possible, as the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium and the third lecture could be on either petrels or rails, which are both in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily false.
E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. This is not possible, as the fifth lecture must be on either oystercatchers or rails, which are both in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, this statement must be false.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
Analysis:
  Since the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, the second lecture must also be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, option C is false. 
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers, so the lecture on oystercatchers must be the fifth lecture. Therefore, the lecture on petrels must be the third lecture and it is in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, option B is also false.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so the lecture on rails must be the second lecture and it is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the lecture on terns must be the first lecture and it is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the lecture on sandpipers must be the fourth lecture. Therefore, option A, D, and E are all true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  - Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.

  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Also, the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, we can deduce that the second lecture must be on petrels and it must be in Gladwyn Hall. This means that the third lecture must be on rails and it must be in Howard Auditorium. Also, the fifth lecture must be on oystercatchers and it must be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, we can conclude that the false statement must violate one of these conditions.

Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning: 
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor. 
  Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, then the other painting on wall 2 must be an oil painting.
  Therefore, the only possible options are Franz's oil and Greene's oil, since Hidalgo's oil is already on wall 2 and Isaacs's oil is on wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's watercolor because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Also, no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, the other painting on wall 2 must be either Franz's oil or Greene's watercolor. However, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so if Franz's oil is on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 2. Therefore, the other painting on wall 2 must be Franz's oil.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  7. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we know that the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor. This means that neither Hidalgo's watercolor nor Isaacs's watercolor can be on wall 2, since each wall has exactly one oil and one watercolor. We also know that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so Franz's oil cannot be on wall 2. However, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so if Franz's oil is not on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 either. This leaves us with only one option: Greene's oil. Since each wall has exactly one oil and one watercolor, and we know that Hidalgo's oil is on wall 2, the only other painting that could be on wall 2 is Greene's oil.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's watercolor. Also, since no wall can have only watercolors, the other painting on wall 2 must be an oil painting. Since no wall can have only the work of one student, the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's other painting. Also, since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs, the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Franz's oil or Isaacs's oil. Therefore, the only possible painting that could be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor, in the upper and lower positions.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning: 
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor. 
  Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, the other painting on wall 2 must be an oil painting.
  Since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, the other oil painting on wall 2 cannot be painted by Hidalgo.
  Since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, the other oil painting on wall 2 cannot be painted by Franz or Isaacs.
  According to condition 5, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Franz's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 3.
  According to condition 6, Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 3.
  Since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, neither Franz's watercolor nor Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on wall 2.
  
Action: Answer("C") - Greene's oil.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then:
  1. Wall 2 has Hidalgo's oil.
  2. Wall 2 cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor.
  3. Wall 2 cannot have both paintings by Hidalgo.
  4. Wall 2 cannot have both paintings by Franz or Isaacs.
  5. Wall 1 cannot have only watercolors.
  6. Wall 3 cannot have only watercolors.
  
  Therefore, the only possible painting that could be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's watercolor, which must be in the lower position.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning: 
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, it means that the other painting on wall 2 must be an oil painting. Therefore, the only possible options are Franz's oil and Greene's oil since Hidalgo's oil is already on wall 2 and Isaacs's oil is on wall 4. However, if Franz's oil is on wall 2, then Isaacs's watercolor must be on wall 1, which would violate condition 4. Therefore, the only possible option is Greene's oil.

  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning: 
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's watercolor, because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Also, since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, the other painting on wall 2 cannot be painted by Hidalgo. Therefore, the other painting on wall 2 must be painted by either Franz, Greene, or Isaacs. According to condition 4, it cannot be painted by Isaacs. According to condition 5, if Franz's oil is displayed on wall 1, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 1, which is not possible because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, Franz's oil must be displayed on wall 3, and Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 3. According to condition 4, no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 3. Therefore, the only possible painting that could also be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor on wall 2 because no wall can have only one student's work displayed on it. Therefore, we can eliminate option D. 
  We also know that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, we can eliminate option A and E.
  We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then we can have Greene's oil displayed on wall 2. We cannot have Greene's watercolor on wall 2 because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, the answer is C.
  
Action: Answer("C")

  - Wall 2 cannot have both paintings by Hidalgo because no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - Wall 2 cannot have both paintings by Franz and Isaacs because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Wall 2 cannot have Isaacs's oil painting because Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Wall 2 cannot have Greene's watercolor painting because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  
Action: Answer("C")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then which one of the following could be true of this evening's schedule?
Choices:
  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The theater has three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must begin before the sci-fi film. Since the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, it must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2. Therefore, the western must also be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2. This means that the horror film and the mystery must be shown on the remaining screen. Since the romance is not shown on screen 2, it must be shown on screen 1 if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2, or on screen 2 if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1.

A: The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 because the romance is not shown on screen 2.
B: The mystery cannot begin at 9 P.M. because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
C: The romance can be shown on screen 1 if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2, or on screen 2 if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1. Therefore, this could be true.
D: The sci-fi film cannot begin at 7 P.M. because screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
E: The western can begin at 8 P.M. if it is shown on screen 3, but it cannot begin at 8 P.M. if it is shown on screen 1 or screen 2.

Action: Answer("C")

  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only possible screens are 1 and 2. The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 because the romance is not shown on screen 2. Therefore, the horror film must be shown on screen 1. The mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the mystery must be shown on screen 2. The western must begin before the horror film, so it cannot begin at 8 P.M. Therefore, the western must begin at 7 P.M. or 9 P.M. If the western begins at 7 P.M., then the sci-fi film must begin at 9 P.M. and be shown on screen 2. If the western begins at 9 P.M., then the sci-fi film must begin at 7 P.M. and be shown on screen 1. The only option that is consistent with these conditions is D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.

  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only possible screens are 1 and 2. Therefore, the horror film and the mystery must be shown on the other screen. The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 3. The sci-fi film cannot begin at 7 P.M., so it must begin at 9 P.M. Therefore:
  - The western begins at 7 P.M. or 9 P.M.
  - The sci-fi film begins at 9 P.M.
  - The horror film is shown on the other screen.
  - The mystery begins at 7 P.M. or 9 P.M.

Analysis:
  - If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on different screens.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  - The western begins before the horror film, so it must be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1 or screen 2.
  - If the western is shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1, then the sci-fi film must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1, and the horror film must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2. The mystery would be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 2, and the romance would be shown at 8 P.M. on screen 3. Therefore, none of the choices are true.
  - If the western is shown at 7 P.M. on screen 2, then the sci-fi film must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2, and the horror film must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1. The mystery would be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 3, and the romance would be shown at 8 P.M. on screen 1. Therefore, choice B could be true.

Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  We are looking for a list of bands that could perform in slot one.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  
Analysis:
  Slot one is one of the first three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  So, Yardsign could perform in slot one.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  So, if Vegemite performs in slot one, Zircon cannot perform in slot one.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  So, if Wellspring performs in slot one, Zircon cannot perform in slot one.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  So, Uneasy cannot perform in slot one.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf. This means that M and F must be on the middle shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, they must be the only two books on the middle shelf. Therefore, G and I must be on the top shelf, and K and O must be on the bottom shelf. This means that H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. Therefore, the answer is (C) H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and K must be on the middle shelf. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, F must be on the bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, M must also be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, G and H must be on the middle shelf together. The only option that is true is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. Answer("C").
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then:
  - H cannot be on the top shelf because that would mean L is on the top shelf, which is not possible.
  - H cannot be on the same shelf as L because that would mean L is not on a higher shelf than H.
  - Therefore, H must be on the middle shelf and L must be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, and there are only 2 books left (G and O), then G and O must be on the top shelf together.
  - I is on the middle shelf, so K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the bottom shelf.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf, so O must be on the top shelf. Therefore, K must be on the middle shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, then F and M must be on the bottom shelf. Finally, G and H must be on the middle shelf. Therefore, the only option that must be true is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K and M must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, then O must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, G and H must be on the same shelf as each other, because they are the only two books left and they cannot be on the top shelf.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the top or middle shelf.
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, and there are only 3 shelves, F and M must be on the same shelf as I.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F, so K and F cannot be on the same shelf as I.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L, so O and L cannot be on the same shelf as I.
  - Therefore, the only two books that can be on the same shelf as H are G and O.
  - K must be on the same shelf as I and M, which means K cannot be on the same shelf as H or L.
  - Therefore, the only option that must be true is that K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf if L is on the middle shelf. But this contradicts the fact that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, L must be on the bottom shelf. This means that H must be on the middle shelf, and since I is already on the middle shelf, H and I must be on the same shelf. Therefore, the answer is (D) I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are on each shelf.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and there are only three shelves, F and M must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on the top shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, G and H must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, the only option that must be true is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the top or middle shelf.
  - If L is on the top shelf, then O must also be on the top shelf, which violates the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, L must be on the middle shelf.
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, then K must be on the top shelf and M must be on the middle shelf.
  - Therefore, G and H must be on the bottom shelf, and I must be on the middle shelf.
  - This means that the only option that must be true is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  
Action: Answer("C")

  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and there are only two books left (G and H), G and H must be on the bottom shelf.

If G and H are both selected, then F cannot be selected because there can be at most one botanist if more than one botanist is selected. If F is not selected, then K must be selected to fulfill the requirement of having at least one chemist. If K is selected, then M cannot be selected because K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, the answer is A or K must be selected if F is not selected.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and one zoologist.
  If F is not selected, then K must be selected.
  If M is not selected, then F must be selected.
  If K is not selected, then M must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and one zoologist. This means that either F, G, or H must be selected as a botanist and either P, Q, or R must be selected as a zoologist.
  If F is not selected, then K must be selected. This means that either F or K must be selected.
  If M is not selected, then F must be selected. This means that either F or M must be selected.
  If K is not selected, then M must be selected. This means that either K or M must be selected.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. If F is not selected, then either K or M must be selected. If K is selected, then M cannot be selected. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either F or else K.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then the panel will have two botanists, which means at most one zoologist can be selected. This violates the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If K is not selected, then the panel will have two chemists, which means at most one botanist can be selected. This violates the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If M is not selected, then the panel can have at most one chemist, which violates the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or K, but not both, and must include M if P and R are both selected.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then K must be selected to satisfy the condition of having at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If F is selected, then either K or M must be selected to satisfy the condition of having at least one chemist and one zoologist.
  However, K and M cannot both be selected, so if F is selected, then only one of K or M can be selected.
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or else K if both G and H are among the scientists selected.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then K must be selected to satisfy the condition that at least one botanist is selected.
  If M is not selected, then either P or R must be selected to satisfy the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If both F and M are not selected, then K and either P or R must be selected to satisfy the conditions.
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or K.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Solution:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then the panel must include K or M to satisfy the condition that at least one botanist and one chemist are selected. 
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected. Therefore, the panel must include K and not F. 
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. Therefore, the panel must include M, P, and R. 
  So, the panel must include either K or M. 
  Therefore, the answer is A or B.

  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then it means that the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on the same day as the third batch of another kind of cookie. Let's consider the possible cases:
  - If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, so B is true. Also, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so C is false. At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days, so A is true. Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, so D is true. Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday, so E is true. Therefore, the answer is C. 
  - If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of peanut butter cookies, then the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, so B is true. At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days, so A is true. Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so C is false. Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, so D is true. Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday, so E is true. Therefore, the answer is C.
  - If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, so B is true. At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days, so A is true. Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so C is false. Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, so D is true. Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday, so E is true. Therefore, the answer is C.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 3:

  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

To answer this question, we need to consider the possible days for each batch of cookies and see which option is affected by the condition given in the question.

If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then:
- The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
- The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday or Friday.
- The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
- The third batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday or Friday.

    - The third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  - We need to find the statement that could be false based on this deduction.

Solution:
  - If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday, then the earliest the third batch of another kind of cookie can be made is Wednesday. Therefore, statement C is true.
  - If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Tuesday, then the earliest the third batch of another kind of cookie can be made is Thursday. Therefore, statement D is true.
  - If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday, then the latest the third batch of another kind of cookie can be made is Friday. Therefore, statement E is true.
  - If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Tuesday, then the latest the third batch of another kind of cookie can be made is Friday. Therefore, statement A is true.
  - The only statement that could be false is B, because it is possible that only one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday (e.g. the third batch of oatmeal cookies).

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
To answer this question, we need to consider the possible combinations of batches that could be made on the same day. If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then it must be the first batch of oatmeal cookies and the third batch of sugar cookies that are made on the same day. This means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday. This leaves only one possible arrangement for the remaining batches, as follows:
Monday: oatmeal #2, sugar #1, peanut butter #1
Tuesday: oatmeal #3, sugar #2, peanut butter #2
Wednesday: oatmeal #1, sugar #3, peanut butter #3
Thursday: oatmeal #2, sugar #2, peanut butter #1
Friday: oatmeal #1, sugar #1, peanut butter #3

Using this arrangement, we can determine which statement could be false:
A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (True)
B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (True)
C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (False - two batches are made on Monday)
D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (True)
E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. (False - two batches are made on Friday)

  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. This statement is true according to the given conditions.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. This statement is false because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, but we don't know if only one batch is made.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. This statement is true according to the given conditions.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. This statement is false because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Friday, but we don't know if only one batch is made.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?
Choices:
  A: Quinn
  B: Ruiz
  C: Verma
  D: Wells
  E: Xue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member.
  We need to determine which worker must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member because if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. This means that we need to select three project members from the remaining workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Verma, and Xue. Since Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the leader, and we need to select one leader from the three project members, we must select either Quinn or Ruiz as the leader. Therefore, we need to select two project members from the remaining workers: Smith, Verma, and Xue. Since Smith cannot be a project member if Taylor is not a project member, we must select either Verma or Xue as a project member.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members, and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" is not applicable.
  We need to find a worker who must be a project member regardless of whether Taylor is a project member or not.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, if Wells is not a project member, then either Ruiz or Verma must be a project member.
  However, Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, if neither Quinn nor Ruiz is the project leader, then neither of them can be a project member.
  This means that if Taylor is not a project member, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz, and the other one must be a project member. Additionally, we need one more project member.
  Therefore, the only worker who must be a project member in this case is Xue.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a member if they are the leader.
  If Smith is a member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
  If Taylor is not a member, then Smith cannot be a member either. 
  Wells can be a member, but neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, the project must include either Quinn or Ruiz as the leader and the third member.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" is not applicable.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint "If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be" is applicable.
  Since Taylor is not a project member, we need to select three members from the remaining six workers (excluding Taylor).
  If we select Wells, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. 
  Therefore, we cannot select Wells.
  If we select Quinn or Ruiz, then one of them must be the project leader. 
  Therefore, we cannot select Quinn or Ruiz.
  This leaves us with only two options: Smith and Xue.
  Therefore, we must select Smith and Xue as project members.
  Since we need to select a project leader, and Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, 
  we must select either Quinn or Ruiz as the project leader.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  We need to find which worker must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, the project must have at least one of Wells, Quinn or Ruiz as a project member. If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, Wells cannot be the project leader. Since exactly one of the project members must be the project leader, we can conclude that Wells cannot be a project member. Therefore, the project must have either Quinn or Ruiz as a project member and the project leader. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three workers, one of whom will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" is not applicable.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.
  Therefore, the constraint "If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be" is not applicable.
  We are left with five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Verma, and Xue.
  Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, and we know that exactly one of the three project members will be the project leader, we can conclude that either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or B.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, the constraint that Taylor must be a project member if Smith is a project member is not applicable. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, the only possible project members are Quinn, Smith, and Xue. Since one of the project members must be the leader, Quinn or Ruiz must be the leader. However, Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member. 
  Answer: Answer("A") Quinn.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member either because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, the project members can only be selected from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, the project leader must be selected from Quinn, Smith, or Xue. However, if Quinn or Ruiz is not a project member, they cannot be the project leader. Therefore, the project leader must be Smith or Xue. 
  
  Since exactly three workers will be selected to be project members, and Wells cannot be a project leader, the project members must be selected from the following four workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, and Xue. Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, and Smith cannot be a project member, the only possible combination of project members is Quinn, Verma, and Xue, with Quinn as the project leader.
  
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, Quinn must be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member either. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. 
  Therefore, the project must consist of Quinn or Ruiz as the leader, Wells as a member, and one other member.
  
  A: Quinn can only be a project member if he is the leader, so he cannot be a member in this scenario.
  B: Ruiz can only be a project member if he is the leader, so he cannot be a member in this scenario.
  C: Verma cannot be a project member if Wells is a project member, so she cannot be a member in this scenario.
  D: Wells must be a project member in this scenario.
  E: Xue is not mentioned in any of the constraints, so there is no reason to believe that she must be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  We need to determine which worker must be a project member.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, we can eliminate Smith from the list of potential project members. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, we can eliminate Wells from the list of potential project members. 
  This leaves us with five potential project members: Quinn, Ruiz, Taylor, Verma, and Xue. 
  Since Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project, and we know that exactly one of the project members will be the project leader, we can eliminate Quinn and Ruiz from the list of potential project members. 
  This leaves us with Taylor, Verma, and Xue as the only potential project members. 
  Since we need to determine which worker must be a project member, we can eliminate Xue from the list of potential project members because there is no information that suggests Xue must be a project member. 
  Therefore, the answer is Verma.

The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Veqemite performs in slot three, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than zircon

  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Process of elimination:
  - Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert: We don't know the position of Xpert, so we cannot determine if this statement is true or false. Eliminate A.
  - Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon: We know that Zircon performs after Vegemite, so it is not possible for Wellspring to perform before Zircon. Eliminate B.
  - Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy: We don't know the position of Xpert, so we cannot determine if this statement is true or false. Eliminate C.
  - Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring: We don't know the position of Wellspring, so we cannot determine if this statement is true or false. Eliminate D.
  - Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy: We know that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and Zircon performs after Vegemite. Therefore, it is not possible for Zircon to perform before Uneasy. Eliminate E.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The six slots at the benefit concert are numbered slot one through slot six.
  - The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Each band will perform in just one slot.
  - The order must meet the following constraints:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Veqemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Veqemite performs in slot three, Zircon must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  - Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Veqemite performs in slot three, Xpert must perform in slot six.
  - Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and Veqemite performs in slot three, Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  - Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, and Veqemite performs in slot three, Yardsign must perform in slot one or two.

  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  Since Vegemite performs in slot three, Yardsign cannot perform in slot one or two. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot three. This means that Uneasy cannot perform in slot six, so Uneasy must perform in slot four or five. Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Xpert cannot perform in slot one, Xpert must perform in slot two. This means that Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and four or five, but we don't know which one performs in which slot.

  B: We know that Zircon performs after Vegemite, and that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  C: We don't know where Uneasy and Xpert are performing, so we cannot determine if Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
  D: We know that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, but we don't know where Wellspring is performing, so we cannot determine if Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
  E: We know that Vegemite performs in slot three, and that Zircon performs after Vegemite, so Zircon cannot perform in an earlier slot than Uneasy. Therefore, Zircon performs in a later slot than Uneasy.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Process of elimination:
  - Option A: We don't know where Uneasy or Xpert will perform, so we cannot determine if Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert. Eliminate.
  - Option B: Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. If Vegemite is in slot three, then Wellspring must be in slot two and Zircon must be in slot one. Therefore, Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Keep.
  - Option C: We don't know where Uneasy or Xpert will perform, so we cannot determine if Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy. Eliminate.

  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or two.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or two. Therefore, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots four, five, or six. Since Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, Wellspring must perform in slot four and Zircon in slot five or six. Xpert must perform in slot six since both Wellspring and Zircon perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy must perform in slot four or five since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot one or two, and since Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, Wellspring must perform in slot one or two. Thus, the only option that must be true is that Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring. Therefore, the answer is D.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is not: [Quinn, Rovero, Villas, Peters, White, Stanton, Tao].
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is not: [Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White, Stanton, Tao].
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment could be: [Quinn, White, Villas, Rovero, Peters, Tao, Stanton] or [Quinn, White, Villas, Rovero, Tao, Peters, Stanton].
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is not Quinn, Villas, White, Peters, Rovero, Stanton, Tao.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is not Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton, Tao.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so the order of recruitment is not Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Stanton, Tao, Rovero.
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment could be Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, Stanton.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is not Quinn, Villas, Peters.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is not Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao.
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment must be: Quinn, Stanton, White, Villas, Rovero, Tao, Peters.
  - Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Tao was recruited sixth.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Peters was recruited fourth, we know that the order of recruitment is fixed.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White must be recruited either fifth or sixth.
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must be recruited last.
  - Since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, Stanton must be recruited either first, second, or seventh.
  - If Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero would have to be recruited fourth, which is not possible because Peters was recruited fourth.
  - If Rovero was recruited third, then Quinn would have to be recruited second, which is not possible because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - If Stanton was recruited second, then Quinn would have to be recruited first, which is possible.
  - If Tao was recruited sixth, then Villas would have to be recruited fifth, which is not possible because Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - If Villas was recruited sixth, then Tao would have to be recruited seventh, which is possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:

Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  - We know that White was recruited before Rovero and Rovero was recruited before Tao.
  - Therefore, Tao must be recruited either 6th or 7th.
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so Tao cannot be recruited earlier than 6th.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited later than 2nd.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas cannot be recruited later than 7th.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited 2nd or 6th.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If Rovero was recruited third, then the order of recruitment could be Quinn, Villas, Rovero, Peters, White, Stanton, Tao.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of these three must be White, Rovero, Tao.
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the first three must be Quinn, Stanton, Villas (in some order).
  - Therefore, the order of the seven accomplices must be: Quinn, Stanton, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, Peters.
  - From this order, we can see that (B) Rovero was recruited third could be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of the three must be White, Rovero, Tao.
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the first three must be Quinn, Stanton, Villas (in some order).
  - Therefore, Tao must be recruited fifth or later.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The only option that is consistent with the given information is that Tao was recruited sixth.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The order of the accomplices' recruitment is Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of the accomplices' recruitment is as follows: Peters, Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton, Tao.
  A: Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth, so Rovero cannot be recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth, so Stanton cannot be recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited seventh, so Tao cannot be recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited third, so Villas could be recruited sixth.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Using the given information, we can create a timeline of the order in which the accomplices were recruited:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Peters
5. 
6. 
7. 

We know that Villas was recruited immediately before White, so we can add that to the timeline:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Peters
5. 
6. Villas
7. White

We also know that Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, so Rovero must be recruited before Tao. We also know that White was recruited earlier than Rovero, so White must be recruited before Rovero. Therefore, the timeline must look like this:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Peters
5. 
6. White
7. Rovero
8. Tao
9. Villas

Now we can answer the question:
A: Quinn was recruited first. - We know that Peters was recruited fourth, so Quinn cannot be recruited first. Eliminate.
B: Rovero was recruited third. - This is possible based on the timeline we created. Keep.
C: Stanton was recruited second. - We know that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so this is not possible. Eliminate.
D: Tao was recruited sixth. - We know that Tao was recruited after Rovero, so this is not possible. Eliminate.
E: Villas was recruited sixth. - We know that Villas was recruited before White, so this is not possible. Eliminate.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Using the given conditions, we can deduce that I must be on the middle shelf, and F and M must be on the same shelf. Also, since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we know that at least 3 books must be on the bottom shelf. 

Option A is not possible because it only has two books, and we know that at least three books must be on the bottom shelf.

Option B is not possible because H is on the bottom shelf, and we know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.

Option C is not possible because K is not on the bottom shelf.

Option D is possible because it has at least three books on the bottom shelf (F, G, and O), and F and M are on the same shelf.

Option E is not possible because L is not on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - Since there are 8 books and at least 2 books are placed on each shelf, there must be at least 2 books on the top shelf, 2 books on the middle shelf, and 4 books on the bottom shelf.
  - We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is not.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is not.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  - Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least F, M, and two other books.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - Choice A is not possible because it only has two books, and we know that there must be at least 4 books on the bottom shelf.
  - Choice B is possible because it has F, H, and M on the bottom shelf, which satisfies the conditions.
  - Choice C is not possible because it does not have any of the books that we know must be on the bottom shelf.
  - Choice D is not possible because it has O on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that more books must be on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - Choice E is not possible because it has L on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that O must be on a higher shelf than L.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  - Since there are at least 2 books on each shelf, and I is on the middle shelf, there must be at least 2 books on the middle shelf.
  - Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf.
  - F is on the same shelf as M, so they are either both on the top shelf, both on the middle shelf, or both on the bottom shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the bottom shelf.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  - If F and M are on the bottom shelf, then there are at least 3 books on the bottom shelf (F, M, and at least one other book). This satisfies the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - K cannot be on the bottom shelf, so it must be on the top or middle shelf. This satisfies the condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is on the bottom shelf, so O must be on the top or middle shelf. This satisfies the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - G and H are the only books left, and they must be on the middle shelf. This satisfies the condition that I is placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, the answer is D: F, G, M, O.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  - We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf while L is on the middle shelf.
  - We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  - We know that there are at least 2 books on each shelf, so we can eliminate choices A and B.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  - We know that I is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - We know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is not.
  - We know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is not.
  - We know that F is on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  - We know that there are at least 2 books on each shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least 2 books.
  
Analysis:
  - From the given information, we can deduce that F must be on the bottom shelf, and K and O must be on the top two shelves.
  - We also know that more books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf, so there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf.
  - The only answer choice that satisfies these conditions is B: F, H, M.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, they must be either both on the top shelf, both on the middle shelf, or both on the bottom shelf.
  - Since I is on the middle shelf, neither F nor M can be on the middle shelf.
  - Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf.
  - Since each shelf has at least 2 books, there can be at most 3 books on the top shelf and at most 3 books on the middle shelf.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  - F and M are on the same shelf, so they must be either both on the top shelf, both on the middle shelf, or both on the bottom shelf.
  - Since I is on the middle shelf, F and M cannot be on the middle shelf.
  - Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf, so it must be on the top or middle shelf.
  - Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf, so it must be on the top or middle shelf.
  - Since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and each shelf has at least 2 books, the only possible arrangement is: top shelf (G, K, O), middle shelf (I, L), bottom shelf (F, G, M, O). Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  A: F and M are on the same shelf, so this cannot be the bottom shelf.
  B: F and M are on the same shelf, so this cannot be the bottom shelf.
  C: K is not on the bottom shelf, so this cannot be the bottom shelf.
  D: This is a possible list of books placed on the bottom shelf. 
  E: L is not on the bottom shelf, so this cannot be the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we can eliminate choices A and C because they only have one book on the bottom shelf.
  - Since I is placed on the middle shelf, we can eliminate choices D and E because they do not have I on the middle shelf.
  - Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, we can eliminate choice B because it does not have M on the same shelf as F.
  - Therefore, the answer is choice D: F, G, M, O.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - Since F and M are on the same shelf, they cannot both be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since I is on the middle shelf, it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Therefore, the only books that could be on the bottom shelf are G, H, and L.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, they must be together on one of the shelves.
  - I is on the middle shelf, so the top shelf must have at least 2 books and the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top or middle shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top or middle shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books, and the possible books that could be on the bottom shelf are: F, G, H, L, M, O.
  - However, we know that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so we can eliminate choices C and E, which have only 3 books on the bottom shelf.
  - Choice A has only 2 books on the bottom shelf, so it is also eliminated.
  - Choice D has 4 books on the bottom shelf, which is possible, so it could be the correct answer.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, is a rule that affects the publication of M and N.
  A: This rule affects the publication of L and M, not M and N.
  B: This rule affects the publication of N and P, not M and N.
  C: This rule affects the publication of M and P, not M and N.
  D: This rule is the same as the original rule.
  E: This rule affects the publication of O and N, not M and N.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
Option D is the correct answer because it has the same effect as the original condition. If N is published in the spring, then M must also be published in the spring. This is equivalent to the original condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. The other options do not have the same effect as the original condition and would result in a different schedule for the publication of the cookbooks.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are six cookbooks: K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  - Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Action: Answer("D")
  
Explanation:
Option A is not correct because it only talks about L and M, and does not affect the relationship between M and N.
Option B is not correct because it talks about N and P, and does not affect the relationship between M and N.
Option C is not correct because it talks about M and P, and does not affect the relationship between M and N.
Option D is correct because it talks about N and M, which is the same relationship as the original condition.
Option E is not correct because it talks about O and N, and does not affect the relationship between M and N.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The original condition is: If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This condition does not have the same effect as the original condition.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This condition does not have the same effect as the original condition.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This condition does not have the same effect as the original condition.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This condition has the same effect as the original condition.
  E: If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This condition does not have the same effect as the original condition.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:

  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring, has the same effect as the original condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This is because K and N must be published in the same season as each other, and if K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring to satisfy the condition that K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six cookbooks: K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  - Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  - Since Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, we know that neither Isaacs nor Franz can have any more paintings displayed on walls 1 and 2.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 2.
  - Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, and since we know that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, we know that Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  - Therefore, the answer is C: Greene's watercolor.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student displays exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings are displayed on each of the walls 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  One painting is in the upper position and one in the lower position on each wall.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we know that Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or 4. However, we also know that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1. This means that Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 1. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Each of the four students will display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  - If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  - Since Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 1, then neither Franz nor Isaacs can have any other painting on wall 1.
  - Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 1.
  - Since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, then Hidalgo's oil must be on wall 1.
  - Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then Greene's oil cannot be on wall 1.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then:
  - Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1 (because no wall has only watercolors displayed on it and no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, and Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed).
  - Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 4 (because Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4 and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it).
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Each of the four walls has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we know that Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or 4. However, Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1 because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 4. We also know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of wall 3. This means that neither Hidalgo's oil nor Hidalgo's watercolor can be displayed on wall 3. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, we know that Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are four walls, each with an upper and lower position, and each wall displays exactly two paintings.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are four walls, and each wall has one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position, for a total of eight paintings.
  Each of the four students has one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student has two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  Each wall has two paintings: one oil and one watercolor, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  
  Based on the given information, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil. Therefore, Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1. Also, Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4, so it cannot be displayed on wall 1. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, we know that one of the paintings on wall 1 must be an oil. Therefore, the only option left is Hidalgo's watercolor.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each of the four walls has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1. This is because:
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4.
  - No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, so wall 2 must have one oil painting.
  - No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so wall 2 cannot have Franz's oil painting.
  - Wall 3 has Franz's oil painting, so it cannot have Greene's watercolor painting.
  - Therefore, Greene's watercolor painting must be on one of the walls 1, 2, or 4.
  - But Greene's watercolor painting is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so it must be on wall 1.
  - Therefore, Greene's oil painting must be displayed on wall 1.

  - Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then:
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. So, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which means that there will be no one left to give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, which means that there will be no one left to give a report on Monday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday.
  - Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so he can only give a report on Monday morning or Wednesday morning.
  - If Robert gives a report on Monday morning, then Olivia must give a report on Monday afternoon, and Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. This means that there will be no one left to give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Robert cannot give a report on Monday morning.
  - If Robert gives a report on Wednesday morning, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, and Nina must give a report on Monday or Wednesday. This means that Olivia must give a report on Monday or Tuesday. Therefore, Robert can give a report on Wednesday morning, and Olivia can give a report on Monday or Tuesday.
  
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday. This is possible, as long as Helen does not give a report on Tuesday.

  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  - If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then George must give his report on Tuesday, and Nina and Robert must give their reports on Monday and Wednesday, respectively.
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible because George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday, which is possible.
  - If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then Robert cannot give a report on Wednesday because he cannot give an afternoon report.
  - If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then Nina cannot give a report on Monday because if she does, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible because George can only give a report on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("E")  
If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be selected. If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Therefore, only Quinn and Smith are left to be selected, and Smith must be selected with Taylor. This means that the project leader will be Quinn or Ruiz. Thus, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 2, then Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 1 and Zone 3, respectively. This would mean that Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, leaving Kim to work in Zone 3. However, this would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Mahr and Stuckey cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3, then Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, respectively. This would mean that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, leaving the other to work in Zone 2. This would also mean that Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, leaving Kim to work in Zone 2. This satisfies all of the given conditions.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they are both in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. 
  If they are both in Zone 2, then Tiao cannot be in Zone 2, so Tiao must be in Zone 1, and Parra must be in Zone 3. 
  If they are both in Zone 3, then there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, so Parra and Tiao cannot both be in Zone 3. Therefore, Parra must be in Zone 1 and Tiao must be in Zone 2.
  
  A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 if Tiao is in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 1 if Parra is in Zone 1.
  C: Parra must work in Zone 1 if Tiao is in Zone 2 and Mahr and Stuckey are in Zone 3.
  D: If Mahr and Stuckey are in Zone 2, then Stuckey must also be in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao must work in Zone 2 if Mahr and Stuckey are in Zone 3 and Parra is in Zone 1.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that same sales zone. Therefore, there are at least 3 sales representatives working in that sales zone. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3, and so does Udall. Therefore, D: Stuckey works in Zone 2, could be true.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The company employs 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - The sales representatives work in 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that sales zone because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Mahr and Udall are already assigned to a sales zone, then it is possible that Stuckey is assigned to Zone 3.
  - From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. We don't know where Kim is assigned, so it is possible that Kim works in Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  - We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Since we don't know where Parra is assigned, it is possible that Parra and Quinn are assigned to either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:

  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they must both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. 
  A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there are fewer sales representatives working in Zone 2 than in Zone 3.
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  D: Stuckey can work in Zone 2 if Mahr also works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.

  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they are either both in Zone 2 or both in Zone 3. 
  A: We don't know where Kim works.
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  D: If Stuckey works in Zone 2, then Mahr must also work in Zone 2, which means there are more sales representatives working in Zone 2 than in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information.
  E: Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, Udall must work in Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. If Udall works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 2, so Tiao must work in Zone 1 and Parra must work in Zone 3.
  - If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must work in Zone 3 as well.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so at least three sales representatives must work in Zone 3.
  - Therefore, Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there would be at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. Therefore, the answer must be one of the choices that has either Zone 2 or Zone 3 as the sales zone for Stuckey.
  A: Kim works in Zone 2. - This choice does not provide any information about Mahr and Stuckey working in the same sales zone.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1. - This choice contradicts the given condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. - This choice does not provide any information about Mahr and Stuckey working in the same sales zone.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. - This choice satisfies the condition that Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1. - This choice contradicts the given condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in that zone because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Therefore, Udall must work in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  - If Udall works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 (because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2). However, this would mean that Parra works in Zone 3, which violates the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Therefore, Udall works in Zone 2.
  - This means that Tiao does not work in Zone 2 (because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2).
  - Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 1 (because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1).
  - This means that Parra works in Zone 3 (because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2).
  - This also means that Quinn works in Zone 3 (because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other).
  - Therefore, Kim works in Zone 2 (because all other sales representatives have been assigned to a zone).
  - The only answer choice that could be true is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they are both in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. 
  If they are both in Zone 2, then Tiao cannot be in Zone 2, so Tiao must be in Zone 1, which means Parra is not in Zone 1, and must be in Zone 3. This would mean there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Mahr and Stuckey must be in Zone 3, which means Parra is not in Zone 3, and must be in Zone 1. This also means that Tiao is in Zone 2, and there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  
Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. If R is not mentioned in chapter 2, then it can only be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 7. If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5, and W must be mentioned in chapter 7. If W is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or chapter 8, so Z must be mentioned in chapter 4. If Z is mentioned in chapter 4, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 5, so S must be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, A, B, and D are not possible. If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5, and W must be mentioned in chapter 3. If W is mentioned in chapter 3, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4, so S must be mentioned in chapter 6. Therefore, C is possible. If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then E is not possible because Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:

  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then:
- U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
- W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 (because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters).
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 (because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W).
- Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2.
- R is the only clue that has not been placed yet, and it cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or 2.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. (X, U, ?, T, W, ?, ?) 
  This is not possible because R cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.

B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. (X, U, ?, T, W, ?, R)
  This is possible because R can be mentioned in chapter 7.

C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. (X, ?, U, T, W, ?, ?)
  This is not possible because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. (X, U, ?, T, W, ?, R)
  This is possible because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.

E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3. (X, U, ?, T, ?, Z, ?)
  This is not possible because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each clue appears exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.

  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3 because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapter 6 and chapter 7 in some order.
  R must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4 because it cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 7.

Action: Answer("D")  
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 6.
  R must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  S and Z must be mentioned in chapter 6 and chapter 7 in some order.
  Therefore, it is possible that W is mentioned in chapter 5, and R is mentioned in chapter 7.
Response 6:

  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Since X is mentioned in chapter 1, we know that U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, and it must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5. Since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3. If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 3 and 4, respectively. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 7. If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 2 and 4, respectively. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 7.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 3 is not possible because R must be mentioned in chapter 7.
B: R is mentioned in chapter 7 is possible.
C: S is mentioned in chapter 2 is not possible because S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 if T is mentioned in chapter 2.
D: W is mentioned in chapter 5 is possible.
E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3 is not possible because Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 if T is mentioned in chapter 3.

  - Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then X and U must be mentioned in chapter 1 and 2, but we already know that X is mentioned in chapter 1, so U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and T must be mentioned before W with exactly two chapters separating them, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  - Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and T is mentioned in chapter 3, then S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 2, 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 6 and 7 in some order.
  - Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, if X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W could be mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.

  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and R must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4 and R must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 6 or later.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then R must be mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, the only possible option is B, which states that R is mentioned in chapter 7.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then which one of the following could be true?

  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Each section must have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have either two photographs by Fuentes and zero by Hue or one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue. Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, the Lifestyle section must have either two photographs by Hue and zero by Fuentes or one photograph by Hue and one by Fuentes. However, we know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, the only possible option is that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue and one is by Fuentes, and one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Fuentes. This leaves the possibility that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, so the answer is E.

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have one photograph by Fuentes and one photograph by Hue. According to the given conditions, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Lifestyle section must also have one photograph by Fuentes and one photograph by Hue. Finally, the Metro section must have at least one photograph by a photographer who also has a photograph in the Lifestyle section. Since Fuentes and Hue each have one photograph in the Lifestyle section, it is possible that both photographs in the Metro section are by Hue. Therefore, the answer is E.

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have either two photographs by Fuentes and zero by Hue, or one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue. However, we know that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, if there are two Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, there must be two Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section. This means that both photographs in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Hue (choice A is false). Additionally, we know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Metro section, this means that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Fuentes or Hue. Therefore, choice B is true. We do not have enough information to determine the contents of the Metro section, so choices C and D may or may not be true. However, since we know that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and we have already determined that there are no Gagnon photographs in the Sports section, this means that both photographs in the Sports section must be by Hue. Therefore, choice E is true.

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the two photographs in the Sports section must be taken by Fuentes and Hue.

Therefore, both photographs in the Lifestyle section must also be taken by Hue and Fuentes. Finally, at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Fuentes. Thus, the only option that could be true is that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then neither of those two photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have two photographs by the other two photographers, Fuentes and Hue. According to the condition, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Lifestyle section must have two photographs by Hue and the Metro section must have two photographs by Fuentes. Thus, both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, making choice E the correct answer.
Response 7:

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have either two photographs by Fuentes or one photograph by Fuentes and one photograph by Hue. However, we know that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, if the Sports section has one photograph by Fuentes and one photograph by Hue, then the Lifestyle section must also have one photograph by Hue and one photograph by Fuentes. This means that both photographs in the Lifestyle section are not by Hue, so we can eliminate choice A. Also, if the Sports section has two photographs by Fuentes, then the Lifestyle section must have two photographs by Hue, which eliminates choice B. Since the Lifestyle section has at least one photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, the only remaining option is that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, which means that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must also be two. This allows for the possibility that both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, so the correct answer is E.

If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have two photographs by Fuentes and Hue. According to the condition, the Lifestyle section must have at least one photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Metro section, the Lifestyle section must have at least one photograph by either Fuentes or Hue. However, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, both photographs in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Hue. Also, both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes since the Lifestyle section must have at least one photograph by Fuentes or Hue. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Answer("E").
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are six different photographs in total, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the two photographs in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and Hue. According to the condition, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, there must be one photograph by Hue and one photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section. Since there are no Gagnon's photographs in the Lifestyle section, option A and B are not possible. According to the condition, at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, option C is not possible. The only possible options are D and E. However, since there are already two photographs by Fuentes in the Sports section, there cannot be any Fuentes' photographs in the Metro section. Therefore, the only possible option is E, which states that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.

- The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 6th, because if it were, then the vase and the harmonica would have to be auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd, but the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.

  From the given conditions, we know that the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because if the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, which violates the condition that the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because if the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or later, which violates the condition that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 6th because if the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or earlier, which violates the condition that the vase is auctioned after the sundial. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.

  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We need to find the option that is impossible to achieve, no matter how many trades are made.
  
Analysis:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. - This is impossible because RealProp does not own any of these buildings.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. - This is possible if Southco trades the Lynch Building for the Meyer Building with Trustcorp.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. - This is impossible because Southco only owns two buildings.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. - This is possible if Trustcorp trades the Meyer Building for the Yates House with RealProp.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. - This is impossible because Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).

    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are all either class 1 or class 3. Therefore, it is impossible for RealProp to own the Meyer Building or the Ortiz Building, which are both class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp. Hence, option A cannot be true.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Meyer Building (class 2). This is possible because Southco can trade the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) owned by RealProp. Hence, option B can be true.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This is impossible because Southco only owns two buildings, the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Hence, option C cannot be true.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Yates House (class 3). This is possible because Trustcorp can trade the King Building (class 2) for the Garza Tower (class 1) owned by RealProp. Hence, option D can be true.

Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?

Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Tao was recruited second, Peters must have been recruited third.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White must have been recruited fifth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited first or second.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must have been recruited either third or sixth.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
  - If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order would be: Quinn, Tao, Peters, Villas, White, Stanton, Rovero.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first. 
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas was recruited seventh and White was recruited sixth.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn was recruited third and Rovero was recruited fifth.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton was recruited fourth or fifth.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
  If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton could have been recruited sixth.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be: 
  1. The first recruit
  2. Tao
  3. The third recruit
  4. Peters
  5. The fifth recruit
  6. Villas
  7. White
Based on this order, the following could be true:
  A: Quinn was recruited third. (Possible)
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth. (Not possible, Peters was recruited fourth)
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth. (Not possible, Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao)
  D: Villas was recruited sixth. (Not possible, White was recruited seventh)
  E: White was recruited third. (Not possible, Villas was recruited immediately before White)

Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] Tao, [2] ?, [3] ?, [4] Peters, [5] ?, [6] ?, [7] ?. 
  Quinn cannot be recruited second because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so he cannot be recruited second.
  Villas was not recruited second because Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so he cannot be recruited second.
  Therefore, Rovero could be recruited second, and White could be recruited third.

The following must be true:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so X must be Peters.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so X must be Villas and White in that order.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so X cannot be Stanton.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so X cannot be Quinn.
  
Therefore, the only option that could be true is:
Action: Answer("B") Rovero was recruited fifth.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  - If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is: [?, Tao, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is: [?, Tao, ?, Peters, ?, ?, ?]
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is: [?, Tao, ?, Peters, ?, Villas, White]
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so the order of recruitment is: [?, Tao, Quinn, Peters, ?, Villas, White]
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so the order of recruitment is: [?, Tao, Quinn, Peters, ?, Villas, White]
  - Therefore, the possible order of recruitment for the remaining accomplices is: [Rovero, Stanton] or [Stanton, Rovero]
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: If Tao was recruited second, and Peters was recruited fourth, then the order of recruitment is: [?, Tao, ?, Peters, ?, ?, ?]. Since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth, then Quinn must have been recruited third. Therefore, A is the correct answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.

  1. Unknown
  2. Tao
  3. Unknown
  4. Peters
  5. Unknown
  6. Unknown
  7. Unknown
  
  From the given information, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited third. Peters was recruited fourth, so he cannot be recruited third. Villas was recruited immediately before White, so she cannot be recruited third. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so he cannot be recruited sixth. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Rovero was recruited fifth.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Tao was recruited second, Peters must have been recruited third.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited fifth and White must have been recruited sixth.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must have been recruited seventh.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited first and Rovero must have been recruited last.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be: 
  1. The first recruit
  2. Tao
  3. The third recruit
  4. Peters
  5. The fifth recruit
  6. Villas
  7. White

Option A: If Tao was recruited second, then Quinn cannot be recruited third because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, A is not true.

Option B: If Tao was recruited second, then Rovero cannot be recruited fifth because Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, B is not true.

Option C: If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton cannot be recruited sixth because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, C is not true.

Option D: If Tao was recruited second, then Villas must be recruited sixth because Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, D could be true.

Option E: If Tao was recruited second, then White must be recruited seventh. Therefore, E is not true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Tao was recruited second, Peters must have been recruited third.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited fifth and White sixth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited first or second.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must have been recruited either third or sixth.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
  If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton could have been recruited sixth.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days.
  
Analysis:
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target cannot be 3 days.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Solide's website target cannot be 2 days if Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target cannot be 3 days if Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days.
  
Conclusion:
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days.
  - Solide's website target cannot be 3 days.
  - If Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days, then Image's voicemail target cannot be 3 days.
  - Therefore, the only possible option is that Truvest's website target is 2 days, Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days, and Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  - This means that Image's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and since Truvest's website target is 2 days, Image's website target must be 1 day.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - We are given that Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Since Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's voicemail target must be at least 1 day. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must be at most 2 days. Therefore, the only option that satisfies this condition is D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has two targets, one for website and one for voicemail.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days.
  
  If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be shorter than 1 day, which contradicts the given condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days and Truvest's voicemail target must be 3 days.
  
  Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day or 2 days.
  
  If Image's voicemail target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be shorter than 1 day, which contradicts the given condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 2 days.
  
  Since None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target must be 2 days as well.
  
  Finally, since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day.
  
  Therefore, the answer is E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has two targets: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  - Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  - Image has two targets: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide has two targets: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's voicemail target must be at least 2 days. This means that Image's voicemail target must also be 2 days, since it must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which means that Solide's website target must be 1 day. This also means that Truvest's website target must be 2 days. Therefore, Image's website target must be 2 days, since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days.
  
Analysis:
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target cannot be 3 days. It means that Solide's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Image's website target cannot be 3 days. It means that Image's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target cannot be 3 days. It means that Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  - If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then Solide's voicemail target must be 3 days, which violates the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company sets two service targets for each client, one for requests received through the website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's voicemail target must be 1 day, and Truvest's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days.
  
  If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be 1 day (because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target), and Image's voicemail target must be 2 days (because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets). However, this violates the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Truvest's website target cannot be 1 day.
  
  If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's voicemail target must be 1 day, and Image's voicemail target must be 2 days. This satisfies all the conditions. Solide's website target can be either 1 day or 2 days, as long as it is shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:

  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's voicemail target must be at least 2 days. This means that Image's voicemail target must also be 2 days, since it must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which means that Solide's website target must be at most 2 days. This leaves us with two possible options for Solide's website target: 1 day or 2 days.

  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days.
  
  If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must also be 1 day, which contradicts the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target must be 3 days.
  
  Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 2 days. 
  
  Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles is subject to the following conditions:
  1. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  2. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  3. S must be earlier than Y.
  4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles must be one of the following:
1. G H J _ S Q Y R
2. G H J _ Q S Y R
3. Q S _ Y G H J R
4. Q S _ G H J Y R

A: J cannot be second in any of the possible orders because G must be earlier than J.
B: J cannot be third in any of the possible orders because G must be earlier than J.
C: Q cannot be first in any of the possible orders because S must be earlier than Q if Q is not third.
D: Q can only be third in the second possible order.
E: R can only be seventh in the first possible order.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The articles can be ordered as follows: Q, R, S, G, H, J, Y.
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be Q, R, S.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  Therefore, the order of the last three articles must be J, G, R.
  The remaining article, H, can be placed in between S and J, or between G and Y.
  
Analysis:
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be Q, R, S. Therefore, Q cannot be first, and S cannot be earlier than Q. This eliminates choices C and D. 
  If J is second, then G must be third and R must be seventh. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. Therefore, choice A is not true.
  If J is third, then G must be second and R must be seventh. This satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, choice B is true.
  If R is seventh, then G must be sixth and J must be fifth. This violates the condition that J must be earlier than G. Therefore, choice E is not true.

Action: Answer("B")

  2. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  3. S must be earlier than Y.
  4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles could be one of the following:
- G, H, J, Y, Q, R, S
- H, G, J, Y, Q, R, S
- Q, R, S, Y, G, H, J
- R, Q, S, Y, G, H, J

A: J cannot be second in any of the possible orders.
B: J could be third in the first two possible orders.
C: Q cannot be first in any of the possible orders.
D: Q could be third in the third possible order.
E: R must be sixth in the fourth possible order.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven articles: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  - Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  - One article covers wildlife: Y.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles must be one of the following:
  1. Q, R, S, Y, G, H, J
  2. R, Q, S, Y, G, H, J
  3. S, Q, R, Y, G, H, J
  4. S, R, Q, Y, G, H, J
  
  A: J cannot be second in any of the possible orders.
  B: J must be third in order for G to be earlier than R.
  C: Q cannot be first in any of the possible orders.
  D: Q must be third in order for S to be earlier than Y.
  E: R must be seventh in any of the possible orders.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - G, H, and J cover finance.
  - Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  - Y covers wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles must be one of the following:
  1. S _ _ Y _ _ _
  2. Q _ _ Y _ _ _
  
  In the first scenario, we know that S must be first or second, and Q cannot be third. Therefore, the only possible order for the first three articles is S, G, and R. This means that J must be fifth and H must be sixth. So, the answer cannot be A, B, C, or D.
  
  In the second scenario, we know that Q must be first or second, and S must be third. Therefore, the only possible order for the first three articles is Q, G, and R. This means that J must be fifth and H must be sixth. So, the answer is D.

  If S is third, then Q must be first and R must be second.
  If J is earlier than G, and G is earlier than R, then J must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be first, second, or third. This means that Q must be third, second, or first, respectively. If Q is third, then S must be first, and R must be second. If Q is second, then S must be first, and R must be third. If Q is first, then R must be second, and S must be third. In all cases, J must be earlier than R. Therefore, J must be either first or second. If J is first, then G must be second, and H must be fifth. If J is second, then G must be first, and H must be fifth. In either case, Q cannot be first. Therefore, Q cannot be first, and Q cannot be seventh. This means that Q must be either second, third, fourth, or fifth. If Q is second, then R must be seventh. If Q is third, then R must be second. If Q is fourth, then R must be first. If Q is fifth, then R must be seventh. Therefore, the only option that must be true is D: Q is third.

  D: Q is fifth in the order QSRYGHJ.
  E: R is seventh in the order JHYGRSQ.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The articles are G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  G, H, and J cover finance.
  Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  Y covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then S must be third.
  The only possible order for the first three articles is Q, R, and S.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, so J must be first or second.
  If J is first, then G must be second, and H must be fifth. This leaves F and Y to be sixth and seventh, but F and Y cannot be consecutive, so this is not possible.
  If J is second, then G must be first, and H must be fifth. This leaves F and Y to be sixth and seventh, and since S is third, Q and R must be fourth and sixth, but they cannot be consecutive. Therefore, this is not possible.
  Therefore, J must be third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles is subject to the following conditions:
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles must be one of the following:
1. G, Q, R, Y, H, S, J
2. H, Q, R, Y, G, S, J
3. Q, G, R, Y, H, S, J
4. Q, H, R, Y, G, S, J

A: J cannot be second in any of the possible orders.
B: J cannot be third in any of the possible orders.
C: Q cannot be first in any of the possible orders.
D: Q can only be third in the fourth possible order.
E: R cannot be seventh in any of the possible orders.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?
Choices:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
  C: the western, the horror film
  D: the western, the mystery
  E: the western, the sci-fi film
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Elimination:
  - Choice A: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or 2. However, the horror film is also shown on screen 1 in this option, which violates the condition that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, this option cannot be accurate.
  - Choice B: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or 2. The mystery is not shown on screen 1, so it must be shown on screen 2. This option satisfies all the conditions and could be accurate.
  - Choice C: The western must be shown on either screen 1 or 2, and it must be shown before the horror film. This option satisfies all the conditions and could be accurate.
  - Choice D: The western must be shown on either screen 1 or 2, and it must be shown before the horror film. The mystery is not shown on screen 1, so it must be shown on screen 2. This option satisfies all the conditions and could be accurate.
  - Choice E: The western must be shown on either screen 1 or 2, and it must be shown before the horror film. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or 2. This option satisfies all the conditions and could be accurate.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be shown on screen 1. 
  Also, the romance is not shown on screen 2, so it cannot be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M.
  The western must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2 at 7 P.M. since it begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2 at 9 P.M.
  Therefore, the only possible combinations for screen 1 are: 
  - the western at 7 P.M. and the sci-fi film at 9 P.M.
  - the mystery at 7 P.M. and the horror film at 9 P.M.
  Choice A is possible, as the sci-fi film can be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M. and the horror film on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  Choice B is possible, as the sci-fi film can be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M. and the mystery on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  Choice C is possible, as the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the horror film on screen 2 at 9 P.M.
  Choice D is possible, as the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the mystery on screen 2 at 9 P.M.
  Choice E is NOT possible, as the western cannot be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M. since it begins before the horror film.
  Answer: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be shown on screen 1. 
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it cannot be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1.
  The western must be shown before the horror film, so it cannot be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or 2.
  Therefore, the only possible accurate list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. is the western and the mystery. 
  This means that the answer that CANNOT be an accurate list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. is E: the western, the sci-fi film.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies showing at the repertory theater: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.

  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  We need to determine which of the given options cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.
  From the given conditions, we know that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, options A, B, and E cannot be accurate lists of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.
  Option C is a possible list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, with the western starting at 7 P.M. and the horror film starting at 9 P.M.
  Option D is also a possible list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, with the western starting at 7 P.M. and the mystery starting at 9 P.M.

Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.

  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  Option A cannot be accurate because the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. since the western must be shown before the horror film. 
  Option B can be accurate since the sci-fi film can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the mystery can be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  Option C can be accurate since the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the horror film can be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  Option D can be accurate since the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the mystery can be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  Option E can be accurate since the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the sci-fi film can be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  Therefore, the answer is Option A. Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies showing at the repertory theater: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.

  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  We need to determine which of the given options CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.
  From the given conditions, we know that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, and the romance is not shown on screen 2. Also, the western begins at some time before the horror film does, and the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  Option A: The sci-fi film is shown on screen 1, which is not possible as the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  Option B: The sci-fi film is shown on screen 1, which is possible as the sci-fi film can be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  Option C: The western is shown on screen 1, which is possible as the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M.

Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.

Analysis:
  - Since screen 1 shows two movies, and the romance is not shown on screen 2, the romance must be shown on screen 1.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so neither of them can be shown on screen 1 with the romance.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does, so the western must be shown on screen 1 with the romance.
  - Therefore, the 7 P.M. movies on screen 1 must be the romance and the western.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2.
  - The horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 with the romance and the western, so it must be shown on screen 2.
  - The mystery must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2, since it cannot be shown with the horror film.
  - The western must be shown on screen 1, so the mystery must be shown on screen 2.
  - Therefore, the 7 P.M. movies on screen 2 must be the sci-fi film and the mystery.

Analysis:
  We need to determine which of the given options CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.
  Option A: The sci-fi film, the horror film - This is possible because the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3 and the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Option B: The sci-fi film, the mystery - This is possible because the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3 and the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Option C: The western, the horror film - This is possible because the western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  Option D: The western, the mystery - This is possible because the western begins at some time before the horror film does and the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Option E: The western, the sci-fi film - This is NOT possible because the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 1.
  
Action: Answer("E")

Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  According to the given conditions, the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 along with the sci-fi film. Thus, option B cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.

Analysis:
  We need to determine which of the given options CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.
  Option A: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2. The horror film must be shown after the western, so it cannot be shown on screen 1. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  Option B: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the mystery cannot be shown on screen 1. Therefore, option B is possible.

  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

A: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there would be no sales representative left to work in Zone 2 since Tiao and Udall cannot both work in Zone 2. This contradicts the given condition. Therefore, this statement must be false.
B: Kim and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, this statement must be false.
C: It is possible for Mahr and Stuckey to both work in Zone 3. Therefore, this statement may not be false.

  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 2, and the other one must work in Zone 3.

  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there would be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 2 and three sales representatives left to work in Zone 3, which would contradict the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, A is true.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there would be no sales representative left to work in Zone 2, which would contradict the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, B is false.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there would be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 2, which would contradict the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, C is true.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there would be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 2, which would contradict the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, D is true.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there would be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 2 and three sales representatives left to work in Zone 3, which would contradict the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, E is true.

B: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans would have to be featured on day 1, which violates the condition that Himalayans are not featured on day 1. Therefore, B cannot be true.
C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Greyhounds would have to be featured on day 4, which violates the condition that no breed can be featured on two consecutive days. Therefore, C cannot be true.
D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans would have to be featured on days 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which is not possible since Himalayans are only featured on three days. Therefore, D cannot be true.
E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers would have to be featured on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which is not possible since Rottweilers are not featured on day 7. Therefore, E cannot be true.

- Since there are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies, there are a total of 9 possible combinations of kitten and puppy breeds.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so any combination that does not include Greyhounds on day 1 is impossible.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, so any combination that includes a breed featured on day 1 on day 7 is impossible.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, so any combination that includes Himalayans on day 1 or on day 7 is impossible.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, so any combination that includes Rottweilers on day 7 or on any day that features Himalayans is impossible.

- Since there are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies, there are a total of 6 breeds that need to be featured over the 7 days.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on any other day that Himalayans are not featured.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Therefore, they can only be featured on days 2-4, 5-7, or some combination of those.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, they can only be featured on days 2-4 or 5-6.

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
- Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, they cannot be featured on every day that Greyhounds are (since Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and Himalayans are not featured on day 1).
- Option A is not possible since there are only 6 breeds that need to be featured over the 7 days.
- Option B is not possible since Greyhounds are not featured on every day that Himalayans are (since Himalayans are not featured on day 1).

Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")
Explanation: 
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day or 2 days. 
  Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, then Solide and Truvest's voicemail targets must be at least 3 days. 
  Therefore, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. 
  If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day. 
  This means that Image's website target must be 1 day, since it cannot be longer than its voicemail target. 
  Therefore, the only statement that is not necessarily true is A: Image's website target is 1 day. It could be 2 days if Image's voicemail target is 2 days. 
  Statements B, C, D, and E are all necessarily true based on the given conditions.

  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
  
  A: We don't know Image's website target, so we cannot determine if it is 1 day or not.
  B: If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day. This satisfies the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  C: If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. This satisfies the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  D: If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day. This satisfies the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is because there are only three photographers, and if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Gagnon. This means that Gagnon has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section, and therefore must have at least one photograph in the Metro section as well. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, it is not possible for both photographs in the Metro section to be by Gagnon. It is also not possible for both photographs in the Metro section to be by Fuentes, since Fuentes already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, the only possible option is that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. It is not possible for both photographs in the Sports section to be by Hue, since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. It is also not possible for neither photograph in the Sports section to be by Hue, since there are only three photographers and each photographer must have at least one photograph in total.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
- The remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
- The photograph in the Sports section that is by Fuentes must be the same as the photograph in the Lifestyle section that is not by Fuentes or Hue.
- The photograph in the Sports section that is by Hue must be the same as the photograph in the Metro section that is not by Fuentes or Hue.

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. - This cannot be true because there is already one photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section.
B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. - This cannot be true because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. - This could be true. If one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon. This satisfies all the given conditions.
D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - This cannot be true because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. - This cannot be true because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - There is no information about the third photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - There is at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Analysis:
  - A cannot be true because if both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there would be more than three photographs by Fuentes in total.
  - B cannot be true because none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so Gagnon cannot have both photographs in the Metro section.
  - C could be true because there is no information about the number of photographs in the Metro section by Hue.
  - D cannot be true because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and we already know that there is one photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section.
  - E could be true because there is no information about the photographers of the photographs in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that Gagnon's two photographs must be in the Metro and Sports sections. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, both photographs in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and Hue. Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which means that one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. This leaves one photograph in the Metro section, which could be by Hue. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. Choice C is the correct answer.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six different photographs, exactly two photographs per section in Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is because there are only three photographers, and we know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. If Fuentes and Hue are the only photographers with photographs in the Lifestyle section, then one of Hue's photographs must be in the Metro section. Therefore, choice C could be true.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that neither of them can have more than two photographs in total. Therefore, the third photograph for each of them must be in either the Metro or Sports section. Since we know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, we can conclude that Fuentes or Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section. This means that option A is not possible. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, option B is not possible. Option D is not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, if Fuentes has one photograph in the Sports section, then Hue must also have one photograph in the Sports section. This leaves us with option C or E. However, if neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue, then Fuentes must have two photographs in the Sports section, which is not possible. Therefore, the only possible option is C: exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - Hue has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Sports section.
  - Hue has at least one photograph in the Sports section.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. - This is not possible since Fuentes already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. - This is not possible since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. - This is possible since Hue has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section and Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Sports section.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - This is not possible since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. - This is not possible since Hue has at least one photograph in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")

  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - There is no information about the third photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, so either Fuentes or Hue has a photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Analysis:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This is not possible because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and we already know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. This is not possible because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and Gagnon has no photographs in the Sports section.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is possible because we know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes. Therefore, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue, and one photograph in the Metro section must be by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is not possible because the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section, and we already know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. This is possible because the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section, and we already know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes. Therefore, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue, and both photographs in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two photographs per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there are two possibilities for the third photographer in the Lifestyle section: Gagnon or Fuentes. 

- If the third photographer in the Lifestyle section is Gagnon, then there must be at least one photograph by Gagnon in the Metro section. However, since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, there cannot be any photographs by Gagnon in the Sports section. Therefore, both photographs in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and Hue, and there will be one photograph by Hue in the Metro section. This satisfies all the given conditions, and so (C) is possible.

- If the third photographer in the Lifestyle section is Fuentes, then there must be at least one photograph by Fuentes in the Metro section. However, since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, there must be one photograph by Hue in the Sports section. This means that there cannot be any photographs by Hue in the Metro section, and so (C) is not possible. 

Therefore, the only possible answer is (C).
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) has exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - There must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. This means that either Fuentes or Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. This means that if Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This is not possible because if Fuentes has a photograph in the Metro section, then Hue must have a photograph in the Sports section, which means that Hue must have a photograph in the Lifestyle section as well.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. This is not possible because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and Gagnon has no photographs in the Sports section.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is possible. If Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section. This means that there are two possibilities for the Metro section: either both photographs are by Gagnon, or one photograph is by Hue and the other is by Gagnon.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is not possible because if Hue has a photograph in the Sports section, then Fuentes must have a photograph in the Lifestyle section, which means that Fuentes must have a photograph in the Sports section as well.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. This is possible, but if neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue, then Fuentes must have two photographs in the Sports section, which means that Hue must have two photographs in the Lifestyle section. This violates the constraint that each photographer can have at most three photographs. Therefore, this option is not possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Analysis:
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then the remaining years (1922, 1923, and 1924) must be assigned to Louis/Tiffany, Tiffany/Louis, and Ryan/Onyx, respectively. This means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922, which is not possible since Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922.
- Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922, which means that the remaining years (1921, 1923, and 1924) must be assigned to Louis/Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx, respectively. This is possible since Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, and if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true?
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924. (No information about Mollie's assignment)
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. (Mollie can be assigned to 1922)
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. (No information about Mollie's assignment)
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. (Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922 because Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923)
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. (Mollie can be assigned to 1922)
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Analysis:
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then the remaining years (1922, 1923, and 1924) must be assigned to Louis/Tiffany, Tiffany/Louis, and Ryan, respectively. This means Onyx cannot be assigned to any year, which is a contradiction.
- Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
- If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then the remaining years (1921, 1923, and 1924) must be assigned to Louis/Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx, respectively. This assignment satisfies all the given conditions.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Analysis:
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then the remaining years will be assigned to Louis, Onyx, and Yoshio. This means that Tiffany and Ryan will not be assigned to the project, which contradicts the condition that if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921.
- If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then the remaining years will be assigned to Louis, Onyx, and Yoshio. This satisfies all the conditions, so Mollie must be assigned to 1922.

Action: Answer("B")

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then the remaining years would be assigned to Louis (1924), Tiffany (1923), and Onyx (1922). This would mean that Ryan and Yoshio would not be assigned to any year, which is not allowed. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then the remaining years would be assigned to Tiffany (1923), Mollie (1922), and Onyx (1921). This would mean that Ryan and Yoshio would not be assigned to any year, which is not allowed. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1924.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then the remaining years would be assigned to Tiffany (1923), Mollie (1922), and Ryan (1924). This would mean that Louis and Yoshio would not be assigned to any year, which is not allowed. Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1921.

  3. If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  4. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  5. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination:
  - Option A violates condition 1 because it only has four members.
  - Option B violates condition 3 because it includes Paine when Myers is on the team.
  - Option C violates condition 5 because it does not include Myers when Wong is on the team.
  - Option D satisfies all conditions and is a possible selection of employees for the team.
  - Option E violates condition 4 because it includes Wong without including Paine and Thomson.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination:
  A: Myers is on the team, so neither Ortega nor Paine can be. However, Paine is included in this selection, so this is not a possible selection.
  B: Ortega is on the team, so neither Myers nor Yoder can be. However, Wong must be on the team if Myers is not, so this is not a possible selection.
  C: This selection satisfies all the conditions, so it is a possible selection.
  D: This selection satisfies the condition that Schmidt is on the team and both Paine and Thomson must also be, but it does not satisfy the condition that Wong must be on the team if Myers is not. Therefore, this is not a possible selection.
  E: This selection satisfies the condition that Wong is on the team and both Myers and Yoder must also be, but it does not satisfy the condition that if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, this is not a possible selection.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 3. Therefore, there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 1. 
  A: We don't know where Kim works.
  B: We don't know where Mahr works.
  C: If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, and Udall must work in Zone 2. This means that there are only 2 sales representatives working in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  D: If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3, and Udall must work in Zone 2. This means that there are only 2 sales representatives working in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  E: If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well. This means that there are at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3, which is consistent with the given condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Udall can work in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 must have at least 3 sales representatives, and Zone 3 must have at most 2 sales representatives.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so if Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must also work in Zone 3, which means there are at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  Similarly, if Tiao works in Zone 1, then there are at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  This means that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, there must be exactly 1 sales representative in Zone 2. This means that either Mahr or Kim works in Zone 2, and the other works in Zone 3. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so if Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 3, which means there are at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 3.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the first day.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the first day. Therefore, Seamus must test either F, G, or H on the first day. However, we know that the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, Seamus must test H on the first day. This means that Theresa tests J on the first day, and Yuki tests F on the first day. On the second day, Reynaldo tests G, Seamus tests J, Theresa tests F, and Yuki tests H. Therefore, Yuki could test H on the second day. Answer choice C is correct.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will each test one of four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) on the first day, and each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test H on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day.
  
Analysis:
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the first day. So, Seamus must test F, G, or H on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test H on the first day. So, Yuki must test F or G on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day. So, Reynaldo must test F, H, or J on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test F, G, or H on the first day. If Seamus tests F or G on the first day, then Yuki will test H on the first day, which is not possible. Therefore, Seamus must test H on the first day. Then, Yuki will test G on the first day. On the second day, Reynaldo must test F or J, but he cannot test G. Therefore, Reynaldo must test H on the second day. This leaves G for Theresa to test on the second day, and Yuki to test J on the second day, which satisfies all the conditions.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day.
  
Analysis:
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day. Therefore, Yuki must test either F, G, or H on the first day.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, if Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test H on the first day.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, Seamus must test either F, G, or H on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F. Therefore, Reynaldo must test either G, H, or J on the second day.
  - Theresa cannot test G. Therefore, Theresa must test either F or J on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("C") - Yuki tests H on the second day.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days.
  - Each rider will test only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day.
  
Analysis:
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day. Therefore, J must be tested by either Reynaldo, Seamus, or Theresa on the second day.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, Theresa must test H on the second day.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, Seamus must test the bicycle that Theresa tested on the first day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F. Therefore, Reynaldo must test G on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the first day.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day on the second day. Therefore, Seamus cannot test H on the first day. Since Theresa must be one of the testers for H, she cannot test J on the second day. Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test G on the second day. This leaves Yuki to test H on the second day, which is allowed. Therefore, Yuki could test H on the second day if Theresa tests J on the first day. So, the answer is (C).
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. (It is possible since Reynaldo has not been assigned to G or J on the first day.)
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day. (It is not possible since Theresa must be one of the testers for H.)
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day. (It is not possible since Theresa has tested J on the first day, and Yuki cannot test J on the second day.)
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. (It is not possible since the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, and Yuki cannot test J on the first day.)
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. (It is possible since Theresa has not been assigned to G or H on the first day.)

Analysis:
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day. Therefore, Yuki must test either F, G, or H on the first day.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, Theresa cannot test F, G, or J on the first day. So, Theresa must test either bicycle F or G on the first day.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, Seamus must test either F or G on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F. Therefore, Reynaldo must test either G, H, or J on the first day and the remaining bicycle on the second day.
  - Seamus cannot test H on the first day because Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, Seamus must test G on the first day and H on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("C") - Yuki tests H on the second day.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days.
  - Each rider will test only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. (It is possible. Reynaldo can test either H or J on the first day, and then test G on the second day.)
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day. (It is not possible. Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so she cannot test J on the first day.)
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day. (It is possible. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki can test either F or G on the first day, and then test H on the second day.)
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. (It is not possible. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day, and Seamus cannot test J on the second day.)
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. (It is not possible. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then she cannot test G on the first day.)
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day.
  
Analysis:
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day. Therefore, Yuki must test either F, G, or H on the second day.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, Reynaldo and Seamus must test F, G, and J on the first day.
  - If Seamus tests H on the first day, then Yuki must test G on the first day, and Reynaldo must test J on the first day. However, this would violate the condition that the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Therefore, Seamus cannot test H on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test H on the second day. Therefore, Seamus cannot test H on the first day.
  - Therefore, Seamus must test either F, G, or J on the first day.
  - If Seamus tests F on the first day, then Reynaldo must test G, Yuki must test H, and Theresa must test J on the first day. However, this would violate the condition that Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - If Seamus tests G on the first day, then Reynaldo must test F, Yuki must test H, and Theresa must test J on the first day. On the second day, Reynaldo must test G, Yuki must test either F or H, and Seamus must test either F or J. Therefore, A, C, and D are possible.
  - If Seamus tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo must test F, Yuki must test H, and Theresa must test G on the first day. However, this would violate the condition that Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - Therefore, the answer is A, C, or D.

  6. If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by...
  
Solution:
  1. If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  2. From condition 3, George must give his report on Tuesday.
  3. From condition 4, Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Therefore, they must give morning reports.
  4. From condition 5, if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday. So, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  5. From condition 5, if Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday. So, Nina must give a report on Monday.
  6. From condition 2, exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Therefore, Helen and Irving must give afternoon reports on Tuesday.
  7. From condition 2, exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Therefore, George and Robert must give afternoon reports on Wednesday.
  8. From condition 2, exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Therefore, Olivia and Helen must give morning reports on Monday.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  A: Helen, George, and Nina are the students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, only if Irving and Robert give reports on Monday and Olivia gives a report on Wednesday. However, Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so this option is not possible.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen are the students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, only if Nina gives a report on Monday and Olivia gives a report on Wednesday. However, Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so this option is not possible.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia are the students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, only if George and Irving give reports on Monday and Robert gives a report on Tuesday. However, Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so this option is not possible.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving are the students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, only if George and Helen give reports on Monday and Nina gives a report on Tuesday. However, if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday, which violates the condition that Robert cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen are the students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, only if Nina gives a report on Monday and Olivia gives a report on Wednesday. However, Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so this option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday. Also, neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, or else Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday. This means that Nina must give a report on Wednesday. Since exactly two reports are given each day, and George cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday, then George must give a report on Tuesday. This leaves Helen, Irving, and Robert to give reports on Monday. Since Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports, they are not relevant to the answer.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 8 students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.

  4. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  5. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  6. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only 6 students left to give reports. Therefore, George, Olivia, and Robert will not give reports.
  
  A: Helen, George, and Nina - George cannot give a report, so this is not possible.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen - Robert cannot give a report in the afternoon, so this is not possible.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia - George, Olivia, and Robert will not give reports, so this is not possible.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - Robert cannot give a report in the afternoon, so this is not possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we only know that F must be on a different shelf than I and M. We don't know anything about the placement of K, L, G, or H. Therefore, this statement is not enough to fully determine the placement of each book.

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know anything about the placement of I, L, F, M, or H. Therefore, this statement is not enough to fully determine the placement of each book.

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must also be on that shelf. We also know that I is on a different shelf, and that K and O are on higher shelves than F and L. Therefore, this statement is enough to fully determine the placement of each book.

D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we don't know anything about the placement of I, L, F, K, or O. Therefore, this statement is not enough to fully determine the placement of each book.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we don't know anything about the placement of I, L, F, K, G, or M. Therefore, this statement is not enough to fully determine the placement of each book.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F is not on that shelf, so we can determine which shelf F is on based on the other conditions. However, we cannot determine the exact placement of the other books, so this choice is not fully determined.
  - If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we know that K is not on the bottom shelf, so it must be on the top or middle shelf. We also know that F is not on the same shelf as K, so it must be on the bottom shelf. However, we cannot determine the exact placement of the other books, so this choice is not fully determined.
  - If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that F is on the bottom shelf. We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the middle or top shelf. We also know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf. Finally, we know that I is on the middle shelf, so we can determine the exact placement of all the books. Therefore, this choice is fully determined.
  - If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F is on the same shelf as M, so it must be on the top or middle shelf. We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf. However, we cannot determine the exact placement of the other books, so this choice is not fully determined.
  - If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that O is not on the bottom shelf, so it must be on the top or middle shelf. We also know that L is on a lower shelf than O, so L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. However, we cannot determine the exact placement of the other books, so this choice is not fully determined.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on a different shelf than I and M, because F is on the same shelf as M. We also know that K and O must be on the bottom shelf, because they are the only two books left and more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. However, we don't know where the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top or middle shelf. We also know that I and M are on the same shelf, because F is on the same shelf as M and I is on the middle shelf. Therefore, K and G must be on the top or middle shelf, and the remaining books (F, H, L, O) must be on the bottom shelf. However, we don't know the exact placement of each book on the shelves, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must be on the same shelf as well, because F is on the same shelf as M. We also know that K and O must be on the bottom shelf, because they are the only two books left and more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. However, we don't know where the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on the same shelf as well, because F is on the same shelf as M. We also know that K and O must be on the bottom shelf, because they are the only two books left and more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. However, we don't know where the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that K must be on the top or middle shelf, because K is placed on a higher shelf than F and F is not on the same shelf as H and O. We also know that I and M are on the same shelf, because F is on the same shelf as M and I is on the middle shelf. Therefore, K must be on the top or middle shelf, and the remaining books (F, G, L) must be on the bottom shelf. However, we don't know the exact placement of each book on the shelves, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
  - I is on the middle shelf
  - K is on a higher shelf than F
  - O is on a higher shelf than L
  - F is on the same shelf as M
  
  A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on. We know that F must also be on that shelf, but we don't know which shelf it is.
  B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on. We know that F must be on a lower shelf than K, but we don't know which shelf I, L, M, or O are on.
  C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on. We know that M must also be on that shelf, but we don't know which shelf I, K, or O are on.
  D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, we know that K, F, and M are on the same shelf. Therefore, I, L, and O must be on the remaining shelf, which is the middle shelf. And since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, H and G must be on the bottom shelf, and the remaining book, which is N, must be on the top shelf.
  E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on. We know that L must be on a lower shelf than O, but we don't know which shelf I, F, K, G, or M are on.

  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on the remaining shelf with K and L. However, we don't know which shelf that is, so this is not enough to fully determine the placement of all the books.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we know that K must be on the top or middle shelf, and F must be on the remaining shelf with I, L, M, and O. However, we don't know which shelf F is on, so this is not enough to fully determine the placement of all the books.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on the bottom shelf with K, and L must be on the middle or top shelf with I, M, and O. However, we don't know which shelf L is on, so this is not enough to fully determine the placement of all the books.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on the remaining shelf with I, K, L, and O. However, we don't know which shelf F is on, so this is not enough to fully determine the placement of all the books.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that O must be on the top or middle shelf, and L must be on the remaining shelf with I, F, K, and M. However, we don't know which shelf L is on, so this is not enough to fully determine the placement of all the books.

  - If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the top shelf, and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - If F is on the same shelf as M, then F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, then they must be on the middle or bottom shelf. If F is on the middle or bottom shelf, then M must be on the same shelf as F, and K and I must be on the remaining shelf, which is the top shelf. Finally, G and H must be on the bottom shelf, and O must be on the top shelf. Therefore, the placement of all the books is fully determined.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on the remaining shelf with L and O. However, we do not know which shelf that is, and we do not know where K, G, and H are placed. Therefore, this statement does not fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we do not know where any of the other books are placed. Therefore, this statement does not fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must be on the remaining shelf with I and O. However, we do not know which shelf that is, and we do not know where K, G, and H are placed. Therefore, this statement does not fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on the remaining shelf with L and O. However, we do not know which shelf that is, and we do not know where K, G, and I are placed. Therefore, this statement does not fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that L and F must be on the remaining shelf. We also know that K and G must be on the top shelf, and I and M must be on the middle shelf. Therefore, this statement fully determines which shelf each book is placed on.

  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on a different shelf than I and M. We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, so this creates a contradiction. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we do not have enough information to determine the placement of the other books. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must also be on that shelf. This means that I cannot be on the same shelf as F, so I must be on the top or bottom shelf. However, we do not have enough information to determine the placement of the other books. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must also be on that shelf. This means that I cannot be on the same shelf as F and M, so I must be on the top or bottom shelf. We also know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top or middle shelf. This leaves K and G to be placed on the bottom shelf. Therefore, this statement is true.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that L and F must also be on that shelf. This means that M and I cannot be on the same shelf as H, O, L, and F, so they must be on the remaining shelf. However, this violates the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.

  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: If H is fourth, we don't know which articles come before or after it, so the order is not fully determined.
B: If H is sixth, we don't know which articles come before or after it, so the order is not fully determined.
C: If R is fourth, we know that Q must be third, and S must be earlier than Q, so S must be first or second. Since S must be earlier than Y, Y must be sixth or seventh. Therefore, the order is fully determined: S, Q, R, G, J, Y, H.
D: If R is seventh, we don't know which articles come before or after it, so the order is not fully determined.
E: If Y is fifth, we know that S must be earlier than Y, so S must be first, and Q must be third. Since G must be earlier than R, G must be fourth, and J must be fifth. Therefore, the order is fully determined: S, Q, R, G, J, Y, H.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:

  There are seven articles to edit, and they can be grouped into three categories: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the order of the finance articles can be either GHJ or JHG. The order of the nutrition articles can be either QRS or RSQ. The order of the wildlife article can be either Y or Y can be placed anywhere after S. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
  If H is sixth, then the order of the finance articles can be either JHG or GHJ. The order of the nutrition articles can be either QRS or RSQ. The order of the wildlife article can be either Y or Y can be placed anywhere before S. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
  If R is fourth, then the order of the finance articles can only be JHGRS. The order of the nutrition articles can only be QY. Therefore, the order is fully determined.
  If R is seventh, then the order of the finance articles can only be HJG. The order of the nutrition articles can only be SQY. Therefore, the order is fully determined.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf.
  - Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there are at least 4 books on the bottom shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the same shelf as M.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is on the middle shelf.
  - If F and M are on the same shelf, then they cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  - Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf with I.
  - Since G is on the top shelf, H and L must be on the bottom shelf.
  - That leaves only K and O to be placed on the middle shelf.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
If G is placed on the top shelf, then F and M must be on the bottom or middle shelf. Since there are at least two books on each shelf, we can conclude that F and M are on the middle shelf. Therefore, I and L must be on the top and bottom shelves, respectively. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the middle shelf. This leaves us with the following books on each shelf:
- Top shelf: G, I
- Middle shelf: F, M, O
- Bottom shelf: H, K, L

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are 2 books on the top shelf and at least 2 books on the middle shelf. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, then the other book on the middle shelf must be either H, K, L, M, or O. However, we know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf if F is on the same shelf as M. We also know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the middle shelf if L is not. Therefore, the only possible book on the middle shelf with I is L. This means that the complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is I and L.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
If G is placed on the top shelf, then F and M must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves, but it is not clear where H, I, K, L, and O should be placed. However, we know that I must be placed on the middle shelf, so the only option that includes I on the middle shelf is D: I, K, L. Therefore, the answer is D. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.

  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf. Since there are at least 2 books on each shelf, then there are exactly 2 books on the top shelf. Therefore, there are 6 books on the bottom two shelves. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, then there is only one book left to be placed on the middle shelf. 

  A: H, I -> H cannot be placed on the middle shelf because there is only one book left to be placed on the middle shelf.
  B: I, L -> L cannot be placed on the middle shelf because O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  C: H, I, L -> H cannot be placed on the middle shelf because there is only one book left to be placed on the middle shelf. L cannot be placed on the middle shelf because O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  D: I, K, L -> This is possible. If G is placed on the top shelf, then the remaining books (F, H, I, K, L, M, O) are placed on the bottom two shelves. Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, then they are both on the same shelf. Therefore, the books on the middle shelf are I and either K or L.
  E: F, I, M -> This is not possible because G is placed on the top shelf, so F and M cannot be on the same shelf.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf. This means that there are at least 2 books on the middle shelf and at least 3 books on the bottom shelf. We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we need to find which of the answer choices includes I and at least one other book that can be placed on the middle shelf.

  A: H, I - If H is placed on the middle shelf, then there are only 2 books on the bottom shelf, which is not possible. Eliminate A.
  B: I, L - If L is placed on the middle shelf, then there are only 2 books on the bottom shelf, which is not possible. Eliminate B.
  C: H, I, L - If H is placed on the middle shelf, then there are only 2 books on the bottom shelf, which is not possible. Eliminate C.
  D: I, K, L - K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf. Eliminate D.
  E: F, I, M - F and M are on the same shelf, so they cannot be on different shelves than I. Eliminate E.

  Therefore, there is no answer choice that could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf if G is placed on the top shelf.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("D") 

If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, it means that the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. Since the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase, it means that the mirror and the vase are auctioned on June 1st to June 4th. Therefore, it is possible that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. Hence, the answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the harmonica and the sundial must be auctioned before the table.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - The mirror must be auctioned after the sundial, so it must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - The vase must be auctioned after the sundial, so it must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - The harmonica must be auctioned before the table, so it must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The table cannot be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd because the harmonica must be auctioned before the table. The table cannot be auctioned on June 4th because the harmonica must be auctioned before the table and the harmonica is already auctioned on June 4th. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then it is possible that the table is auctioned on June 6th, the lamp is auctioned on June 5th, and the vase is auctioned on June 4th. This means that choice B is possible.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the harmonica must be auctioned on a later date than the table.
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the lamp must be auctioned on a later date than the table.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the only option that could be true is that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("D") 

Explanation: 
If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. 
If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table, then it must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th. But the table is not auctioned on any of these dates. Therefore, A is not true.
If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then it must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. But the mirror and the vase are both auctioned on later dates than the table, so the lamp must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. Therefore, B is not true.
If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then it must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. But the sundial is not auctioned on any of these dates. Therefore, C is not true.
If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. But the table is auctioned on a later date than both the mirror and the vase, so this is possible. Therefore, D could be true.
If the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. But the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the mirror and the vase, so the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, which means the lamp cannot be auctioned on either of those dates. Therefore, E is not true.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the harmonica and the sundial must be auctioned before the table.
  - Therefore, A and C are not possible.
  - B is not possible because the table is auctioned after the lamp.
  - D is possible because the mirror can be auctioned before the vase.
  - E is not relevant to the question.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the harmonica and the sundial must be auctioned before the table.
  - The harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, so B is not possible.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so C is not possible.
  - The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, so D is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  
  A: It is possible that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table, as the table is only auctioned on an earlier date than either the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  B: It is not possible for the table to be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, as the table is only auctioned on an earlier date than either the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  C: It is not possible for the table to be auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, as the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  D: It is possible that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, as the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: It is not possible for the sundial to be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, as the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and the harmonica is not necessarily auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, because it is auctioned before both the mirror and the vase.
  - Since the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase, it cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, because the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned before the table, and the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd, respectively. The mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd and June 4th, respectively. Therefore, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, and choice B is not true.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd, respectively. The mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd and June 5th, respectively. Therefore, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, and choice B is true.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd, respectively. The mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd and June 6th, respectively. Therefore, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, and choice B is true.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned before the table, because the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  - Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 6th, and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th.
  - The lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd.
  
Knowledge:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table. (False)
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. (False)
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial. (False)
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. (True)
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. (False)

  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned before the table because the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  - If the harmonica is not auctioned before the table, then the only possible date for the harmonica is June 6th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 6th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th because the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp if the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - If the lamp is auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, then the only possible date for the mirror is June 3rd.
  - If the mirror is auctioned on June 3rd, then the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd because the sundial is auctioned before the vase.
  - If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the only possible date for the sundial is June 1st.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.

  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Therefore, the restaurant must be in space 1 or 7.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the restaurant cannot be in space 1 or 7.
  - If the restaurant is in space 6, then the pharmacy must be in space 4 and the optometrist must be in space 3. This means that the toy store cannot be in space 2 or 4, so it must be in space 1. The shoe store must be in space 2 and the other restaurant must be in space 7. Therefore, the answer is not A, B, D, or E.
  - If the restaurant is in space 1, then the pharmacy must be in space 6 and the veterinarian must be in space 4. This means that the toy store cannot be in space 3 or 5, so it must be in space 7. The shoe store must be in space 3 and the other restaurant must be in space 2. Therefore, the answer is C.

Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Solution:
  - If forest is used in a multicolored rug, then it must be used with two other colors, but neither of them can be turquoise. This means that forest can only be used with olive, peach, white, or yellow. Therefore, A is not necessarily true.
  - If turquoise is used in a multicolored rug, then it cannot be used with forest, peach, or yellow. This means that turquoise can only be used with olive, white, or another shade of turquoise. Therefore, B must be true.
  - According to the rules, peach must be used in any rug that contains olive. Therefore, C must be true.
  - According to the rules, turquoise cannot be used with peach in any rug. Therefore, D is not necessarily true.

  - Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures, each on a different topic.
  - The topics are: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian will give a lecture on a different topic.
  - The lectures will be given one at a time.
  - The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints:
    - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
    - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
    - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

Solution:
  We need to check each option to see if it violates any of the constraints:
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
    - This is not possible because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, and the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
    - This is possible because there are no constraints that prevent Garcia from giving the sculptures lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
    - This is not possible because Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, and Jiang's lecture must be on a topic later than the watercolors lecture. Therefore, Garcia cannot give the watercolors lecture.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
    - This is possible because there are no constraints that prevent Holden from giving the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
    - This is not possible because the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture, and Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Jiang cannot give the watercolors lecture.

Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.

  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Action: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project. Therefore, Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany must be assigned to the project. 
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which means Ryan must be assigned to the project. However, this would mean that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is not possible since there is no year before 1921. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to any year, since Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923, which means Tiffany and Ryan cannot be assigned to the project. However, this would mean that Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, which is not possible since there are no students left to be assigned to 1923 or 1924. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, Tiffany must be assigned to the project, and Louis must be assigned to 1924. This is a valid assignment.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922, which is not possible since there are no students left to be assigned to 1923 or 1924. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1924.

  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany. 
  From the given conditions, we know that if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, if Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, if Mollie is not assigned to the project, then Louis, Onyx, Ryan, or Tiffany must be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  If Onyx is assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, and Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, it could be true that Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - There are six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Action: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, it means that there are only five students available for the project. 
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there are only four students left, which means that there is no one to be assigned to 1923, which contradicts the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, A is not true.
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then there is no one to be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which contradicts the condition that if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, B is not true.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students left, which means that there is no one to be assigned to 1923, which contradicts the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, C is not true.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923 (because Tiffany is not available), and Louis must be assigned to 1924. This leaves Mollie to be assigned to 1921. Therefore, D could be true.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1924, then there are only four students left, which means that there is no one to be assigned to 1923, which contradicts the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, E is not true.
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - There are six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Action: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, it means that there are only five students available for the project. 
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there are only four students available for the project. This is not possible because there are four years to cover, and each year must have one student assigned to it.
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project because if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. This is not possible because there are only four years to cover, and each year must have one student assigned to it.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. This is not possible because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, Tiffany must be assigned to 1924, and Louis must be assigned to 1921. This is possible because Mollie is not assigned to the project, and there are no restrictions on Onyx being assigned to 1922.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, Ryan must be assigned to 1922, and Onyx must be assigned to 1921. This is possible because Mollie is not assigned to the project, and there are no restrictions on Louis being assigned to 1924.
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - There are six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Action: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, it means that there are only 5 students available for the project. 
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there are only 4 students available for the project, which means that one of the years will not have a student assigned to it. This is not possible since each year must have exactly one student assigned to it.
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then it means that Tiffany is not assigned to the project (because if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project). This means that there are only 4 students available for the project, which means that one of the years will not have a student assigned to it. This is not possible since each year must have exactly one student assigned to it.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then it means that Louis must be assigned to 1923 (because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923). This means that Ryan must be assigned to the project (because if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project). This means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922 (because if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's). This leaves Mollie to be assigned to 1921. Therefore, this option is possible.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then it means that Ryan must be assigned to 1923 (because if Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to the year immediately after Onyx's). This means that Tiffany must be assigned to the project (because if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project). This means that Louis cannot be assigned to the project (because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany is already assigned to the project). This leaves Mollie and Yoshio to be assigned to 1921 and 1924, respectively. Therefore, this option is possible.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1924, then it means that Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 (because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923). This means that Ryan must be assigned to the project (because if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project). This means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922 (because if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's). This leaves Mollie to be assigned to 1921. Therefore, this option is possible.
  
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - There are four years to be assigned, and each year must have exactly one student assigned to it.
  - There are six students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany. Since there are four years to be assigned, one of the students will not be assigned to any year. However, we know that if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then it is possible that Onyx is assigned to 1922 (which is the year immediately prior to Ryan's). Thus, the correct answer is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - There are six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Action: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, it means that there are only five students available for the project. 
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there are only four students available for the project, which is not enough to assign one student to each of the four years. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project, because if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923, which contradicts the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, which contradicts the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which contradicts the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1924.
  
Therefore, the answer is B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - There are four years to be assigned, and four students will be assigned to them.
  - Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the four students who will be assigned to the project are Louis, Mollie, Ryan, and Tiffany. 
  - Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so one of them will be assigned to it.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, so Ryan will be assigned to one of the years.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, so Onyx will be assigned to one of the years.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, so Mollie will be assigned to one of the years.
  - Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Onyx is assigned to 1922.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order, from first through seventh, in which the realtor shows the houses?
Choices:
  A: K, 0, L, M, N, J, P
  B: N, L, P, K, M, 0, J
  C: 0, P, K, L, N, M, J
  D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J
  E: P, 0, K, J, L, N, M
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses in a single day, with specific rules for when each house can be shown.
  J must be shown in the evening, so it must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so it must be either the fourth or fifth house shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so they must be either houses 1 and 2 or houses 3 and 4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Using the rules, we can determine that:
  - J must be the last house shown, so it is either house 6 or 7.
  - K cannot be shown in the morning, so it is either house 3, 4, or 5.
  - L must be shown after K and before M, so it is either house 4 or 5.
  - The first and second houses are shown in the morning, so they are either houses 1 and 2 or houses 3 and 4.
  Putting these together, we can see that the only possible order is:
  1. Either house 1 or 2 (morning)
  2. Either house 1 or 2 (morning)
  3. Either house 3, 4, or 5 (afternoon)
  4. Either house 4 or 5 (afternoon)
  5. Either house 3, 4, or 5 (afternoon)
  6. Either house 6 or 7 (evening)

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. M is published in the fall.
  2. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  3. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  4. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  5. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Using condition 5, if M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall. Using condition 3, K and N must be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, K cannot be published in the fall either. Using condition 4, if K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, O cannot be published in the spring. Using condition 2, M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, P cannot be published in the fall. This leaves us with L and 0 as the only two cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall. 
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, K and O cannot be published in different seasons. 
  Therefore, K and N must be published in the fall along with M. 
  The only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and N.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. P cannot be published in the fall, so it must be published in the spring along with L. Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. This means that P cannot be published in the fall, so the only possible pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, we know that N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. This means that the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M are K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, K cannot be published in the fall with M.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, P cannot be published in the fall with M.
  - This leaves us with two cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M: L and O.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then we know that P is performed before S. Therefore, P cannot be first or second. Also, since O is performed either first or fifth, it cannot be fourth. Therefore, the only possible compositions that could be performed first, second, and third are R, F, and T (in some order).
  
  A: H cannot be performed before S.
  B: H cannot be performed before S.
  C: O is performed first, which violates the condition that O is performed either first or fifth.
  D: O is performed first, which violates the condition that O is performed either first or fifth.
  E: R, F, and T are the only possible compositions that could be performed first, second, and third, and they are not in the correct order.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed before S must be O and either F or R. The compositions performed after S must be P and either F or R. Therefore, the possible orders for the first three compositions are:
  - O, F, P
  - O, F, R
  - O, R, P
  - O, R, F
  
  A: F, H, P - Not possible since F must be performed after O or R.
  B: H, P. L - Not possible since the eighth composition must be either L or H.
  C: O, P, R - Possible order for the first three compositions.
  D: O, P, T - Not possible since T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  E: P, R, T - Not possible since O must be performed either first or fifth.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The compositions must be performed consecutively and one composition at a time.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions that can be performed before S are O, F, R, and T. 
  From the given options, the only list that can be performed before S is O, P, T. 
  This is because O must be performed either first or fifth, and P must be performed before S. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: O, P, T. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the compositions must satisfy the following conditions:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed before S must be O and either F or R. 
  The composition performed after S must be either F or R and the composition performed after that must be either T or L/H.
  
  A: F, H, P - If P is performed after S, then F and R must be performed before S, which means that T or L/H must be performed after S. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  B: H, P. L - If S is performed fourth, then H, L, and P must be performed after S. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  C: O, P, R - If S is performed fourth, then F and T/L/H must be performed after R. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  D: O, P, T - If S is performed fourth, then F and R must be performed before S. Therefore, this option is possible.

  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed before S must be O and either F or R. 
  Since O is performed either first or fifth, and P is performed before S, then P must be performed second or third. 
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H, so it cannot be performed before S. 
  Therefore, the possible compositions performed first, second, and third are O, P, and either F or R.
  
  A: F, H, P - This is not possible because F cannot be performed after P.
  B: H, P, L - This is not possible because L cannot be performed before S.
  C: O, P, R - This is possible because O can be performed first, P can be performed second, and R can be performed third.

Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo, bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types, and so on until bay 6 holds the last remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  Bay 4 is between bay 3 and bay 5. 
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so the bay holding textiles must be bay 3 and the bay holding livestock must be bay 5.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so the bay holding produce must be bay 4 or bay 6.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain must be bay 6.
  Therefore, bay 4 cannot hold produce because produce must be in bay 6.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Each of the four walls has one upper and one lower position for displaying paintings.
  - Each of the four students displays one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: 
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know that:
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed on a different wall than Franz's oil.
  - Greene's oil is displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Franz's watercolor is displayed.
  - Therefore, the wall on which Greene's oil is displayed has Franz's watercolor in the upper position.
  - This means that Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on the remaining wall (since no wall can have only one student's work).
  - Since Hidalgo cannot have both paintings on the same wall as Isaacs (due to the given condition), we know that Hidalgo's paintings are on the same wall as Franz's paintings.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position (since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it).
  - This means that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of wall 4 (since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4).
  Answer: Answer("C") Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
To determine which one of the following must be true, we need to use the given information and make deductions:
- If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
- Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, then Greene's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor.
- Therefore, Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than the one with Franz's oil and Greene's oil.
- Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, then Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
- Therefore, Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on walls 1 and 2.

A: Greene's oil is not necessarily displayed in an upper position.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will display two paintings each (an oil and a watercolor).
  - Two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls of the exhibition room, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then the only possible wall for this to happen is wall 2. This is because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Franz's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of wall 2. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 3. However, since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position. Thus, the answer is C.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, we can deduce that:
  - Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than the one where Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Greene's oil must be displayed on the same wall where Franz's watercolor is displayed.
  - Therefore, Greene's oil is displayed in a lower position.
  
  A: We cannot determine the position of Greene's oil based on the given information.
  B: We cannot determine if Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor based on the given information.
  C: We cannot determine the position of Hidalgo's oil based on the given information.
  D: We cannot determine if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor based on the given information.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students who will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  2. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Reasoning:
  - If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  - Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, then Greene's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor.
  - Therefore, Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than the one where Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, then Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  - Since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, then Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's paintings.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall where Greene's watercolor is displayed.
  - Since no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will display two paintings each (an oil and a watercolor) on four walls (1, 2, 3, and 4).
  - Each wall will have exactly two paintings (one in the upper position and one in the lower position).
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then:
- Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of that wall (because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed).
- Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on that wall (because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it).
- Therefore, the two paintings displayed on that wall must be Hidalgo's paintings (because no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it).
- Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of that wall, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of that wall.
- Therefore, Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
- This means that A, B, and E cannot be true.
- The only remaining option is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then:
- Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than Franz's oil.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than wall 4.
- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so each wall must have at least one oil painting.
- No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, so each wall must have paintings from at least two students.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of that wall.
- Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of that wall, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than Isaacs's watercolor.
- Thus, the only option that must be true is that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  - Each student displays exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings are displayed on each of the four walls.
  - One painting is in the upper position and one in the lower position on each wall.

  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, Greene's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor. Therefore, Greene's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil, which means that Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on the remaining wall. Since Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, it must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position. Thus, the answer is C.

  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
To determine which one of the following must be true, we need to use the given information and make deductions. 

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know that:
- Greene's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil (from the given information).
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4 (from the given information).
- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it (from the given information).
- No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it (from the given information).
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it (from the given information).

Therefore, we can deduce that:
- Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Franz's watercolor is displayed (since each wall has exactly two paintings, and we know the positions of the other paintings on that wall).
- Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on walls 1 and 3 (since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, and Franz, Greene, and Isaacs are already assigned to walls).
- Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor (since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it).

Therefore, the only option that must be true is:
Action: Answer("D") Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.

  - Therefore, we can deduce that:
    - The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on either Monday or Wednesday.
    - The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
    - The first batch of sugar cookies is made on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
  - Since there is only one batch made on Friday, we can eliminate choices A, B, and C because they require more than one batch to be made on Friday.
  - Choice D is also incorrect because the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of sugar cookies is made on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
  - Therefore, the correct answer is E.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Three kinds of cookies are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are a total of 8 batches of cookies made from Monday to Friday.
  - Since three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, there are a total of 9 batches of each kind of cookie made from Monday to Friday.
  - Therefore, one kind of cookie is not made on Friday.
  - The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because one kind of cookie is not made on Friday and there are only three batches of oatmeal cookies made each week.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of peanut butter cookies can be made on Tuesday because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.

Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that two batches of cookies must be made on Thursday.
  - We also know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  - Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, we can eliminate choice A.
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on the same day, so we can eliminate choice B.
  - The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because all three batches of oatmeal cookies must be made by Thursday, so we can eliminate choice C.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on the same day, so we can eliminate choice D.
  - Therefore, the only possible answer is E.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The shopping center has seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the shoe store is in space 4, we know that the businesses in spaces 3 and 5 must not be restaurants (because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses).
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, so the pharmacy cannot be in space 4.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 3 or space 5.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
  - Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6, and the optometrist must be in the other space (either space 6 or space 2).
  - Since the pharmacy cannot be in space 4, it must be in space 1 or space 7.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then a restaurant must be in space 7, and if the pharmacy is in space 7, then a restaurant must be in space 1.
  - Therefore, we have two possible arrangements:
    1. pharmacy (1), optometrist/veterinarian (2/6), veterinarian/optometrist (3/5), shoe store (4), restaurant (7/1), restaurant (1/7), toy store (any remaining space)
    2. restaurant (1/7), optometrist/veterinarian (2/6), veterinarian/optometrist (3/5), shoe store (4), pharmacy (7/1), restaurant (1/7), toy store (any remaining space)
  - In both arrangements, the shoe store is not next to the toy store, so we can eliminate choice D.
  - In both arrangements, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, so we can eliminate choice B.
  - In both arrangements, a restaurant is next to the toy store, so we can eliminate choice C.
  - In arrangement 1, the optometrist is next to a restaurant (in space 6), so choice A is true.
  - In arrangement 2, the optometrist is not next to a restaurant, so choice A is false.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Since the shoe store is in space 4, we can deduce that the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the veterinarian must be in space 3 or 5. If the veterinarian is in space 3, then the pharmacy must be in space 2 and the optometrist in space 1. This would mean that a restaurant would have to be in space 7, which violates the constraint that one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 5, the pharmacy in space 6, and the optometrist in space 7. This means that a restaurant must be in space 1, and the other restaurant must be in space 2 or 3. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the only possibility is that the other restaurant is in space 3. This means that the toy store must be in space 1 or 7, and a restaurant must be next to the toy store. Therefore, the only option that must be true is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian (B).
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Therefore, the restaurant that is not at the end must be in either space 2, 3, 5, or 6.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the optometrist, veterinarian, and toy store must be in spaces 2, 3, 5, and 6.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7, and the optometrist or veterinarian must be in one of the adjacent spaces.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the toy store must be in space 2, 3, 5, or 6, and the veterinarian must be in one of the adjacent spaces.
  - The shoe store is in space 4. Therefore, the optometrist, veterinarian, and toy store must be in spaces 2, 3, 5, and 6, and the restaurant that is not at the end must be in space 6.
  - The only option that is necessarily true is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be next to the shoe store in space 4.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in spaces 1, 2, 6, or 7.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 1 or 7.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 3 or 5.
  - Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7, and one of the restaurants must be in space 6 or 7.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist must be in space 2 and the veterinarian in space 3. This means that one of the restaurants must be in space 6, and the other restaurant must be in space 4 or 5. However, this violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7, and one of the restaurants must be in space 1 or 2.
  - If the restaurant is in space 1, then the optometrist must be in space 2 and the veterinarian in space 3. This means that the other restaurant must be in space 5, and the toy store must be in space 4. In this case, the shoe store is not next to the toy store, so D and E are false.
  - If the restaurant is in space 2, then the optometrist must be in space 1 and the veterinarian in space 3. This means that the other restaurant must be in space 6, and the toy store must be in space 5. In this case, the shoe store is not next to the veterinarian, so E is false.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Since the shoe store is in space 4, we can deduce that the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7. If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2. If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6. In either case, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - Since the shoe store is in space 4, we know that there are two spaces to the left and two spaces to the right of it.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be in space 4.
  - Therefore, the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist must be in space 2 and the veterinarian must be in space 3. If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist must be in space 6 and the veterinarian must be in space 5.
  - Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it cannot be in space 3 if the pharmacy is in space 1, or in space 5 if the pharmacy is in space 7.
  - Therefore, the toy store must be in either space 2 or space 6.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in spaces 1-4 or spaces 4-7.
  - Therefore, the restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 7.
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, the pharmacy must be in space 1 and one of the restaurants must be in space 7.
  - Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 2 if the pharmacy is in space 1, or in space 6 if the pharmacy is in space 7.
  - Since the shoe store is not next to the veterinarian, it must be next to the optometrist if the pharmacy is in space 1, or next to the restaurant if the pharmacy is in space 7.
  - Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian. Answer choice B is correct.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - Since the shoe store is in space 4, we can deduce that the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 1 and 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7.
  - According to the constraints, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist.
  - Therefore, the optometrist must be in either space 2 or space 6.
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, they cannot be in spaces 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Therefore, one of the restaurants must be in space 1 or space 7.
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, the restaurant must be in the space opposite to the pharmacy. Therefore, the restaurant must be in space 7 if the pharmacy is in space 1, or in space 1 if the pharmacy is in space 7.
  - Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it must be in either space 3 or space 5.
  - Therefore, the only option that must be true is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, which is true if the pharmacy is in space 1.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - Since the shoe store is in space 4, we know that the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and it cannot be next to the restaurant at the other end of the row. 
  - The only way for the pharmacy to be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian is if the pharmacy is in space 2 or 6. 
  - If the pharmacy is in space 2, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 1 or 3, which means that a restaurant must be in space 4 or 5. However, this violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 6, and the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 7. 
  - Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it must be in space 5. 
  - Therefore, the businesses are arranged in the following order: pharmacy, optometrist or veterinarian, restaurant, restaurant, shoe store, toy store, veterinarian or optometrist. 
  - This means that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, so the answer is B.
Response 8:
Knowledge:

  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7, and one of the restaurants must be in the other space.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the optometrist, the veterinarian, or the toy store must be between the two restaurants.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, if the pharmacy is in space 1, the optometrist must be in space 2 and the veterinarian must be in space 3. If the pharmacy is in space 7, the optometrist must be in space 6 and the veterinarian must be in space 5.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, if the veterinarian is in space 3, the toy store must be in space 5. If the veterinarian is in space 5, the toy store must be in space 3.
  - The shoe store is in space 4. Therefore, the optometrist, the veterinarian, and the toy store cannot be in spaces 3, 4, and 5.
  - The only option left is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, which is true for both possible locations of the pharmacy (spaces 1 and 7). Therefore, Answer("B") is correct.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.

  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  Exactly two of the rugs are solid.
  
Analysis:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each solid rug must be woven in a single color. 
  There are five colors available to weave the rugs, so exactly three colors will be used in the multicolored rug.
  We need to find a pair of colors that cannot be used in a solid rug.
  If forest is used in a solid rug, then none of the other colors can be used in the other solid rug because forest cannot be used with any other color.
  If peach is used in a solid rug, then olive must be used in the other solid rug. Therefore, yellow cannot be used in the other solid rug because peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.
  If turquoise is used in a solid rug, then none of the other colors can be used in the other solid rug because turquoise cannot be used with any other color.
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be forest and any other color, peach and yellow, or turquoise and any other color.

  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  There are exactly two solid rugs.

  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be three multicolored rugs.
  If white is used in a solid rug, then two other colors are also used. Therefore, white cannot be used in a solid rug.
  If olive is used in a solid rug, then peach must also be used. Therefore, olive cannot be used in a solid rug.
  Therefore, the two solid rugs must be woven from the remaining four colors: forest, peach, turquoise, and yellow.
  Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot be used in the same solid rug.
  Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot be used in the same solid rug.
  Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot be used in the same solid rug.
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be forest and peach (choice A), forest and yellow (choice B), or peach and yellow (choice D).

Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: Verma could be the project leader if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The project leader must be one of the three selected project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Verma must be one of the three selected project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  Therefore, the three selected project members are Smith, Taylor, and Verma, with Verma as the project leader.
  The only choice that satisfies this condition is C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  
Action: Answer("C")

  The project will have 3 members and 1 leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then she must be one of the three project members. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Verma cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if Smith is a project member.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if Quinn or Ruiz is a project member.
  Therefore, Verma can only be the project leader if Smith, Quinn, Ruiz, and Wells are not project members.

  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, neither Smith nor Taylor can be selected as project members.
  If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma could be the project leader. Therefore, the answer is (C).

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The project leader must be one of the three project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.

  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader. Therefore, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member.
  Therefore, the three project members are Smith, Taylor, and Verma, and Verma is the project leader.
  The only choice that allows for Smith, Taylor, and Verma to be the three project members is C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. 
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member. 
  Therefore, the possible combinations of project members are:
  1. Smith, Taylor, Verma
  2. Smith, Taylor, Wells
  3. Smith, Wells, Quinn
  4. Smith, Wells, Xue
  5. Taylor, Wells, Quinn
  6. Taylor, Wells, Xue

  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be project members. This is because Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. So, if Verma is the project leader, then the other two members must be selected from Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue. 
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. So, if Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected. 
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. So, if Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  Therefore, the only possible combination of project members if Verma is the project leader is Smith, Taylor, and Xue.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Elimination:
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, if Smith is not selected, Taylor cannot be the project leader.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, Wells cannot be a project member.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Wells cannot be a project member. Therefore, Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member and the other one must be the project leader. Also, since Smith must be a project member if Taylor is, and Verma cannot be a project member if Wells is, the third project member must be either Smith or Taylor.
  
Testing:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. - This means that Ruiz is selected as the project leader and project member, but Smith must be a project member if Taylor is, so this option is not possible.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected. - This means that Quinn is the project leader and project member, but Smith must be a project member if Taylor is, so this option is not possible.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected. - This means that Verma is the project leader, Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, and the third project member is Wells. This option is possible.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected. - This means that Verma is the project leader, Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, and the third project member is Wells. This option is possible.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected. - This means that Quinn or Ruiz is the project leader and project member, but Smith must be a project member if Taylor is, so this option is not possible.

Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then she must be one of the three selected project members. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  Therefore, the three selected project members must be Smith, Taylor, and one of Quinn, Ruiz, or Xue.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader.
  Therefore, Xue must be the project leader if Verma is a project member.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.

  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader. Therefore, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be project members.
  Therefore, the only remaining workers who can be project members are Xue and Verma.
  If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then Verma must be a project member. Therefore, Verma could be the project leader if neither Smith nor Xue is selected.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
  A: We cannot determine if this is true or false based on the given information.
  B: We cannot determine if this is true or false based on the given information.
  C: We cannot determine if this is true or false based on the given information.
  D: We cannot determine if this is true or false based on the given information.
  E: We cannot determine if this is true or false based on the given information.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that Jaramillo can only be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, which would also mean that Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship. However, we do not know if Landon or Ong are assigned to any ambassadorship, so options B, C, and E cannot be concluded. Option A is not necessarily true because Jaramillo could be assigned to Yemen instead of Venezuela. Therefore, the only option that must be true is that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, making option D the correct answer.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that Jaramillo can not be assigned as ambassador to any country, because if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships, which is not possible because Kayne is already assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, and the correct answer is D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it must be to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship. If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship. However, if Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned to an ambassadorship if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Thus, Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, which means that the answer is D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
  A: We cannot conclude this from the given information.
  B: We cannot conclude this from the given information.
  C: We cannot conclude this from the given information.
  D: We cannot conclude this from the given information.
  E: We cannot conclude this from the given information.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. Therefore, if Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then there would be only two ambassadors (Landon and Ong) for three countries (Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia), which is not possible. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned to an ambassadorship. According to the constraints, if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship. However, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. Therefore, the only option left for Ong is to be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. This means that Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship, and so Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. Therefore, Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship. Answer D is correct.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any of the ambassadorships. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any of the ambassadorships. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned to one of the other two ambassadorships (Venezuela or Zambia). However, if Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen because of the constraint that if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned to Zambia, which means that Landon is not assigned to any ambassadorship. Thus, the only option that must be true is that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong is not assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("A")

  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
  A: There is no information that links Jaramillo to Venezuela if Kayne is assigned to Yemen.
  B: There is no information that links Landon to Zambia if Kayne is assigned to Yemen.
  C: There is no information that links Ong to Zambia if Kayne is assigned to Yemen.
  D: There is no information that links Jaramillo to not being assigned to an ambassadorship if Kayne is assigned to Yemen.
  E: There is no information that links Ong to not being assigned to an ambassadorship if Kayne is assigned to Yemen.

The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band, and each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  We are asked to identify the member who CANNOT perform the third solo.
  
Analysis:
  We know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  We know that the percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, so the percussionist must perform either the first or second solo.
  We know that the keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo.
  We know that the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform either the second, third, fourth, or fifth solo.
  We are asked to identify the member who CANNOT perform the third solo. Therefore, we need to find which members can perform the third solo and eliminate them.
  
Solution:
  The guitarist can perform the first or second solo, but not the third.
  The percussionist can perform the first or second solo, but not the third.
  The keyboard player can perform the second solo, but not the third.
  The saxophonist can perform the second, fourth, or fifth solo, but not the third.
  The violinist can perform the first solo.
  Therefore, the member who CANNOT perform the third solo is the saxophonist.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist, because the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the keyboard player, because the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the saxophonist, because the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo, because the percussionist or the trumpeter must perform before the saxophonist does.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the trumpeter, because the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform before the trumpeter does.
  - The third solo can be performed by the violinist, because the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are six solos performed by six members of a band.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: 
  The third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist (due to the first restriction) or the percussionist (due to the second restriction). 
  The third solo cannot be performed by the saxophonist (due to the fourth restriction). 
  The third solo cannot be performed by the violinist (due to the third restriction). 
  The only option left is the keyboard player. 
  Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To determine who performs the third solo, we can use the following logic:
  - The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, so they must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so they must perform either the first or second solo.
  - The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, so they must perform either the second or third solo.
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both, so they must perform either the second, third, fourth, or fifth solo.
  - The trumpeter must perform either the first, second, or fifth solo.
  - The violinist must perform either the first, second, or fourth solo.

If we combine all of these restrictions, we can create a table to keep track of which solos each member can perform:

| Member        | Possible Solos |
|---------------|----------------|
| Guitarist     | 1, 2           |
| Keyboard      | 2, 3           |
| Percussionist | 1, 2           |
| Saxophonist   | 2, 3, 4, 5     |
| Trumpeter     | 1, 2, 5        |
| Violinist     | 1, 2, 4        |

The only member who cannot perform the third solo is the violinist, as they can only perform the first, second, or fourth solo.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are six solos performed by six members of the band.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  The third solo can be performed by either the saxophonist, the trumpeter, or the violinist. 
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, if the saxophonist performs the third solo, then either the percussionist or the trumpeter must perform the second solo. However, the question states that the third solo cannot be performed by that member, which means that the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo. 
  Therefore, the answer is C: saxophonist.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are six solos in total, each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  The third solo must be performed after the percussionist and before the guitarist. 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist could perform the third solo if the percussionist performed the first solo and the trumpeter performed the second solo.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist. Therefore, the keyboard player could perform the third solo if the violinist performed the first solo and the guitarist performed the second solo.
  The trumpeter and the violinist have no restrictions on when they can perform their solos.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
Therefore, the guitarist cannot perform the third solo.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist, because the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the keyboard player, because the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the saxophonist, because the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo, because the percussionist or the trumpeter must perform before the saxophonist does.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the trumpeter, because the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform before the trumpeter does.
  - The third solo can be performed by the violinist, because the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are six solos performed by six different band members.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  We are asked to identify the band member who CANNOT perform the third solo.
  
Elimination:
  We know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist cannot perform the third solo either.
  The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so the percussionist cannot perform the third solo.
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, so the keyboard player cannot perform the third solo.
  The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both, so the saxophonist can perform the third solo.
  The violinist is not restricted in any way, so the violinist can perform the third solo.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are six solos, one for each member of the band.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  Since there are six solos, and the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, we can assume that the guitarist performs either the first, second, or third solo. 
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, so the keyboard player cannot perform the first solo.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does, so the keyboard player cannot perform the sixth solo.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the fifth solo, because the percussionist and the trumpeter have already performed their solos.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are six solos performed by six different band members.

  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  We need to determine which band member cannot perform the third solo.
  
Analysis:
  Let's analyze the restrictions one by one:
  1. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. This means that the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  2. The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does. This means that the percussionist must perform either the first or second solo.
  3. The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. This means that the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo.
  4. The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. This means that the saxophonist must perform either the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.
  
  From the above analysis, we can conclude that the violinist must perform the first solo.
  Now, let's consider each option:
  A: The guitarist can perform the first or second solo, but not the third. This option is possible.
  B: The keyboard player can perform the second solo, but not the third. This option is possible.
  C: The saxophonist can perform the fourth, fifth, or sixth solo, but not the third. This option is possible.
  D: The trumpeter can perform the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo. This option is possible.
  E: The violinist must perform the first solo. This option is not possible because the question asks for the band member who cannot perform the third solo.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) will have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes. Since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and Gagnon already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Gagnon must also have a photograph in the Metro section. This means that Gagnon has at least two photographs in total, so none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Answer: B.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) must have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. This is because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since Gagnon and Hue have already been assigned to the Lifestyle section, Fuentes must be assigned to the Metro section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. This means that B is the correct answer. None of the other options are necessarily true based on the given information.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) will have two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
- The remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
- At least one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes.
- Since Gagnon already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Metro section.
- Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
- The remaining photograph in the Metro section is by Hue or Fuentes.
- Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and there is already one photograph by Hue in the Lifestyle section, there must be one photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section.
- Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Fuentes.
- The remaining photograph in the Sports section is by Hue or Gagnon.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) will have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
  - There must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes.
  - There must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by Gagnon or Hue.
  - There must be at least one photograph in the Sports section by Fuentes or Hue.
  
  A: It is not necessarily true. There could be zero or two photographs in the Metro section by Fuentes.
  B: It is not necessarily true. There could be zero or two photographs in the Metro section by Gagnon.
  C: It is not necessarily true. There could be zero or two photographs in the Metro section by Gagnon.
  D: It must be true. If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there must be one photograph in the Sports section by Hue (because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section).
  E: It is not necessarily true. There could be zero or two photographs in the Sports section by Hue.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section to satisfy the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and there are only two photographers left (Fuentes and Hue) who can have photographs in the Sports section, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Answer: B.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then we know that the other photograph in the Metro section must be taken by Fuentes, because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes, which means that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Hence, the answer is B.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) will have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section to satisfy the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, it follows that Fuentes must have exactly one photograph in the Metro section and exactly one photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Thus, the answer is B.

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section to satisfy the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and Hue has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must have a photograph in the Sports section to satisfy the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) will have two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
- The remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
- The photograph in the Metro section that is by the same photographer as the Gagnon photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
- The photograph in the Metro section that is by the same photographer as the Hue photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
- The remaining photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) will have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then we know that the remaining photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes, since there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. This means that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes, so (A) is not necessarily true. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, (C) and (E) are not true. Finally, we know that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, so if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon, so (B) is true. (D) is not necessarily true because there could be more than one photograph in the Sports section by Hue.

Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Action: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday. This is because the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday, and it cannot be made on Monday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on that day. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday. Since each kind of cookie has three batches, this means that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - There are three batches of each type of cookie, one batch per day from Monday to Friday.
  - No two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - We know that if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the remaining batches must be made on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  
Analysis:
  - Since there are three batches of each type of cookie, and we know that no two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day, then there must be exactly one batch of each type of cookie made on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  - Therefore, we can eliminate options A and B, which suggest that there are more than three batches of cookies made on Tuesday or Friday.
  - Option C suggests that there are at least two batches of cookies made on Monday, which is not necessarily true. We only know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - Option D suggests that there are at least two batches of cookies made on Thursday, which is also not necessarily true. We only know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - Option E is not necessarily true either, as we don't know how many batches of cookies are made on Monday and Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:

  - If scenario 1 is true, then there are only two possible scenarios for Thursday:
    1. Two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
    2. Three batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  - If scenario 1 is true, then there are only two possible scenarios for Friday:
    1. Two batches of cookies are made on Friday.
    2. Three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

  If scenario 2 is true, then:
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is not made on Wednesday.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, which means that the first batch of sugar cookies is not made on Wednesday.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, which means that there are only two possible scenarios for Monday:
    1. One batch of cookies is made on Monday.
    2. Two or three batches of cookies are made on Monday.

    2. Three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  - If scenario 2 is true, then there are only two possible scenarios for Thursday:
    1. Two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
    2. Three batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  - If scenario 2 is true, then there are only two possible scenarios for Friday:
    1. Two batches of cookies are made on Friday.
    2. Three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are two possibilities:
    1. All three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
    2. Two batches of cookies are made on Monday, and one batch is made on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  - If possibility 1 is true, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, and exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  - If possibility 2 is true, then at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday, and no more than one batch of cookies is made on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  - Therefore, the only option that must be true is:
  
Action: Answer("B") 
  - Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - There are three batches of each type of cookie made each week.
  - Each batch is made on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible scenarios for Wednesday: no batches are made on Wednesday, or all three batches are made on Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  - If all three batches are made on Wednesday, then no batches of oatmeal or peanut butter cookies can be made on Wednesday, which means the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. This leaves only one batch of sugar cookies to be made on Thursday, which means no batches can be made on Friday. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and no batches are made on Thursday or Friday. This eliminates choices A, B, D, and E.
  - If no batches are made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. This leaves only one batch of sugar cookies to be made on Thursday, which means the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday. Therefore, exactly two batches of cookies are made on Friday, and at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday. This means that choice C must be true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday or Thursday. However, the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday. This means that the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday, leaving only the third batch of each kind of cookie to be made on Friday. Thus, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible scenarios for Wednesday: either one batch of cookies is made, or no batches of cookies are made.
  - If one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there would be two batches of cookies made on some other day, which would violate the rule that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - Therefore, no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, which means that there are two batches of cookies made on some other day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so those two batches must be made on the same day.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so there can be no other batches of cookies made on Thursday.
  - Therefore, the two batches of cookies made on some other day must be oatmeal and sugar cookies, and they must be made on Tuesday and Friday (in some order).
  - This means that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday and Friday, so the answer is A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Three batches of each type of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are at most two batches of cookies made on Tuesday and Thursday combined.
  
Analysis:
  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are at most two batches of cookies made on Tuesday and Thursday combined. This means that there must be at least one day (either Tuesday or Thursday) on which only one batch of cookies is made.
  - Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, it cannot be the case that only one batch of cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, only one batch of cookies can be made on Tuesday.
  - Since no two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day, the batch made on Tuesday must be a type of cookie that has not been made yet. This means that the batches made on Monday must be oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar (in some order).
  - Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the batch made on Tuesday cannot be oatmeal or peanut butter, it must be sugar.
  - This leaves only one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies to be made, which must be made on Friday.
  
Action: Answer("B") - Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

One team will have two members, and the other will have three members. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator. The assignment must satisfy the following conditions: Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Kelly is not a facilitator. Olga is a facilitator.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
  B: Lateefah is a facilitator.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 5 students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  - There are 2 teams: green team and red team.
  - One team has 2 members and the other team has 3 members.
  - One member of each team will be designated as a facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Analysis:
  - Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have 2 or 3 members. Therefore, the red team must have 3 or 2 members, respectively.
  - Since Olga is a facilitator, she must be on a team with either 2 or 3 members. Therefore, the team with Olga must be the green team.
  - Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, Juana must be on the red team.
  - Since Kelly is not a facilitator, she cannot be on the same team as Olga. Therefore, Kelly must be on the red team.
  - Since Mei is the only student left, she must be on the green team.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members, and the red team must have two members. 
  Olga is a facilitator, and since she is on the green team, the other facilitator must be on the red team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so Juana must be on the red team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Kelly must be on the green team.
  Mei is the only student left, so she must be on the red team.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  There are two teams: the green team and the red team.
  One team has two members, and the other has three members.
  One member of each team is a facilitator.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Since Olga is a facilitator, she cannot be on the same team as Kelly. Therefore, Kelly must be on the red team. Since Lateefah is on the green team, the green team has three members, and the red team has two members. Since Juana is not on the same team as Olga, Juana must be on the red team. Therefore, Mei is on the green team. Since Kelly is not a facilitator, Olga must be the facilitator on the red team. Therefore, Mei and Lateefah are the facilitators on the green team. Thus, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are two teams, green and red, with different number of members and one facilitator each.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: Since Olga is a facilitator and Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, Juana cannot be a facilitator. Therefore, Mei must be the other facilitator. Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members, including Lateefah and Olga. Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the red team, which has two members. Thus, Olga is assigned to the green team. Therefore, C is the correct answer.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams, one with two members and the other with three members.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members and the red team must have two members. 
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the red team.
  Mei is the only student left and must be assigned to the green team.
  Therefore, Lateefah and Mei are facilitators, and Juana and Kelly are not facilitators.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:

  One member of each team is designated as facilitator.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Since Olga is a facilitator, she must be on one of the teams. Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, Olga must be assigned to the red team. Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the green team. Since Kelly is not a facilitator, Mei must be the other facilitator. Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators, and the answer is D.

  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Since Olga is a facilitator, she cannot be on the same team as Lateefah. Therefore, Olga must be on the red team, and Juana must be on the green team. Since Mei is the only student left, she must be on the red team with Olga. Therefore, Juana and Kelly are on the green team. Since Kelly is not a facilitator, Lateefah must be the facilitator for the green team. Therefore, Juana and Mei are the facilitators for the red team, and Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  There are two teams: the green team and the red team.
  One team has two members, and the other team has three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Since Olga is a facilitator, she must be on one of the teams. Lateefah is assigned to the green team, which means the team with two members is the red team. Therefore, Olga is on the red team with Juana and Mei. Since Olga is a facilitator, Mei cannot be a facilitator. Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  - There are two teams: green team and red team.
  - One team has two members, and the other has three members.
  - One member of each team is a facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Analysis:
  - Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members and the red team must have two members.
  - Since Olga is a facilitator, she must be on the green team.
  - Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, Juana must be on the red team.
  - Since Kelly is not a facilitator, Mei must be the facilitator on the red team.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members, and the red team must have two members.
  Olga is a facilitator, and she is assigned to the team with two members, which is the red team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so Juana must be assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Mei must be the other facilitator.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Analysis:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, so it cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, and it cannot trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp must trade one of its class 2 buildings for another class 2 building. The only other company that owns a class 2 building is Southco, so Trustcorp must trade with Southco. After the trade, Trustcorp will own only class 1 and class 3 buildings, and Southco will own only class 1 and class 3 buildings. RealProp will still own a class 1 building. Therefore, A, B, D, and E are not necessarily true. The only statement that must be true is that Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
  A: It is not clear whether RealProp owns a class 1 building or not. The information given does not allow us to determine this.
  B: Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Therefore, Southco does not own only class 2 buildings. This option is not true.
  C: It is not clear whether Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp or not. The information given does not allow us to determine this.
  D: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, not Trustcorp. Therefore, Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower. This option is not true.
  E: The Zimmer House is owned by RealProp, not Trustcorp. Therefore, Trustcorp does not own the Zimmer House. This option is not true.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns 3 buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns 2 buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  Therefore, Southco cannot have traded a class 2 building with Trustcorp, because if it did, Trustcorp would still own at least one class 2 building. 
  So, C is not true.
  A is not necessarily true, because RealProp could have traded a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, and therefore not own any class 1 buildings.
  B is not necessarily true, because Southco could have traded a class 2 building with RealProp or with another company.
  D is not true, because RealProp owns the Garza Tower, not Trustcorp.
  E is not necessarily true, because RealProp could have traded the Zimmer House with Trustcorp for two class 3 buildings, and therefore Trustcorp would not own the Zimmer House.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is one of the three kinds of trades.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means that Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings. 
  The only way for Trustcorp to trade all of its class 2 buildings is to trade each of them for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have made at least two trades with either RealProp or Southco, since they are the only ones who own class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp has made at least two trades with RealProp, then RealProp must own at least two class 3 buildings, which means that RealProp must own the Yates House and the Zimmer House. Therefore, RealProp cannot own a class 1 building, and option A is false.
  If Trustcorp has made at least two trades with Southco, then Southco must own at least two class 2 buildings, which means that Southco cannot own only class 2 buildings, and option B is false.
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means that Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building, which are both class 2 buildings. Trustcorp must have received either one class 1 building or two class 3 buildings in exchange for each of the traded class 2 buildings. Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it must have received a class 1 building in exchange for each of the traded class 2 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp must have received two class 1 buildings in exchange for the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building. The only class 1 building that is available for trade is the Garza Tower, which is owned by RealProp. Therefore, RealProp must have traded the Garza Tower to Trustcorp in exchange for the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building. Since RealProp owns a class 1 building, Southco must own only class 2 buildings. Southco cannot have made any trades with Trustcorp because Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, which cannot be traded for class 2 buildings. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Analysis:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, so it cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for one or two class 2 buildings or a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for one or two class 2 buildings, it will still own at least one class 2 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it must trade the King Building or the Meyer Building for the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  After this trade, Southco will own only class 2 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, the Garza Tower, and two class 3 buildings, the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings.
  After this trade, RealProp will own a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has not traded with Trustcorp.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Analysis:
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. Therefore, it can only trade a class 2 building for one class 1 building or one class 2 building. If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for a class 1 building, then RealProp must own the class 1 building that Trustcorp trades for. Therefore, A is true. If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for another class 2 building, then Southco must own the class 2 building that Trustcorp trades for. Therefore, Southco does not own only class 2 buildings, so B is false. Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 2 buildings. Therefore, C is false. Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower, so D is false. Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building, so E is false.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Analysis:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, so it cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp can only trade a class 2 building for one other building of the same class or a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for one other building of the same class, it will still own only class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, it will own only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp cannot own a class 1 building after some number of trades.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, so (A) is possible.
  Southco owns a class 1 building, so (B) is not true.
  There is no information about whether Southco has made a trade with Trustcorp, so (C) is not necessarily true.
  There is no information about whether Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower, so (D) is not necessarily true.
  RealProp owns the Zimmer House, so (E) is not true.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.

    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
  A: It is not necessary that RealProp owns a class 1 building. RealProp may have traded its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings.
  B: Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building. It is not necessary that Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: It is not necessary that Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp. Southco may have traded with RealProp or another company.

    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means that Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. This also means that Southco has not traded its class 2 building with Trustcorp, because if it had, Trustcorp would still own at least one class 2 building. Therefore, Southco has only traded with RealProp. Since RealProp owns only one class 1 building, it means that Southco has traded its class 2 building for two class 3 buildings owned by RealProp. This also means that RealProp owns two class 3 buildings and no class 2 buildings.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are six slots numbered one through six.
  - There are six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots two and three, in some order.
  
Analysis:
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots two and three, in some order.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so it cannot be in slot six.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it cannot be in slot one or two.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so it cannot be in slot five or six.
  - Therefore, the only possible slot for Uneasy is slot four.
  - If Uneasy is in slot four, then Yardsign must be in slot one or two.
  - If Yardsign is in slot one, then Vegemite must be in slot two, which is not possible because Zircon must be in slot three.

  - Therefore, Wellspring performs in slot three and Xpert performs in slot four.
  - Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign performs in slot one or slot two.
  - If Yardsign performs in slot one, then Vegemite must perform in slot two, which is not possible because Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot two and Vegemite performs in slot three.
  - Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy performs in slot four, slot five, or slot six.
  - If Uneasy performs in slot four, then Zircon must perform in slot three, which is not possible because Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - If Uneasy performs in slot six, then Zircon must perform in slot five, which is not possible because Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.

  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots two and three in some order.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign must perform in slot one.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite must perform in slot two or slot three.
  - If Vegemite performs in slot two, then Zircon must perform in slot three, which is not possible because Wellspring must perform in slot two. Therefore, Vegemite must perform in slot three, and Zircon must perform in slot two.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must perform in slot four, slot five, or slot six.
  - If Uneasy performs in slot four, then Xpert must perform in slot five, which is not possible because Wellspring must perform in slot two. Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot four.
  - If Uneasy performs in slot six, then Xpert must perform in slot five, which is not possible because Wellspring must perform in slot two. Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot six.
  - Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot five.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.

We know that Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert. So, we can infer that Xpert will perform in slot 6. Therefore, Zircon must perform in slot 4 or 5. According to constraint 2, Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Xpert. So, Zircon performs in slot 4. According to constraint 1, Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. So, Vegemite performs in slot 3. According to constraint 4, Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. So, Yardsign performs in slot 1 or 2. According to constraint 3, Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. So, Uneasy performs in slot 4, 5, or 6. 

Option A violates constraint 3 because Uneasy cannot perform in slot 5. Option B violates constraint 1 because Vegemite cannot perform in slot 3. Option C violates the given information that Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert. Option D violates constraint 2 because Zircon cannot perform in slot 2. Therefore, the correct answer is E because Zircon can perform in slot 4.

Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be

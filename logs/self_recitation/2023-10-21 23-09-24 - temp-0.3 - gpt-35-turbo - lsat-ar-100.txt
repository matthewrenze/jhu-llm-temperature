### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three students review Undulation.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  - If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the two students who review Tamerlane are Kramer and O'Neill.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must review either Tamerlane or Sunset.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, so one of the following must be true:
    - Kramer and Megregian review the same play or plays.
    - Lopez and Megregian review the same play or plays.
    - O'Neill and Megregian review the same play or plays.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then Megregian must review Sunset. This means that O'Neill does not review Undulation, so the correct answer is B.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  - Three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Each student reviews one or more of the three plays.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the two remaining students must review the same play or plays as each other. 
  A: If Megregian does not review Undulation, then the two remaining students must review the same play or plays as each other. This would mean that there are at least three students reviewing the same play or plays, which is not possible.
  B: If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then the two remaining students must review the same play or plays as each other. This is possible, as long as the two students who review the same play or plays do not review Tamerlane.
  C: If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation. This means that the two remaining students must review the same play or plays as each other. This is possible, as long as the two students who review the same play or plays do not review Tamerlane.
  D: If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Kramer and O'Neill must review the same play or plays as each other. This means that Megregian must review Undulation, and Jiang cannot review any of the plays reviewed by Megregian. This is not possible, as there would be more than two students reviewing the same play or plays.
  E: If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer and O'Neill must review the same play or plays as each other. This means that Megregian must review Undulation, and neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Tamerlane. This is possible.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three students review Undulation.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  A: We don't know if Megregian reviews Undulation or not.
  B: We don't know if O'Neill reviews Undulation or not.
  C: If exactly three students review Undulation, and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, then Jiang cannot review Undulation. Therefore, this statement is false.
  D: We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so it is not possible for Lopez to review Tamerlane. Therefore, this statement is false.
  E: We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so it is not possible for O'Neill to review Sunset. Therefore, this statement is false.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  5 students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  3 plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez < Megregian.
  Lopez and Megregian do not review any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  
  A: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. So, Megregian must review Tamerlane. This means Megregian does not review Undulation. Therefore, A is true.
  B: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. We know that O'Neill reviews Tamerlane. Therefore, B is false.
  C: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane. So, C is true.
  D: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, Lopez cannot review Tamerlane. So, D is false.
  E: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, O'Neill cannot review Sunset. So, E is false.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  5 students review 1 or more of 3 plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Solution:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer of the plays than Megregian. If Megregian reviews Undulation, then Kramer and Lopez cannot review Undulation. Therefore, Megregian does not review Undulation. This eliminates option A.
  If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then he must review Sunset. However, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, which contradicts this option. Therefore, O'Neill reviews Undulation. This eliminates option B.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews. If Jiang reviews Undulation, then Lopez and Megregian cannot review Undulation. Therefore, Jiang does not review Undulation. This eliminates option C.
  If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian cannot review Tamerlane. This contradicts the statement that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, Lopez does not review Tamerlane. This eliminates option D.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Five students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review one or more of exactly three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the two students who review the same play or plays must not have reviewed Undulation. This means that the two students who reviewed Tamerlane must not have reviewed Undulation. Therefore, the student who did not review Undulation must have reviewed either Sunset or Tamerlane. 

A: Megregian does not review Undulation. This cannot be true because we know that exactly three students review Undulation, so Megregian must be one of them.
B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. This could be true because we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot both review Undulation.
C: Jiang reviews Undulation. This cannot be true because we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and we already established that Megregian reviews Undulation.
D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. This cannot be true because we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. This could be true because we established that O'Neill did not review Undulation, so he must have reviewed either Sunset or Tamerlane.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three students review Undulation.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Analysis:
  - If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane and Sunset.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the other student who reviews Tamerlane must be one of the students who does not review Undulation.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must review Sunset.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, so either Kramer and O'Neill review the same play as each other, or one of them reviews the same play as Lopez or Megregian.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane and Sunset. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot review Undulation. Therefore, O'Neill does not review Undulation.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  5 students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review 1 or more of 3 plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, either Kramer or Lopez must review Tamerlane.
  
A: If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. Therefore, Megregian must review Undulation. This means that Megregian cannot review any other play, so A is false.
B: If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so B is true.
C: If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation. Therefore, C is false.
D: If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so D is false.
E: If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so E is false.

  - Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane, so the third student who reviewed Undulation cannot be Kramer or O'Neill.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviewed any play Jiang reviewed, so Jiang cannot be the student who reviewed Undulation.
  - If Megregian reviewed Undulation, then the other two plays he reviewed must be Tamerlane and Sunset. This means that Kramer and O'Neill must have reviewed the same play or plays as each other, which contradicts the given condition that exactly two students reviewed the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, Megregian did not review Undulation.
  
Action: Answer("B") - O'Neill does not review Undulation.

  A: If Megregian does not review Undulation, then the three students who review Undulation cannot be Megregian, Kramer, and O'Neill. This contradicts the given condition that exactly three students review Undulation.
  B: If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then the three students who review Undulation cannot be Jiang, Lopez, and O'Neill. This contradicts the given condition that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  C: If Jiang reviews Undulation, then the three students who review Undulation cannot include Lopez or Megregian. This contradicts the given condition that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  D: If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then the three students who review Undulation cannot include Lopez or Megregian. This contradicts the given condition that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  E: If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then the three students who review Undulation cannot include O'Neill. This contradicts the given condition that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.

Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building

  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  - RealProp has a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings. It can trade the class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or trade one of the class 3 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  - Southco has a class 1 building and a class 2 building. It can trade the class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  - Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings. It can trade one of the class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.

  - RealProp trades Garza Tower (class 1) for Flores Tower (class 1) and keeps Yates House (class 3) and Zimmer House (class 3).
  - Southco trades Lynch Building (class 2) for King Building (class 2) and Ortiz Building (class 2) and keeps Flores Tower (class 1).
  - Trustcorp trades Meyer Building (class 2) for Yates House (class 3) and Zimmer House (class 3) and keeps King Building (class 2) and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  - This option is not valid because RealProp cannot trade Garza Tower (class 1) for Flores Tower (class 1).

Option B: 
  - RealProp trades Yates House (class 3) for King Building (class 2) and Ortiz Building (class 2) and keeps Garza Tower (class 1) and Zimmer House (class 3).
  - Southco trades Lynch Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings and keeps Flores Tower (class 1).
  - Trustcorp trades Meyer Building (class 2) for Yates House (class 3) and Zimmer House (class 3) and keeps King Building (class 2) and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  - This option is not valid because RealProp cannot trade Yates House (class 3) for two class 2 buildings.

Option C: 
  - RealProp trades Garza Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings and keeps Yates House (class 3) and Zimmer House (class 3).
  - Southco trades Lynch Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings and keeps Flores Tower (class 1).

  - This option is valid.

Option D: 
  - RealProp trades Yates House (class 3) for two class 3 buildings and keeps Garza Tower (class 1) and Zimmer House (class 3).

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns 3 buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns 2 buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  There are three types of trades that can be made: trading one building for one other building of the same class, trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  To make only one trade, the companies must exchange one building of one class for one or two buildings of the same class or a different class. 
  RealProp has a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings, so it can only trade the Garza Tower with a class 1 building or trade one of its class 3 buildings with two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings. 
  Southco has a class 1 building and a class 2 building, so it can only trade the Flores Tower with a class 1 building or trade the Lynch Building with two class 3 buildings. 
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings, so it can trade any of them with two class 3 buildings or trade two of them with a class 1 building and a class 3 building.

Solution:
  RealProp can trade the Garza Tower with the Flores Tower or trade the Yates House or Zimmer House with two of Trustcorp's class 2 buildings. 
  Southco can trade the Flores Tower with the Garza Tower or trade the Lynch Building with two of RealProp's class 3 buildings. 
  Trustcorp can trade any of its class 2 buildings with two of RealProp's class 3 buildings or trade two of them with the Garza Tower and one of RealProp's class 3 buildings. 
  Therefore, the only option that matches these conditions is:
  RealProp: the Garza Tower and two of Trustcorp's class 2 buildings
  Southco: the Flores Tower and Lynch Building
  Trustcorp: the King Building, Meyer Building, Ortiz Building, and one of RealProp's class 3 buildings

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then:
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
- U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
- W must be mentioned after T, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. So, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, and W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7.

Using these constraints, we can eliminate some of the answer choices:
- A: R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 if U is mentioned in chapter 3, because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and T must be mentioned before W.
- C: S cannot be mentioned in chapter 7 if U is mentioned in chapter 3, because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7.
- D: W cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 if U is mentioned in chapter 3, because W must be mentioned after T, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.

Therefore, the possible answer choices are:
B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 1, 3, 5, or 7, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 2, 4, or 6.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5, and X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, if U is mentioned in chapter 3, then W could be mentioned in chapter 6.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

To determine which option could be true if U is mentioned in chapter 3, we can use the following deductions:
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7, and W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, X cannot be mentioned in chapter 5 or 7.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.

Using these deductions, we can eliminate options A and C, since they mention R and S, respectively, in chapters that are not possible based on the constraints. We can also eliminate option E, since X cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 if U is mentioned in chapter 3. This leaves us with options B and D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z must be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, E is the only possible answer choice.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: 
If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4. 
If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 7. 
If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 7. 
Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or 5, and S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6. 
If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 7. 
If X is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6. 
Therefore, Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7. 
Thus, the only possible option is D: W is mentioned in chapter 6. Answer("D")

  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be in chapter 4 or 5.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4. T cannot be in chapter 6 or 7, so it must be in chapter 2, 3, 4, or 5. If T is in chapter 2, then S cannot be in chapter 3, so S must be in chapter 5. If T is in chapter 3, then S cannot be in chapter 2 or 4, so S must be in chapter 5 or 7. If T is in chapter 4, then S cannot be in chapter 5, so S must be in chapter 7. If T is in chapter 5, then S must be in chapter 2. In all cases, R can be in chapter 5. Therefore, the answer is B.

This means that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7, because there would not be enough chapters to satisfy this constraint. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. This means that S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 6 and 7, because those are the only two chapters left.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. This means that W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, because X must be mentioned in chapter 4 if U is mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5, 6, or 7.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, W could be mentioned in chapter 6.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
Using condition 4, we know that only two students can review the same play or plays as each other. 
Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane. 

So, the only possible pairs of students who can review the same play are:
- Kramer and O'Neill (both review Tamerlane)
- Kramer and Lopez (both review Sunset or Undulation)
- O'Neill and Megregian (both review Tamerlane or Sunset or Undulation)
- Lopez and Megregian (both review Sunset or Undulation)

Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Kramer and Lopez cannot review Tamerlane together. 

So, the only possible answer is:
Action: Answer("B")  Kramer and O'Neill
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
From condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. 
Therefore, the third person who reviews Tamerlane must be one of the students who reviews exactly the same play or plays as one of the two students who review Tamerlane. 

From condition 2, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot be one of the students who review Tamerlane. 

From condition 3, Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian must review all three plays, and Kramer and Lopez each review only one or two plays. 

Therefore, the only possible list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer, O'Neill, and one other student who reviews exactly the same play or plays as one of them. 

Option A is not possible because Jiang cannot be one of the students who review Tamerlane. 
Option B is possible because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
Option C is not possible because Lopez cannot review Tamerlane. 
Option D is possible because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and Megregian reviews all three plays. 
Option E is not possible because Megregian must review all three plays, and Lopez cannot review Tamerlane. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.

Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
  From condition 3, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and E because they only have one student reviewing Tamerlane.
  From condition 4, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, we can eliminate option D because it has three students reviewing Tamerlane, which would mean that Megregian reviews all three plays, which contradicts condition 4.
  From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, we can eliminate option C because it has Lopez reviewing Tamerlane, which would mean that Megregian reviews a play that Jiang reviews, which contradicts condition 2.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
Using condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, we know that no other student can review Tamerlane. 
Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Since we know that Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, the only remaining student is Jiang. 
Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Since Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, Megregian cannot review Tamerlane. Therefore, Megregian must review Sunset and Undulation. Lopez and Kramer must review Sunset and Tamerlane, respectively. 
The accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So, any option that does not include both Kramer and O'Neill can be eliminated.
  From condition 4, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. So, any option that does not include Megregian can be eliminated.
  From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So, option A can be eliminated.
  From condition 3, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. So, option D can be eliminated because it includes three students.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
  From condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. So, the students who review Tamerlane must be one of the pairs of students who review the same play or plays as each other.
  From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So, Jiang cannot be one of the students who review Tamerlane.
  From condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. So, Megregian must review all three plays, and Kramer and Lopez must each review only one of the three plays. Therefore, the students who review Tamerlane must be Kramer and O'Neill.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 

Using condition 4, we know that exactly two students review the same play or plays. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, we can eliminate choices A, C, and E because they have only one student reviewing Tamerlane.

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Since we don't know which play(s) Jiang reviews, we can't eliminate any choices based on this condition.

Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. This means that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, we can eliminate choice D because it includes Megregian reviewing Tamerlane, which would mean that Megregian reviews all three plays, contradicting condition 3.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Therefore, the only possible pair of students who review the same play is Kramer and O'Neill, so the answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 

Using condition 4, we know that exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and D because they only have one student reviewing Tamerlane.

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, we can eliminate option E because it has Lopez and O'Neill reviewing Tamerlane with Megregian, and we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.

Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, we can eliminate option C because it has all three students reviewing Tamerlane, but we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.

Action: Answer("B") 
Therefore, the only option left is B, which has Kramer and O'Neill reviewing Tamerlane.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, any option that does not include Kramer and O'Neill cannot be correct. 

Option A includes only Jiang and Kramer, which is not possible because O'Neill also reviews Tamerlane. 

Option B includes only Kramer and O'Neill, which is possible based on condition 1. 

Option C includes Kramer, Lopez, and O'Neill. We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, but Lopez cannot review Tamerlane because of condition 2. Therefore, option C is not possible. 

Option D includes Kramer, Megregian, and O'Neill. We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, but Megregian cannot review Tamerlane because of condition 3. Therefore, option D is not possible. 

Option E includes Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill. We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot be included in the same list as Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill. Therefore, option E is not possible.

  We can eliminate option E because it does not include any French plays, which violates the requirement that at least one French play must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  To satisfy the requirement that at least one French play must be selected, the organizer must select one French play and either one or two French novels.
  To satisfy the requirement that no more than four French works are selected, the organizer can select at most three French novels and one French play.
  To satisfy the requirement that at least three but no more than four novels are selected, the organizer must select either three or four novels.

Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing takes exactly 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day.
  - Franco ≠ Garcia
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong ≠ Monday.
  - At least 1 witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday. Therefore, the following must be true:
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday (given).
  - Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  - Hong cannot testify on Monday (given).
  - At least 1 witness testifies on Monday (given).
  - Jackson must testify on Monday or Tuesday.

Option A is not true because Franco must testify on Tuesday with Hong.
Option B is not true because Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday.
Option C is not true because Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday.
Option D is true because Hong must testify on Tuesday with Franco.
Option E is not true because Jackson can testify on Monday or Tuesday.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must testify on either Monday or Tuesday, since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and there are only three days of the hearing. If Franco and Hong testify on Monday, then Garcia must testify on Tuesday, and Jackson must testify on Wednesday. If Franco and Hong testify on Tuesday, then Garcia must testify on Monday, and Jackson must testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on either Monday or Tuesday.
  
  A: Franco cannot be scheduled to testify on Wednesday, since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  B: If Franco and Hong testify on Monday, then Garcia must testify on Tuesday, so this could be true.
  C: If Franco and Hong testify on Tuesday, then Garcia must testify on Monday, so this cannot be true.
  D: If Franco and Hong testify on Monday, then Jackson must testify on Wednesday, so this cannot be true.
  E: Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday, so this cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("B")

  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday. If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Hong must testify on Monday and Garcia must testify on Wednesday. Jackson must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday, but we don't know which day.
  
  A: Franco cannot testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia testifies on Wednesday, which is not the same day as Franco.
  C: Garcia testifies on Wednesday, which is not the same day as Franco.
  D: Hong testifies on Monday, which is the same day as Franco.
  E: We know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so this statement cannot be true.

  3. If exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday (from 6), then the remaining three witnesses must testify on Monday and Wednesday.
  4. If Iturbe testifies on Wednesday (from 5), then Franco and Garcia must testify on Monday.
  5. If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday (from 7).
  6. Therefore, Hong must testify on Wednesday, and Garcia must testify on Monday (from 4 and 5).
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing takes exactly 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must be scheduled on either Tuesday or Wednesday. This means that Garcia must be scheduled on Monday. Iturbe can only be scheduled on Wednesday, and since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, then Jackson and either Franco or Hong must be scheduled on Tuesday.
  
  A: Franco cannot be scheduled on Wednesday because Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on that day.
  B: This is true. Garcia must be scheduled on Monday.
  C: Garcia cannot be scheduled on Wednesday because Franco or Hong must be scheduled on Tuesday.
  D: This is possible, but not necessarily true. Hong could also be scheduled on Wednesday.
  E: This is not true. Jackson must also be scheduled to testify on Tuesday.

  1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Franco cannot testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Wednesday. Since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, no other witness can testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Monday and Garcia must testify on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing is 3 days long: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco ≠ Garcia
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong ≠ Monday
  - At least 1 witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, we know that exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Franco must testify on Wednesday. This means that Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, and must testify on Monday. Garcia cannot testify on Monday because Franco and Hong are already scheduled to testify on those days. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Tuesday. Jackson is the only witness left, so he must testify on Monday.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing takes place on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must testify on either Tuesday or Wednesday. However, we know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. So, Garcia must testify on Monday and Jackson must testify on Wednesday. This leaves Hong to testify on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday. Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday and Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, Garcia must testify on Monday. Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. Hong cannot testify on Monday, so Jackson must testify on Monday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing is 3 days long: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day.
  - Franco ≠ Garcia
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong ≠ Monday.
  - At least 1 witness testifies on Monday.
  
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must be scheduled on either Monday or Tuesday. Since Hong ≠ Monday, Hong must be scheduled on Tuesday. Therefore, exactly two witnesses (Hong and one other witness) testify on Tuesday. Since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, Garcia must testify on Monday. This leaves only Wednesday for Franco to testify. Therefore, the only option that must be true of the schedule is that Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A corporate manager is selecting employees for a research team. The team will include at least four employees, all from among the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre. The selection is constrained by the following conditions: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team?
Choices:
  A: Ortega and Schmidt
  B: Ortega and Wong
  C: Paine and Schmidt
  D: Thomson and Yoder
  E: Yoder and Zayre
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  
Analysis:
  If Ortega is on the team, Myers cannot be on the team. Therefore, Wong cannot be on the team. This eliminates option B and E.
  If Paine is on the team, Schmidt and Thomson must also be on the team. Therefore, Myers and Wong cannot be on the team. This eliminates option A.
  If Thomson is on the team, Paine and Schmidt must also be on the team. Therefore, Myers and Wong must also be on the team. This eliminates option D.
  This leaves option C as the only possible answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  To satisfy the constraints, we can start by identifying the employees who must be on the team if they are selected. 
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be, so Myers cannot be paired with either Ortega or Paine.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be, so Schmidt must be paired with both Paine and Thomson.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be, so Wong must be paired with both Myers and Yoder.
  Therefore, the only pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Yoder and Myers, because if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
  A: Ortega and Schmidt cannot be on the team together.
  B: Wong is on the team, but neither Ortega nor Schmidt is required to be on the team.
  C: Schmidt is on the team, but Paine is required to be on the team, not Ortega.
  D: Wong is on the team, but Thomson is required to be on the team, not Yoder.
  E: Yoder is required to be on the team if Wong is on the team, but Zayre is not required to be on the team.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  To form a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team, we need to look for employees who are required to be on the team because of the given constraints. 
  Wong is required to be on the team if Myers and Yoder are on the team, but we don't know if Myers and Yoder will be on the team. So, we cannot form a pair with Wong.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. So, if we select Myers, we must select at least one of Ortega or Paine. 
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. So, if we select Schmidt, we must select both Paine and Thomson.
  Thomson and Yoder are not required to be on the team, so we cannot form a pair with them.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
  If we select Wong, we must select Myers and Yoder. So, the pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Ortega and Wong.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  
Analysis:
  - If Ortega is on the team, neither Myers nor Paine can be on the team.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  - Therefore, if we select Wong, we must select Myers and Yoder as well.
  - Therefore, the pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is (Ortega and Wong).
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  To form a pair of employees, we need to find two employees who must be on the team together or at least one of them must be on the team. 
  Ortega and Schmidt cannot be on the team together because of the first condition. 
  Wong must be on the team with Myers and Yoder, so Ortega cannot be on the team with Wong. 
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be, so Paine and Schmidt must be on the team together. 
  Thomson and Yoder are not linked to any other employee, so they can be on the team together or at least one of them must be on the team. 
  Zayre is not linked to any other employee, so he/she can be on the team or not. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  To form a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team, we need to look for employees who are either required to be on the team or whose presence on the team does not violate any of the given conditions. 
  Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team. 
  Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must all be on the team if Schmidt is on the team.
  Myers and Yoder must be on the team if Wong is on the team.
  Zayre is not mentioned in any of the conditions.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
  Ortega and Wong is a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team because if Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team, and if Myers is not on the team, Ortega can be on the team.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  To form a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team, we need to find two employees who are not mutually exclusive with each other. That is, at least one of them must be on the team, but it is possible that both of them are on the team. 
  Ortega and Schmidt are mutually exclusive because if Schmidt is on the team, Paine must also be on the team, and if Paine is on the team, Ortega cannot be on the team. 
  Wong and Myers are mutually exclusive because if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team, and if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. 
  Paine and Thomson are not mutually exclusive because if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must be on the team, and if Schmidt is not on the team, either Paine or Thomson (or both) can still be on the team. 
  Thomson and Yoder are not mutually exclusive because there are no constraints on them being on the team together. 
  Yoder and Zayre are not mutually exclusive, but there are no constraints on them being on the team together.

E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
  - According to the rules, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, this assignment is not possible because Xu is assigned parking space #5, which is a lower-numbered parking space than Souza's parking space #2.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees and six parking spaces.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  
Analysis:
  According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6. Since Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, it follows that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3. 
  According to the rules, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, it follows that Xu must be assigned parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6. 
  According to the rules, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, it follows that Young must be assigned parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6. 
  Based on the above analysis, we can eliminate options A and E because they violate the rules. Option B violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Option C violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The rules for assigning parking spaces are:
  - Young > Togowa
  - Xu > Souza
  - Robertson > Young
  - Robertson <= 4
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  
Analysis:
  From the rules, we know that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, options A and E are not possible because Robertson is not assigned any of those spaces. Option B is not possible because Robertson is assigned parking space #5, which is not allowed. Option C is not possible because Togowa is assigned parking space #1, which is not allowed. The only option that satisfies all the rules is option D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The rules state that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.

  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5, and Young cannot be assigned parking space #3.
  - Based on the above rules, the only possible assignment is: 
    #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  - Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces:
    1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
    
Analysis:
  From rule 4, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  From rule 3, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  From rule 1, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  From rule 2, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, the possible orderings are:
    Robertson, Young, Togowa, Xu, Souza, Vaughn
    Robertson, Young, Togowa, Xu, Vaughn, Souza
    Robertson, Young, Xu, Togowa, Souza, Vaughn
    Robertson, Young, Xu, Togowa, Vaughn, Souza
    Robertson, Young, Xu, Vaughn, Togowa, Souza
    Robertson, Young, Xu, Vaughn, Souza, Togowa
  Only one of the answer choices matches one of these orderings.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The rules state that:
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.

A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
- Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is higher-numbered than #1, #2, and #3.
- Young is assigned parking space #1, which is lower-numbered than Togowa's parking space #5, so this violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
- Xu is assigned parking space #6, which is higher-numbered than Souza's parking space #2, so this satisfies the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
- Therefore, this option violates one of the rules, so it cannot be the correct answer.

B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
- Robertson is assigned parking space #5, which is higher-numbered than #1, #2, #3, and #4.
- Young is assigned parking space #3, which is higher-numbered than Togowa's parking space #2, so this satisfies the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
- Xu is assigned parking space #6, which is higher-numbered than Souza's parking space #4, so this satisfies the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
- Therefore, this option satisfies all of the rules, so it could be the correct answer.

C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
- Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is higher-numbered than #1, #2, and #3.
- Young is assigned parking space #2, which is higher-numbered than Togowa's parking space #1, so this satisfies the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
- Xu is assigned parking space #3, which is higher-numbered than Souza's parking space #5, so this satisfies the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
- Therefore, this option satisfies all of the rules, so it could be the correct answer.

D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
- Robertson is assigned parking space #2, which is higher-numbered than #1.
- Young is assigned parking space #3, which is higher-numbered than Togowa's parking space #1, so this satisfies the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
- Xu is assigned parking space #6, which is higher-numbered than Souza's parking space #4, so this satisfies the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
- Therefore, this option satisfies all of the rules, so it could be the correct answer.

E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
- Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is higher-numbered than #1, #2, and #3.
- Young is assigned parking space #3, which is higher-numbered than Togowa's parking space #2, so this satisfies the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
- Xu is assigned parking space #5, which is higher-numbered than Souza's parking space #1, so this violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
- Therefore, this option violates one of the rules, so it cannot be the correct answer.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1923.
  B: Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1924.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.

  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the following:
  1. Julio's session is not on Friday, so it must be on Wednesday or Thursday morning.
  2. Olivia's session is not on Thursday afternoon, so it must be on Wednesday afternoon or Friday morning.
  3. Lan's session is not on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning, so it must be on Wednesday morning or Thursday morning.
  4. Nessa's session is on Thursday afternoon.
  5. Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on Wednesday and Friday.
  
  Therefore, we can determine the lab assistant for all sessions except for one of the Thursday morning or Wednesday afternoon sessions.

  Therefore, we can determine the sessions of 4 lab assistants: Julio, Olivia, Nessa, and Lan.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days.
  2. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  7. Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  
Based on the given information, we can determine the following:
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so one of them must lead a session on Wednesday and the other on Friday.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so he must lead a session on Wednesday or Thursday morning.
  
Using this information, we can determine the lab assistant for the following sessions:
  - Wednesday morning: Lan or Olivia
  - Wednesday afternoon: Kevin or Rebecca
  - Thursday morning: Julio
  - Thursday afternoon: Nessa
  - Friday morning: Lan or Olivia
  - Friday afternoon: Kevin or Rebecca
  
Therefore, we can determine the lab assistant for 2 sessions (Thursday morning and Thursday afternoon) in addition to Julio's session, for a total of 3 sessions. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon.
  3. Each lab assistant leads one lab session.
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  6. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  7. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Solution:
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the following:
  1. Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  2. Olivia cannot lead any session on Thursday because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  3. Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session because she must lead an afternoon session and Thursday afternoon session is already assigned to Julio.
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, they must lead the Wednesday sessions (one in the morning and one in the afternoon).
  5. Lan cannot lead any session on Thursday because Olivia cannot lead any session on Thursday. Therefore, Lan must lead the Wednesday morning session and Olivia must lead the Friday morning session.
  
  Based on the above deductions, we can determine the sessions led by the following lab assistants:
  - Julio: Thursday afternoon
  - Kevin: Wednesday morning and Wednesday afternoon
  - Rebecca: Wednesday morning and Wednesday afternoon
  - Nessa: Friday afternoon
  We cannot determine the sessions led by Lan and Olivia because they could lead either the Friday morning or the Thursday morning session.
  
  Therefore, the answer is A: one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - The lab sessions are scheduled over three days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  - Each day has one morning session and one afternoon session.
  - There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the following:
  - Julio's session is on Thursday afternoon.
  - Olivia's session is on Friday (because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's).
  - Lan's session is on Wednesday (because Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day).
  - Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon (because Nessa must lead an afternoon session).
  
  We know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, but we don't know which day that is. Therefore, we cannot determine which sessions they lead.
  
  This leaves us with two lab assistants whose sessions we can determine:
  - Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  - Lan leads the Wednesday morning session.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Wednesday afternoon session. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead the Thursday morning session and the Friday morning session. Lan is the only lab assistant left, so she must lead the Wednesday morning session. Therefore, for four of the lab assistants (Kevin, Rebecca, Nessa, and Olivia), we can determine which sessions they lead. For Julio and Lan, we only know the day and time of their sessions, not the specific session they lead. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are 6 lab sessions: 3 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we know that Olivia's session must be on Friday.
  - Since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Lan's session must be on Wednesday and Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on Thursday.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  - Therefore, the lab assistant assignments are as follows:
    - Wednesday morning: Lan
    - Wednesday afternoon: Kevin
    - Thursday morning: Rebecca
    - Thursday afternoon: Julio
    - Friday morning: Nessa
    - Friday afternoon: Olivia
  - We can determine the sessions for all the lab assistants except for one.

Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Four students - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs - will display exactly two paintings each, an oil and a watercolor.
  Two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position. This means that Hidalgo's paintings are displayed on the same wall, which contradicts the condition that no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, the answer is D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a table to keep track of which students can give reports on which days and at which times.

| Day | Morning | Afternoon |
| --- | ------- | --------- |
| Mon |         |           |
| Tue | George  |           |
| Wed |         |           |

We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Therefore, we can deduce that the remaining five students will give reports as follows:

| Day | Morning | Afternoon |
| --- | ------- | --------- |
| Mon | Kyle    | Olivia    |
| Tue | George  | Lenore    |
| Wed | Irving  | Helen     |

Now we can check each pair of students to see which pair must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.

A: George and Lenore - George must give his report on Tuesday, so this pair cannot give reports on the same day as each other.
B: Helen and Nina - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, this pair cannot give reports on the same day as each other.
C: Irving and Robert - Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so this pair cannot give reports on the same day as each other.
D: Kyle and Nina - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, this pair cannot give reports on the same day as each other.
E: Olivia and Kyle - Olivia can only give a morning report, so this pair cannot give reports on the same day as each other.

Action: Answer("None of the Above") 
None of the pairs can give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.

  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Solution:
  From condition 1, George will give a report on Tuesday.
  From condition 2, Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report. Hence, they will give a morning report.
  From condition 3, if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Hence, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina will give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  From condition 4, exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Hence, there will be one morning report and one afternoon report on each day.
  
  Case 1: Nina gives a report on Monday
    From condition 3, if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Hence, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina will give a report on Wednesday.
    From condition 4, exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Hence, on Monday, one student will give a morning report and another student will give an afternoon report.
    From condition 5, exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Hence, the remaining five students will give reports on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    If Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday, then Kyle and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday. Hence, George and Nina must give reports on Wednesday. This means that Olivia and Robert must give reports on Tuesday.
    Therefore, the pairs of students who must give reports on Wednesday are:
      - George and Nina
      - Helen and Irving
      
  Case 2: Nina gives a report on Wednesday
    From condition 3, if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Hence, Nina cannot give a report on Monday. Therefore, Nina will give a report on Monday.
    From condition 4, exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Hence, on Wednesday, one student will give a morning report and another student will give an afternoon report.
    From condition 5, exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Hence, the remaining five students will give reports on Monday and Tuesday.
    If Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday, then Kyle and Lenore must give reports on Monday. Hence, George and Nina must give reports on Tuesday. This means that Olivia and Robert must give reports on Monday.
    Therefore, the pairs of students who must give reports on Wednesday are:
      - George and Nina
      - Helen and Irving
      
  The pairs of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday are:
    - George and Nina

  3. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then there is no requirement for anyone else to give a report on Wednesday.
  4. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give reports in the morning.
  5. Therefore, the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday must be paired with someone else who will give a report on Wednesday as well.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then on Tuesday both Helen and Irving must give reports. Therefore, if Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Solution:

  From condition 2, Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report. So, they will give their reports in the morning.
  From condition 3, if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  So, there are two possibilities:
  1. Nina gives her report on Monday. In this case, Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. So, Kyle and Lenore will give their reports on Wednesday. Therefore, the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are Kyle and Nina.
  2. Nina gives her report on Wednesday. In this case, Helen and Irving can give their reports on any day. So, we cannot determine the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a table to keep track of who can give reports on which days and in which time slots:

| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |
| --------- |:----------------:| ----------:|
| Monday    | ?                | ?          |
| Tuesday   | George           | ?          |
| Wednesday | ?                | ?          |

From the given information, we can deduce the following:
- Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give their reports in the morning.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then there are no restrictions on who can give reports on Thursday.

Using this information, we can fill in the table as follows:

| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |
| --------- |:----------------:| ----------:|
| Monday    | Olivia or Robert | Nina       |
| Tuesday   | George           | Lenore     |
| Wednesday | Helen and Irving | Kyle       |

Now we can look at each pair of students and determine whether they must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other:
- A: George and Lenore: George can only give a report on Tuesday, so this pair cannot give reports on the same day.
- B: Helen and Nina: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday. In either case, this pair must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other. Therefore, this is the correct answer.
- C: Irving and Robert: Robert can only give a report in the morning, so this pair cannot give reports on the same day.
- D: Kyle and Nina: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Kyle must give his report on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Kyle cannot give a report on Wednesday because Helen and Irving must give reports on that day. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then there are no restrictions on who can give reports on Thursday. Therefore, this pair may or may not give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
- E: Olivia and Kyle: Kyle cannot give a report on Monday because Olivia or Robert must give a report in the morning. If Kyle gives a report on Tuesday, then Olivia must give a report on Wednesday, but there are no restrictions on who can give reports with Olivia. If Kyle gives a report on Wednesday, then he cannot give a report with Olivia because she cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, this pair may or may not give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.

  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a table to keep track of which students can give reports on which days and in which time slots:

| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Monday      |       |       |
| Tuesday     | George |       |
| Wednesday   |       |       |

From the table, we can see that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Wednesday. Also, neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give reports in the morning. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, because if she does, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, and no other students can give reports on Tuesday. This means that George must give a report on Wednesday, and Lenore and Kyle must give reports on Monday. If Nina does not give a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, and no other students can give reports on Tuesday. This means that George must give a report on Wednesday, and either Kyle or Nina must give a report on Monday. 

Now, we can check each pair of students to see which pair must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other:
  A. George and Lenore: George cannot give a report on Wednesday, so this pair cannot give reports on Wednesday.
  B. Helen and Nina: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, and George must give a report on Wednesday. This means that Nina and Helen must give reports on Wednesday. If Nina does not give a report on Monday, then George must give a report on Tuesday, and Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. This means that Helen and Nina cannot give reports on Wednesday.
  C. Irving and Robert: Neither of these students can give a report on Wednesday, so this pair cannot give reports on Wednesday.
  D. Kyle and Nina: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, and George must give a report on Wednesday. This means that Kyle and Nina cannot give reports on Wednesday. If Nina does not give a report on Monday, then George must give a report on Tuesday, and Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. This means that Kyle and Nina cannot give reports on Wednesday.
  E. Olivia and Kyle: Neither of these students can give an afternoon report, so they must give reports in the morning. If Kyle gives a report on Monday, then Olivia must give a report on Tuesday, and George must give a report on Wednesday. This means that Olivia and Kyle cannot give reports on Wednesday. If Kyle does not give a report on Monday, then either Kyle or Nina must give a report on Monday, and Olivia must give a report on Tuesday. This means that Olivia and Kyle cannot give reports on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("B") - Helen and Nina
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
  A: There is no information about George and Lenore giving reports on the same day.
  B: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday.
  C: There is no information about Irving and Robert giving reports on the same day.
  D: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Kyle and Nina give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday.
  E: There is no information about Olivia and Kyle giving reports on the same day.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a table to keep track of the students' possible report days and times:

| Day/Time | Morning | Afternoon |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Monday   |         |           |
| Tuesday  | George  |           |
| Wednesday|         |           |

From condition 3, if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving can give reports on any day.

If George gives a report on Tuesday, then we can fill in the table as follows:

| Day/Time | Morning | Afternoon |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Monday   |         |           |
| Tuesday  | George  |           |
| Wednesday|         |           |

From condition 2, neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. This means that if either Olivia or Robert gives a report, it must be in the morning. If both of them give reports, one must be on Monday and the other on Wednesday.

If Nina gives a report, then we can fill in the table as follows:

| Day/Time | Morning | Afternoon |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Monday   |         |           |
| Tuesday  | George  |           |
| Wednesday|  Nina   |           |

From condition 3, if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday if Nina's report is on Wednesday, or on Tuesday if Nina's report is on Monday.

If neither Olivia nor Robert gives a report, then we can fill in the table as follows:

| Day/Time | Morning | Afternoon |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Monday   | Helen/Irving | Olivia/Robert |
| Tuesday  | George  | Olivia/Robert |
| Wednesday|  Nina   | Helen/Irving |

From the table, we can see that the only pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other are Helen and Nina. Therefore, the answer is B: Helen and Nina.

Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.

  - If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures is either: oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs.
  
A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. This would mean that Farley's lecture would be first, the watercolors lecture would be third, and the oil paintings lecture would be fourth. This violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, A is not true.

B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then the order of the lectures would be: watercolors, sculptures, oil paintings, lithographs. This satisfies all of the constraints. Therefore, B could be true.

C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the order of the lectures would be: watercolors, oil paintings, sculptures, lithographs. This violates the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture. Therefore, C is not true.

D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then the order of the lectures would be: watercolors, oil paintings, sculptures, lithographs. This satisfies all of the constraints. Therefore, D could be true.

E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the order of the lectures would be: watercolors, oil paintings, sculptures, lithographs. This satisfies all of the constraints. Therefore, E could be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are four lectures, one on each topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian gives one lecture on a different topic.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

If the watercolors lecture is third, then we know that the order of the lectures is either:
1. Lithographs, oil paintings, watercolors, sculptures
2. Oil paintings, lithographs, watercolors, sculptures

Option A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. This is not possible in either of the two orders, so A is not true.

Option B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then the watercolors lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. This is true in both orders, so B could be true.

Option C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. This is not possible in either of the two orders, so C is not true.

Option D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must both be after the sculptures lecture. This is not possible in either of the two orders, so D is not true.

Option E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. This is true in both orders, so E could be true.

  B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then he must give the second lecture, which is watercolors. This violates the constraint that the watercolors lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then he must give the fourth lecture, which is lithographs. This violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then he must give the third lecture, which is watercolors. This is consistent with the given information, so D could be true.
  E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then he must give the first lecture, which is oil paintings. This violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, E is not true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- There are four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang.
- There are four lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
- Each art historian will give one lecture on a different topic.
- The lectures will be given one at a time.
- The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
- Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
- Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

If the watercolors lecture is third, then we know that the order of the lectures is either:
1. Lithographs, oil paintings, watercolors, sculptures
2. Oil paintings, lithographs, watercolors, sculptures

A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. This is not possible in either of the two lecture orders, so A is not true.
B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be later than the watercolors lecture. This is not possible in either of the two lecture orders, so B is not true.
C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. This is possible in the first lecture order, so C could be true.
D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. This is possible in the first lecture order, so D could be true.
E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. This is not possible in either of the two lecture orders, so E is not true.

Action: Answer("C") or Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are four lectures, one on each topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian gives a lecture on a different topic.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, then either the oil paintings lecture or the watercolors lecture is first, and the other is second.

Action: Answer("D") 

If the watercolors lecture is third, then either the oil paintings lecture or the sculptures lecture is first, and the other is second. Since Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, Holden's lecture must be first. Therefore, Holden gives the sculptures lecture. This means that Garcia and Jiang must give the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture, but it is not clear which one gives which lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley gives the lithographs lecture. The only option that is consistent with these constraints is that Holden gives the sculptures lecture. So, the answer is D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are four lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian gives one lecture.
  - The lectures are given one at a time.
  - Farley's lecture is before the oil paintings lecture.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture are before the lithographs lecture.
  - Holden's lecture is before Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures is:
  1. Either oil paintings or sculptures
  2. The other one between oil paintings and sculptures
  3. Watercolors
  4. Lithographs
  
  A: Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture because it is already given by someone else.
  B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Holden's lecture must be the sculptures lecture, which means Jiang's lecture must be the lithographs lecture. This violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture are before the lithographs lecture. Therefore, B is not possible.
  C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be the oil paintings lecture, which means Jiang's lecture must be the lithographs lecture. This violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture are before the lithographs lecture. Therefore, C is not possible.
  D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Garcia's lecture must be the oil paintings lecture, which means Jiang's lecture must be the lithographs lecture. This satisfies all the constraints and is a possible order of lectures. Therefore, D could be true.
  E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then Holden's lecture must be the oil paintings lecture, which means Garcia's lecture must be the sculptures lecture. This violates the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture. Therefore, E is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures, each on a different topic.
  - The topics are lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian will give a lecture on a different topic, one at a time.
  - The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints:
    - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
    - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
    - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures must be: [?, ?, watercolors, ?].
  
Analysis:
  - Since the watercolors lecture is third, we know that the order of the lectures must be: [?, ?, watercolors, ?].
  - According to the constraints, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - We need to find an option that is consistent with these constraints and the fact that the watercolors lecture is third.
  
Solution:
  - Since the watercolors lecture is third, we know that the order of the lectures must be: [?, ?, watercolors, ?].
  - According to the constraints, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be last.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden must give the first lecture, and Garcia and Jiang must give the second and fourth lectures in some order.
  - Since the watercolors lecture is third, Garcia and Jiang cannot give the watercolors lecture. Therefore, Farley must give the watercolors lecture.
  - Option A is consistent with these constraints and the fact that the watercolors lecture is third.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. There are four lectures, each on a different topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  2. Each art historian gives a lecture on a different topic.
  3. The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  4. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  5. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  
Since the watercolors lecture is third, we can deduce that the oil paintings lecture must be first or second, and the lithographs lecture must be last. Also, Farley's lecture must be first or second, and Holden's lecture must be first. 

A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture. This is not possible because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which means it must be first or second. 

B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. This is possible because the oil paintings lecture must be first or second, and Garcia's lecture must be later than Holden's lecture. 

C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. This is not possible because Garcia's lecture must be later than Holden's lecture, and Holden's lecture must be first. 

D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. This is possible because Holden's lecture must be first, and Garcia's and Jiang's lectures must be later. 

E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. This is possible because the lithographs lecture must be last, and Jiang's lecture must be later than Holden's and Garcia's lectures.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F, G, K, L, or M must be the other two scientists selected.
  
  We can eliminate option C because it is not necessarily true that if exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. The panel could include L and M, for example.
  
  We can eliminate option D because it is not necessarily true that if exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. The panel could include K, L, and either F or G.
  
  Option A is also not necessarily true. If P is the only zoologist selected, then F and G could both be selected with K not being selected.
  
  Option E is also not necessarily true. If exactly two chemists are selected, then the panel could include K and L with either F or G.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, if L is selected, F cannot be selected.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
- If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- F and K cannot both be selected.
- K and M cannot both be selected.
- If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Action: Answer("B")

If P is the only zoologist selected, then there must be at least one botanist and one chemist selected. If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which means P cannot be selected. Therefore, F cannot be selected if P is the only zoologist selected. Hence, if L is selected, F cannot be selected. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  We need to select a panel of five scientists from among three botanists, three chemists, and three zoologists.
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then we must select at least one botanist and one chemist. We cannot select more than one botanist. If we select M, then we must select both P and R. If we select F, we cannot select K. 

A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. We can select K and G with P, but we cannot select F in this case. This is not necessarily true.
B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. We can select L, F, and P, but we cannot select M in this case. This is not necessarily true.
C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. We need to select at least one botanist and one chemist. If we select only one chemist, we can select any of the three chemists. This is not necessarily true.
D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. We need to select at least one botanist and one chemist. If we select two chemists, we can select any two of the three chemists. We can then select either F or G as the botanist. This is not necessarily true.
E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. We need to select at least one botanist and one chemist. If we select two chemists, we can select any two of the three chemists. We can then select either F or G as the botanist. If we select K and L, we cannot select G. This is true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and either K or L must be selected as a chemist. M cannot be selected because both P and R must be selected if M is selected, which would violate the rule that there can be at most one zoologist if more than one botanist is selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, then L must also be selected as a chemist, which would violate the rule that F or G must be selected as a botanist if P is the only zoologist selected. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If L is selected, then K must also be selected as a chemist, which would violate the rule that F or G must be selected as a botanist if P is the only zoologist selected. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and P must be selected as the zoologist. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and P must be selected as the zoologist. Therefore, D is true.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and P must be selected as the zoologist. Therefore, E is not true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, then M cannot be selected. However, there is no restriction on selecting G if K is selected. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  B: If L is selected, then K and M cannot be selected. However, there is no restriction on selecting F if L is selected. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. This statement is not true because there is no such restriction.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. This statement is true because if F is selected, then at least two botanists will be selected, which means at most one zoologist can be selected. But since P is the only zoologist selected, this is not possible.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. This statement is not necessarily true because if K and L are selected, then G can still be selected.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and either K, L, or M must be selected as a chemist.
  
  Let's evaluate each choice:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
     There is no direct relationship between K and G. This choice is not necessarily true.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
     There is no direct relationship between L and F. This choice is not necessarily true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
     This is not true. If only one chemist is selected, it could be any of K, L, or M.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
     This is not true. If exactly two chemists are selected, they could be any of K, L, or M, and F could still be selected as a botanist.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
     This is true. If exactly two chemists are selected, and one of them is K, then G cannot be selected as a botanist because of the condition that F and K cannot both be selected.

  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R are not selected.
  
Analysis:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R are not selected. Therefore, if M is selected, it is impossible to satisfy the condition that both P and R must be selected. Therefore, M cannot be selected. Since K and M cannot both be selected, K must be selected. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Since P is the only zoologist selected, at most one botanist is selected. Therefore, either F or G is selected. However, F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, G must be selected. 

A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not true. G must be selected if P is the only zoologist selected.
B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. - This is not true. F must be selected if P is the only zoologist selected.
C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. - This is true, as K is the only chemist that can be selected.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, they cannot work in Zones 1 or 2. Therefore, they must work in Zone 3.
  Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3, and at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 2.
  Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, the other one must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  Since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, the other one must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  Therefore, there are two possible configurations for the sales representatives in the sales zones:
  Configuration 1: Zone 1 (Parra or Tiao), Zone 2 (Udall or Tiao), Zone 3 (Kim, Mahr, Quinn, Stuckey)
  Configuration 2: Zone 1 (Parra or Tiao), Zone 2 (Udall or Parra), Zone 3 (Kim, Mahr, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao or Udall)
  In both configurations, Quinn works in Zone 3. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as A: Kim, B: Mahr, or C: Stuckey.
  Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  We need to find the sales representative that Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  Also, either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, we can conclude that Tiao and Udall work in Zones 1 and 2, respectively, and Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3.
  This means that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, then there are only 2 sales representatives (Quinn and Parra) in that sales zone, which means that there would be at most 2 sales representatives in each of the other two sales zones. This would contradict the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra. 
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Tiao, then there are only 2 sales representatives (Quinn and Tiao) in that sales zone, which means that there would be at most 2 sales representatives in each of the other two sales zones. This would contradict the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Udall, then there are only 2 sales representatives (Quinn and Udall) in that sales zone, which means that there would be at most 2 sales representatives in each of the other two sales zones. This would contradict the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Kim, Mahr, or Stuckey, then there would be at least 3 sales representatives in that sales zone, which means that there would be at most 2 sales representatives in one of the other two sales zones. This would contradict the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn can work in the same sales zone as Kim, Mahr, or Stuckey.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then Quinn cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, the answer must be either B, C, D, or E. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, then Quinn cannot work in Zone 3. Therefore, the answer must be either B, C, or D. Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, and Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then the answer must be D: Tiao.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  To determine who Quinn cannot work with, we need to find out who Quinn is already working with.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as either Parra, Stuckey, or Udall.
  Kim, Mahr, and Tiao are not mentioned in relation to Quinn's sales zone, so they could potentially work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives and 3 sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn is in the same sales zone as Parra, then Tiao and Udall must be in Zone 2 and Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey must be in Zone 3. This would mean that Quinn is in Zone 1, which is possible.
  
  If Quinn is in the same sales zone as Quinn, then Tiao and Udall must be in Zone 2 and Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey must be in Zone 3. This would mean that there are 4 sales representatives in Zone 3 and only 2 in Zone 2, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, Quinn cannot be in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  
  A: Kim's sales zone is unknown.
  B: Mahr's sales zone is unknown.
  C: Stuckey cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  D: Tiao's sales zone is unknown.
  E: Udall's sales zone is unknown.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: Since Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, and Parra is either in Zone 1 or Zone 3, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, who is also in the same sales zone as Udall. Therefore, the answer is C, Stuckey.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3, and Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, respectively. This would mean that Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey are all in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, then there are at most 2 sales representatives working in that zone, which contradicts the fact that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra. 
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Tiao, then Udall must work in Zone 3, which means that there are at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 2, which contradicts the fact that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Udall, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3, which means that there are at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 2, which contradicts the fact that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Kim, then there are at most 2 sales representatives working in that zone, which contradicts the fact that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Kim.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Mahr, then there are at most 2 sales representatives working in that zone, which contradicts the fact that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Mahr.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then Udall must work in Zone 3, which means that there are at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 2, which contradicts the fact that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a sales representative that cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra also works in Zone 1, which means Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 3. This leaves Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey to work in Zone 3, but this violates the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
  
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then Tiao also works in Zone 2, which means Parra works in Zone 1, and Udall works in Zone 3. This leaves Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey to work in Zone 3, which satisfies the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn can work in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then Stuckey also works in Zone 3, which means Udall works in Zone 3, and either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1. This leaves Kim, Mahr, and either Parra or Tiao to work in Zone 1, which satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, Quinn can work in Zone 3.
  
  Therefore, the only option left is C: Stuckey. If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then Udall also works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, which violates the condition that Udall and Tiao cannot work in the same sales zone.

  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are six lab sessions: Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Thursday morning. Lan cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because Olivia's session is on Thursday morning. Therefore, Lan's session must be on Friday morning and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because Kevin's session is on Thursday afternoon. Therefore, the lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio and Nessa.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  The Thursday morning session cannot be led by Julio, Kevin, or Rebecca since they are already assigned to sessions that meet on the same day.
  The Thursday morning session cannot be led by Lan or Olivia since they cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. This means that Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Thursday morning. Therefore, the lab assistants available to lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio and Nessa. So, the answer is A.

Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then the order of the sessions is Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
  The Thursday afternoon session is the second afternoon session.
  
Analysis:
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session is on Wednesday afternoon and Nessa's session is on Thursday afternoon. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Friday morning. Lan cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because she cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia. Therefore, the lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Nessa, Kevin, and Rebecca.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are six lab sessions: Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. Therefore, Olivia and Lan cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning or afternoon, and Olivia's session must be on Friday morning or afternoon. Therefore, Julio and Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. This leaves Kevin and Rebecca as the only lab assistants who can lead the Thursday afternoon session.

Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, which one of the following is the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will fill the six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon must perform in slot two and Yardsign must perform in slot three.
  - Wellspring must perform in a slot earlier than Xpert, which means Wellspring cannot perform in slot six.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - If Zircon performs in slot two, then Yardsign must perform in slot three.
  - Wellspring must perform in a slot earlier than Xpert, which means Wellspring cannot perform in slot six.
  - Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot three.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will fill six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon must perform in slot 1 or 2, and Yardsign must perform in slot 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If Zircon performs in slot 1, then Wellspring can perform in slot 2, but this violates the constraint that Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
  - Therefore, Zircon must perform in slot 2, and Yardsign must perform in slot 3.
  - Since Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Xpert cannot perform in slot 2, then Wellspring must perform in slot 3.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—will fill six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3 and Zircon must perform in slot 2.
  
  A: If Yardsign performs in slot 3, then Wellspring cannot perform in slot 2 because Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Wellspring. Therefore, Wellspring cannot perform in slot 2. 
  B: If Yardsign performs in slot 3, then Wellspring can perform in slot 3 because it performs in an earlier slot than Xpert and Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  C: If Yardsign performs in slot 3, then Wellspring can perform in slot 4 because it performs in an earlier slot than Xpert and Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  D: If Yardsign performs in slot 3, then Wellspring can perform in slot 5 because it performs in an earlier slot than Xpert and Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  E: If Yardsign performs in slot 3, then Wellspring can perform in slot 6 because it performs in an earlier slot than Xpert and Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will fill six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then there are two possible scenarios:
  1. Yardsign performs in slot 2 and Zircon performs in slot 1.
  2. Yardsign performs in slot 3 and Zircon performs in slot 1 or 2.
  
  In both scenarios, Wellspring could perform in slot 3, which is the earliest slot that satisfies the given constraints.

  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  
  From constraint 1, Vegemite must perform before Zircon.
  From constraint 2, Wellspring and Zircon must perform before Xpert.
  From constraint 3, Uneasy must perform in slot 4, 5, or 6.
  From constraint 4, Yardsign must perform in slot 1, 2, or 3.
  From constraint 5, Zircon must perform in a slot later than Yardsign.
  
  Therefore, the order of the bands must be: Yardsign, Vegemite, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy.

  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3, and Zircon must perform in slot 4 or 5.
Question: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, which one of the following is the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform?
Solution: 
  - If Yardsign performs in slot 3, then the only slots available for Wellspring are slots 1, 2, and 4.
  - However, if Zircon performs in slot 4, then the only slots available for Wellspring are slots 1, 2, and 3.
  - Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 1 or 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—will perform in just one slot each.
  - The order must meet the following constraints:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Xpert must perform in slot 6.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must perform in either slot 4, 5, or 6.
  - Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 2.
Action: Answer("A")

  6. Villas
  7. White
  
  Since Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, and we don't know the position of Tao, we cannot determine the position of Stanton in the order of recruitment.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment could be: Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White or Peters, Tao, Stanton, Rovero, Quinn, Villas, White.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), Villas, White, and (unknown) could be Tao or Stanton.
  
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of recruitment would be Stanton, (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), and there would be no way to place Tao, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Villas, or White in the remaining six spots.
  
  If Stanton was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be (unknown), Stanton, (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), and there would be no way to place Tao, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Villas, or White in the remaining five spots.
  
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be (unknown), (unknown), Stanton, (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), and Peters would have to be first, which would contradict the fact that Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment would be (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), Stanton, (unknown), (unknown), and there would be no way to place Tao, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Villas, or White in the remaining five spots.
  
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order of recruitment would be (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), Stanton, and there would be no way to place Tao, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Villas, or White in the remaining five spots.
  
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited first, second, third, fifth, or seventh.

Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices could be:
  Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, Stanton
  or
  Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Quinn, Tao, Stanton
  
  In either case, Stanton would have been recruited fifth.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  There are seven accomplices in total.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the recruits would be: [1, 2, 3, Quinn, Rovero, 6, 7].
  Stanton cannot be recruited immediately before or after Tao, which means that Stanton cannot be the 2nd or the 4th recruit.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruits would be [1, 2, 3, Quinn, Rovero, 6, 7]. Since Peters was recruited fourth, then Stanton cannot be the second recruit. Therefore, Stanton must be the third recruit.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does. The violinist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, and the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the possible order of solos is as follows:
  
  1. Percussionist
  2. Trumpeter or violinist
  3. Violinist or trumpeter
  4. Guitarist or keyboard player
  5. Keyboard player or guitarist
  6. Saxophonist
  
  A: The percussionist does not necessarily perform the first solo.
  B: The percussionist could perform the second solo, but it is not necessarily true.
  C: The violinist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, but it is not necessarily before the saxophonist does.
  D: The percussionist performs a solo before the trumpeter does, but it is not necessarily true.
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist does, so it is not necessarily true that the saxophonist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
  Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform immediately after the percussionist, which means the percussionist does not perform the first solo. Since the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, and the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, the percussionist must perform either the second or the third solo. If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist must perform immediately after the trumpeter, which violates the given conditions. Therefore, the percussionist must perform the third solo. This means that the violinist performs before the saxophonist, so (C) is not necessarily true. However, we know that the percussionist performs before the trumpeter, so (D) must be true. Finally, we do not have enough information to determine whether (A) or (E) is true.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band and each member performs exactly one solo.
  Restrictions:
    1. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
    2. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
    3. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
    4. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does.
  We don't know the exact order of the solos yet.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does. We don't know the exact order of the solos yet, but we do know that the percussionist performs before the saxophonist. Therefore, the percussionist must perform a solo at some time before the trumpeter does. Choice D is the correct answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band and each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the trumpeter does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform a solo before the trumpeter does. This means that option D, "The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does," must be true.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The six-member band consists of a guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, and violinist.
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: 
If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, it means that the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. This eliminates option A and B. 

Option C is not necessarily true because the violinist could perform a solo after the saxophonist does. 

Option D is not necessarily true because the percussionist could perform a solo after the trumpeter does. 

Option E is not necessarily true because the saxophonist could perform a solo after the keyboard player does.

Therefore, the correct answer is None of the Above.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band and each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the trumpeter does. Therefore, the percussionist performs a solo before the trumpeter does. So, D is the correct answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Action: 
  - If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the trumpeter does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform a solo before the trumpeter does.
  - From the given restrictions, we know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo and the keyboard player performs a solo before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform the fourth solo.
  - Also, we know that the percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform the first, second, or third solo.
  - If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the trumpeter does, which is not possible. Therefore, the percussionist does not perform the first solo.
  - If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the trumpeter does, which is possible. Therefore, the percussionist performs the second solo.
  - If the violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the violinist does, which is not possible. Therefore, the violinist does not perform a solo before the saxophonist does.
  - Therefore, the only option that must be true is that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does. Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band, each performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
  - If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  - Therefore, the percussionist must perform a solo before the trumpeter does. 
  - So, the answer is D.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member of the band performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: 
  - If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform the solo after the trumpeter does (because the saxophonist cannot perform a solo after both the percussionist and the trumpeter). 
  - Therefore, the percussionist must perform the first or second solo (because the saxophonist cannot perform the first solo).
  - However, the keyboard player must perform a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform the second solo (because the keyboard player cannot perform the second solo if the percussionist performs the first solo).
  - Thus, the answer is B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the trumpeter does. This is because the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the percussionist performs before the trumpeter or the saxophonist performs after the trumpeter.
  
  A: It is not necessarily true that the percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: It is not necessarily true that the percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: It is not necessarily true that the violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: It is not necessarily true that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: It is not necessarily true that the saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.

The lectures must be given in either Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium, in an order that meets the following conditions: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  - Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  - The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Action: Answer("E") 

If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor. 
According to the given conditions, no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, the other painting on wall 2 must be a painting by a different student. 
Also, no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, the other painting on wall 2 must be a painting by a different student than Hidalgo.
The only watercolor left that has not been used yet is Isaacs's watercolor. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor could also be displayed on wall 2. Thus, the answer is E.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor, in the upper and lower positions.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor, since each wall has exactly one oil and one watercolor. 
  Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, the other painting on wall 2 must be an oil. 
  Since no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, the other oil painting on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's oil. 
  Since no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, the other oil painting on wall 2 cannot be Franz's oil or Isaacs's oil. 
  According to condition 5, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, the other painting on wall 2 must be Greene's oil.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  - If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 (by condition 2).
  - Also, since each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor, and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it (by condition 3), then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 2 with a painting by another student.
  - By condition 4, the other painting on wall 2 cannot be by Franz or Isaacs.
  - By condition 5, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, if Hidalgo's oil is on wall 2, then Franz's oil must be on wall 1 or 3.
  - By condition 6, Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be on wall 1 or 3.
  - Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it (by condition 2), then either Franz's oil or Isaacs's watercolor must be on wall 2 to accompany Hidalgo's oil. Therefore, the answer is either A or E.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor, since no wall can have only oil paintings. Also, since no wall can have only one student's work, the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's watercolor. Additionally, since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs, the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Franz's oil or Isaacs's watercolor. Therefore, the only possible option is Greene's oil, which must be displayed in the lower position of wall 2, since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Franz and Isaacs cannot be on the same wall.
  2. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  3. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  4. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Reasoning:
  - Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2.
  - Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, there must be an oil painting on wall 2.
  - Franz's oil cannot be on wall 2 since Hidalgo's oil is already on wall 2 and no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Therefore, the only option left is Greene's oil, which can be on wall 2 since it is not the work of only one student and it is not in conflict with any of the given conditions.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil, and one watercolor.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  7. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.

We know that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, we know that the other painting on wall 2 must be an oil painting. Also, since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, we know that the other painting on wall 2 must be painted by a student other than Hidalgo. 

We can eliminate choices A, D, and E because they all involve Hidalgo's watercolor, which we don't know where it is displayed. 

We know that no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, we can eliminate choice C because it involves Greene's oil being displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil. 

That leaves us with only one possible answer: 
Action: Answer("B") which is Greene's watercolor.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Franz's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2 because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2 because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, the only option that could also be displayed on wall 2 is Hidalgo's watercolor.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  7. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Using condition 3, we know that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because that would mean only Hidalgo's work is displayed on that wall. Using condition 2, we know that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed in the lower position of wall 2 because that would mean only watercolors are displayed on that wall. Using condition 4, we know that Franz's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2. Using condition 5, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed on the wall with Franz's oil. Therefore, the only option that could be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Using the given conditions, we can deduce that:
- Greene's oil cannot be on wall 2 because it would mean that Franz's oil is also on wall 2, which is not allowed.
- Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 because it would mean that wall 2 has only watercolors displayed on it, which is not allowed.
- Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 because it would mean that Isaacs's oil is also on wall 2, which is not allowed.

Therefore, the only possible painting that could be displayed on wall 2 is Franz's oil.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor are displayed on the same wall.
  2. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  3. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  4. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  5. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  6. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.

Using the given conditions, we can deduce the following:

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then which one of the following could be true of this evening's schedule?
Choices:
  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
Analysis:
  - If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the horror film cannot be shown on that screen because the western begins before the horror film does.
  - Therefore, the horror film must be shown on one of the other two screens.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  - If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1, then the western must be shown on screen 2, and the horror film must be shown on screen 3.
  - If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 2, then the western must be shown on screen 1, and the horror film must be shown on screen 3.
  - In either case, the mystery cannot be shown at 9 P.M. because it would conflict with the horror film, so the mystery must be shown at 7 P.M.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Assumption:
  - The western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen.

Analysis:
  - Since the western begins before the horror film, the western cannot be shown on screen 3.
  - Since the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, the western and the sci-fi film must be shown on screens 1 or 2.
  - Since the romance is not shown on screen 2, the romance must be shown on screen 3.
  - Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, the horror film cannot be shown on screen 2.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screens 1 or 2, then the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 (because the western begins before the horror film), and it cannot be shown on screen 2 (because the mystery is shown on a different screen). Therefore, the horror film must be shown on screen 3. Since the romance is not shown on screen 2, it must be shown on screen 3. Therefore, the mystery must be shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M. This leaves the sci-fi film to be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - There are three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Action: Answer("D")  
If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must begin before the sci-fi film. The only screen that has two movies showing at different times is screen 1. Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 1. This means that screen 2 must have the horror film and the mystery. Since the romance is not shown on screen 2, it must be shown on screen 3. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that the sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M. Answer: D.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must be shown before the sci-fi film. This means that the western cannot be shown on screen 3, since there is only one movie shown on that screen, and it is shown at 8 P.M. Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film must be shown on screens 1 or 2. 

  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2. - This is possible, but it doesn't provide any information about the western or the sci-fi film.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M. - This is possible, since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3. - This is not possible, since the romance is not shown on screen 2 and screen 3 shows only one movie.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M. - This is not possible, since the western must be shown before the sci-fi film.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M. - This is not possible, since the western must begin before the horror film.

  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must be shown before the sci-fi film. This means that the western cannot be shown on screen 3, since there is only one movie shown on that screen, and it is shown at 8 P.M. Therefore, the western must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2. If the western is shown on screen 1, then the horror film must be shown on screen 2, since the horror film is shown on a different screen than the mystery. This means that the mystery must be shown on screen 1, and the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 2. Therefore, the romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 3. This leaves the horror film to be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1. If the western is shown on screen 2, then the horror film must be shown on screen 1, and the mystery must be shown on screen 2. This means that the sci-fi film must be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1, and the romance must be shown on screen 3. Therefore, the mystery must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  There are three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only possible screens are screens 1 and 2. 
  If the western is shown on screen 1, then the horror film must be shown on screen 2, and the mystery must be shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M. This means that the romance must be shown on screen 3 at 8 P.M. Therefore, A, B, and D are not possible. 
  If the western is shown on screen 2, then the horror film must be shown on screen 1, and the mystery must be shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M. This means that the romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. Therefore, C is not possible. 
  The only possible option is E, which states that the western begins at 8 P.M. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must begin before the sci-fi film. Also, the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or 2. This means that the western must also be shown on either screen 1 or 2. Since the romance is not shown on screen 2, it must be shown on screen 1 if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 if the mystery is shown on screen 2. Therefore, the mystery must be shown on screen 1 if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:

  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then they must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  
Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on the same screen, then the romance and the mystery must be shown on the other screen. 
  Since the romance is not shown on screen 2, it must be shown on screen 1. 
  Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, the horror film must be shown on screen 3. 
  Therefore, the mystery must be shown on screen 2. 
  This means that the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1. 
  The western must begin before the horror film, so it cannot begin at 8 P.M. 
  Therefore, the sci-fi film must begin at 7 P.M.

  The band that performs in slot one must be one of the bands that can perform in the first three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The band that performs in slot one must be one of the bands that can perform in one of the first three slots.
  A: Yardsign is the only band that can perform in one of the first three slots, so it could perform in slot one.
  B: Vegemite and Wellspring can perform in slots one, two, or three, but there are no other bands that can perform in the first three slots, so this is not a complete and accurate list.
  C: Vegemite can perform in slots one, two, or three, and Yardsign can perform in slots one, two, or three, but there are no other bands that can perform in the first three slots, so this is not a complete and accurate list.
  D: Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign can perform in slots one, two, or three, but Uneasy can also perform in one of the last three slots, so this is not a complete and accurate list.
  E: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign, and Zircon can perform in slots one, two, or three, but Uneasy can also perform in one of the last three slots, so this is not a complete and accurate list.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find the possible bands that could perform in slot one.
  The order must meet the following constraints:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  According to the constraints given, Yardsign can perform in slot one. 
  Also, Vegemite and Wellspring can perform in slot one because they perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, which means they can perform in slot one or two. 
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of bands that could perform in slot one is Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign. 
  So, the answer is D.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find a list of bands that could perform in slot one, given the constraints.
  Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
Analysis:
  Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, it could be the band that performs in slot one.
  Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, so if Vegemite performs in slot one, Zircon cannot perform in slot one.
  Wellspring and Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so if Wellspring performs in slot one, neither Zircon nor Xpert can perform in slot one.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it cannot perform in slot one.
  
Solution:
  The list of bands that could perform in slot one is: Yardsign.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The band that performs in slot one must be one of the bands that can perform in one of the first three slots.
  A: Yardsign is the only band that can perform in one of the first three slots, so it could perform in slot one.
  B: Vegemite and Wellspring can perform in slots one, two, or three, but this list is not complete because it does not include Yardsign.
  C: Vegemite and Yardsign can perform in slots one, two, or three, but this list is not complete because it does not include Wellspring.
  D: Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign can perform in slots one, two, or three, and this list is complete because it includes all the bands that can perform in one of the first three slots.
  E: This list includes Zircon, which cannot perform in one of the first three slots, so it is not a complete and accurate list of bands that could perform in slot one.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a list of bands that could perform in slot one.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  
Analysis:
  Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, it could be the band that performs in slot one.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so if Zircon does not perform in slot one, Vegemite could perform in slot one.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so if Xpert performs in one of the later slots, Wellspring and Zircon could perform in slot one.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it cannot perform in slot one.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The band that performs in slot one must be one that satisfies the condition that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  The band that performs in slot one must also satisfy the condition that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  The band that performs in slot one can also be one of the bands that satisfies the condition that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  The band that performs in slot one cannot be Uneasy, because Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  
Analysis:
  From the given choices, the only band that satisfies the condition that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots is Yardsign itself. 
  The band that performs in slot one must also satisfy the condition that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, the band that performs in slot one must be either Vegemite or Wellspring.
  However, the band that performs in slot one cannot be Wellspring, because both Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, which means that Xpert must perform in slot one if Wellspring performs in slot one. 
  Therefore, the only possible band that can perform in slot one is Vegemite.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The band that performs in slot one must be one of the bands that can perform in the first three slots.
  A: Yardsign can perform in slot one, but there are other bands that can perform in the first three slots.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Action: Answer("C") 

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf. This means that M and F must also be on the bottom shelf since F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, G and K must be on the top shelf, and I and O must be on the middle shelf. This leaves only H and L to be on the top shelf, so H and L must be placed on the same shelf as each other. Thus, the answer is (C) H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf. This means that M must also be on the bottom shelf (since F is on the same shelf as M). Therefore, G and I must be on the top shelf. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the middle shelf and F must be on the bottom shelf. Finally, O must be on the top shelf. Therefore, the only answer choice that must be true is that H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other (choice C).
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf if L is on the middle shelf, or on the top or middle shelf if L is on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on the same shelf as O, and the answer is E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other. Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  - If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, and there are at least 2 books on each shelf, F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  - Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, K and M must be on the top shelf, and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, O must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, G and H must be on the middle shelf together. 
  A: F and G are not necessarily placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are not necessarily placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are not necessarily placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are not necessarily placed on the same shelf as each other.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
  - I is placed on the middle shelf
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, then K and M must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf and G is the only book left, then G must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, the only option that must be true is that G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other. Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then we know that H is on the bottom shelf and L is on the top or middle shelf.
  - From the given conditions, we know that I is on the middle shelf, so H cannot be on the middle shelf.
  - If H is on the bottom shelf, then G must be on the same shelf as H or on the top shelf. This is because there are at least 2 books on each shelf, and we already know that I is on the middle shelf, so G cannot be on the middle shelf.
  - If G is on the same shelf as H, then A, B, D, and E are all false.
  - If G is on the top shelf, then M and F must also be on the top shelf, which means C is false.
  - Therefore, the answer is A or None of the Above.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and there are only three shelves, F and M must be on the bottom shelf. Thus, G and H must be on the top shelf. Therefore, the answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other. Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, M and F must be on the middle shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, F must also be on the middle shelf. This means that G and O must be on the top shelf. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the bottom shelf. This leaves only H and I to be on the same shelf, which is the middle shelf. Therefore, H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. Answer choice C is correct.
Response 9:

  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf, and L must be on the top or middle shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the middle shelf, so O must be on the top shelf. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf, so K must be on the middle shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, G must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, M and F must be on the top shelf. This means that H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. Thus, the answer is (C) H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.

  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #4, and Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. 
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
  Vaughn can be assigned any of the remaining parking spaces, so the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.

  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analysis:
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. Then, Souza must be assigned parking space #2, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #1. Vaughn can only be assigned parking space #3. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces:
    - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
    
A: Souza is assigned parking space #1.
  If Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Xu must be assigned parking space #2 or higher, which means that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, which contradicts the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, this choice is not true.
B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, which means that Xu must be assigned parking space #3 or higher, and Young must be assigned parking space #4 or higher. This satisfies all the rules and fully and uniquely determines the assignment of parking spaces. Therefore, this choice is true.
C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3.
  If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #1 or #2, which means that Xu must be assigned parking space #4 or higher, and Young must be assigned parking space #5 or higher. This does not satisfy the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, this choice is not true.
D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 or higher, which means that Xu must be assigned parking space #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #3 or lower. This does not satisfy the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, this choice is not true.
E: Xu is assigned parking space #5.
  If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Souza must be assigned parking space #4 or lower, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, which means that Young must be assigned parking space #2 or higher. This does not satisfy the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, this choice is not true.

Solution:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. 
  Therefore, Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. 
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. 
  Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3. 
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. 
  Therefore, Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3, and Xu must be assigned parking space #4, #5, or #6.

  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  - If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6. This is because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Also, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, Souza must be assigned parking space #4, and Vaughn can be assigned any of the remaining parking spaces (#1, #2, or #3). Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces:
    - Young > Togowa
    - Xu > Souza
    - Robertson > Young
    - Robertson ∈ {#1, #2, #3, #4}
    
A: If Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Xu must be assigned parking space #2 or higher, which means that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, which violates the rules.
B: If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, which violates the rules.
C: If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 and Young must be assigned parking space #2, which violates the rules.
D: If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, Young must be assigned parking space #2, Xu must be assigned parking space #3 or higher, and Souza must be assigned parking space #5 or higher, which satisfies all the rules and uniquely determines the assignment of parking spaces.
E: If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1 or #2, which violates the rules.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Choices:
  A: F or else K
  B: F or else M
  C: K or else M
  D: M or else Q
  E: P or else Q
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. If F is not selected, then the panel must include K or M. If F is selected, then the panel must include either K or M, but not both. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is selected, then the panel must include either K or M, but not both. 
  If F is not selected, then the panel must include K or M.
  
  Therefore, the answer must be either A or B. 
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:

  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then at least one of K and M must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. This means that we cannot select only chemists or only zoologists. Therefore, we need to select at least one botanist. If F is selected, we can select at most one zoologist. If F is not selected, we need to select at least one of K and M. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and at least one zoologist.
  
  A: If F is selected, then there will be two botanists selected, which violates the rule that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. If K is selected, then F cannot be selected, which violates the rule that at least one scientist of each type must be selected. Therefore, A is not correct.
  B: If F is selected, then there will be two botanists selected, which violates the rule that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. If M is selected, then P and R must be selected, which violates the rule that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. Therefore, B is not correct.
  C: If K is selected, then F cannot be selected, which violates the rule that at least one scientist of each type must be selected. If M is selected, then P and R must be selected, which violates the rule that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. Therefore, C is not correct.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, the remaining sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey) must work in Zone 3. We also know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so we can eliminate choices A and B. Choice C only includes two sales representatives, so it cannot be correct. Choice D includes three sales representatives, but it includes Tiao, who we know works in Zone 2, so it cannot be correct. Choice E includes all four remaining sales representatives, which is possible given the conditions, so it could be correct.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs seven sales representatives to work in its three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  A: Kim and Mahr cannot both work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  B: Tiao works in Zone 2, so Kim cannot work in Zone 3.
  C: Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot both work in Zone 3.
  D: This is a possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall cannot all work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:

  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  From the given options, we can eliminate options A, B, and C because they do not include more than two sales representatives, and we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We can eliminate option E because it includes all seven sales representatives, which is not possible since there are only three sales zones.

Action: Answer("D") 
Option D includes three sales representatives, which is possible since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The company employs seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so we can eliminate choices A and B, which only have one representative in Zone 3. 
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, neither Parra nor Udall can work in Zone 3, since they are already assigned to Zones 1 and 2. 
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 1 and Quinn is in the same zone, and Tiao is in Zone 2, then the only remaining sales representatives for Zone 3 are Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey. This matches choice D.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:

  - From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, neither Parra nor Udall can work in Zone 3.
  - Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, we know that at least 3 sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  - From the given conditions, we know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot work in different sales zones.
  - From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot work in different sales zones.

  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then it means:
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of peanut butter cookies, OR
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies, OR
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies.

  Let's check each option:
  - If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of peanut butter cookies, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, so (B) is true. Also, there are batches of cookies made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, so (A) is true. Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday, so (E) is false. This leaves us with (C) and (D) to consider.
  - If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, so (B) is true. Also, there are batches of cookies made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, so (A) is true. Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday, so (E) is false. This leaves us with (C) and (D) to consider.
  - If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, so (B) is true. Also, there are batches of cookies made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, so (A) is true. Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday, so (E) is false. This leaves us with (C) and (D) to consider.

  Since (C) and (D) are possible in all three cases, the answer is (E) None of the above.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.

  - We can use this information to determine which statements could be false.
  - If we know that the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, and the third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, then we know that at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. Therefore, statement B could not be false.
  - If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. Therefore, statement C could not be false.
  - If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, then exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. Therefore, statement D could not be false.
  - If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, then at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. Therefore, statement A could not be false.
  - If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. Therefore, statement E could be false.

    * oatmeal 1 and sugar 3
    * peanut butter 1 and oatmeal 3
    * sugar 1 and peanut butter 3
  - We need to find the option that could be false based on these combinations.
  - Option A is true since we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  - Option B is true since we know that there are three batches of each kind of cookie, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  - Option C is false since we know that there are three batches of each kind of cookie, and at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so there must be more than one batch of cookies made on Monday.
  - Option D is true since we know that there are three batches of each kind of cookie, and each batch is made on a different day of the week, so exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  - Option E is true since we know that there are three batches of each kind of cookie, and each batch is made on a different day of the week, so exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?
Choices:
  A: Quinn
  B: Ruiz
  C: Verma
  D: Wells
  E: Xue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three workers, and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, the constraints involving Smith and Taylor do not apply. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, the project leader must be either Quinn or Wells. 
  Since Taylor is not a project member, the only way to satisfy the constraint involving Wells is to select Wells as the project leader. 
  Therefore, the project leader is Wells, and the two other project members must be selected from the remaining workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Verma, and Xue. 
  Since Quinn and Ruiz can be project members only if leading the project, they cannot be selected. 
  Therefore, the only possible project members are Smith, Verma, and Xue. 
  Answer: Answer("C") Verma must be a project member.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members.
  One of the members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Action: Answer("A") 

Explanation:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member either (because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be). Therefore, we have to select three project members from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, we cannot select Wells. If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, they must be the project leader. Therefore, we cannot select Ruiz (because if Ruiz is a project member, he must be the project leader, but he cannot be a project member if Wells is a project member). Therefore, we have to select Quinn as the project leader if he is a project member. Therefore, we have to select Quinn and two other workers from Verma and Xue. Therefore, the answer is A: Quinn.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" does not apply.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. 
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Wells cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader, and the third project member must be either Smith, Verma, or Xue.
  Since Verma cannot be a project member if Wells is a project member, and Wells cannot be a project member if Taylor is not a project member, then Verma must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member either because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, the three project members must be selected from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, the three project members must be selected from Quinn, Wells, Smith, Taylor, and Xue. Since exactly one of the project members will be the leader, and Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, Quinn and Ruiz cannot be project members. Therefore, the three project members must be selected from Wells, Smith, Taylor, and Xue. 
  If Verma is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be a project member. Therefore, the three project members must be selected from Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Xue. However, Quinn cannot be a project member because Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, and Quinn cannot be the leader since exactly one of the project members will be the leader. Therefore, the three project members must be selected from Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  If Xue is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be a project member. Therefore, the three project members must be selected from Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Xue. However, Quinn cannot be a project member because Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, and Quinn cannot be the leader since exactly one of the project members will be the leader. Therefore, the three project members must be selected from Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  Therefore, the only worker who must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member is Smith.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, the constraint that Taylor must be a project member if Smith is a project member is not applicable. 

If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Wells cannot be a project member. 

Therefore, the three project members must be selected from the group {Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, Xue}. Since Wells cannot be a project member, the three project members must be selected from the group {Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Xue}. 

If either Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then that person must be the project leader. Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then either Verma or Xue must be a project member. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members, one of whom will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member either, because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Thus, the three project members must be selected from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, so the three project members must be Wells, Xue, and one of Quinn or Ruiz. But Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project, so one of Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader. Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz, and the other two project members must be Wells and Xue.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member either. Therefore, the project must consist of three members from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, they must be the project leader. Therefore, only one of them can be selected.
  If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Therefore, Xue must be selected to complete the project.
  If Wells is not selected, then either Ruiz or Verma must be selected. However, only one of them can be selected as the project leader. Therefore, Xue must be selected to complete the project.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, the three project members must be selected from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue. 

If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be the project leader. 

If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, that person must be the project leader. Therefore, if Quinn or Ruiz is selected, the project leader is determined, and the remaining two project members must be selected from the remaining four workers: Verma, Wells, Xue, and either Smith or Taylor. 

If neither Quinn nor Ruiz is selected, then the project leader must be one of the three remaining workers: Verma, Wells, or Xue. Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member, and the three project members must be selected from the remaining four workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, and Wells. 

In this case, if Verma is not a project member, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member and the project leader, which is not possible because Taylor is not a project member. Therefore, Verma must be a project member. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members, and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member either, because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, the three project members must be selected from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Quinn, Xue, and Wells must be the project members, and Wells must be the project leader.
  
  If Wells is not a project member, then either Ruiz or Verma must be a project member. However, Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, and Wells cannot be the project leader. Therefore, Xue must be the project leader, and the project members must be Xue, Quinn, and Verma.
  
  In either case, Verma must be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members, and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, the constraint that Taylor must be a project member if Smith is a project member is not applicable.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader.
  If Quinn is the project leader, then Ruiz cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then either Quinn or Wells must be a project member.

  - Each band will perform in just one slot.
  - The order must meet the following constraints:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then we know that:
    - Yardsign cannot perform in slot one or two because they must perform in one of the first three slots.
    - Zircon must perform in slot six because Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring must perform in slot four or five because Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six because Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, if Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot three, and Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Yardsign. So, Wellspring must perform in slot one or two, which means that Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Thus, the correct answer is D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
  A: We cannot determine the relationship between Uneasy and Xpert based on the given information.
  B: If Wellspring performs in slot one or two, then this statement is true. However, we cannot determine the exact slot of Wellspring based on the given information.
  C: We cannot determine the relationship between Xpert and Uneasy based on the given information.
  D: If Yardsign performs in slot one or two, then this statement is true. However, we cannot determine the exact slot of Yardsign based on the given information.
  E: This statement is true based on the given information.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—will perform in six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot five or six.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot five or six. Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Zircon must perform in slot five or six, then Wellspring must perform in slot four, and Xpert must perform in slot six. Therefore, Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  Since Vegemite performs in slot three, we know that the first two slots must be filled by Yardsign and Wellspring, in some order. We also know that Zircon cannot perform in slot three, so it must perform in slot four, five, or six. This means that Xpert must perform in slot six, and Uneasy must perform in slot four or five. 
  
  A: We cannot conclude this from the given information.
  B: We know that Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, but we cannot conclude that it performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  C: We know that Xpert performs in slot six, which is a later slot than slot three, where Vegemite performs. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
  D: We know that Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Xpert, but we cannot conclude that Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
  E: We know that Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite, but we cannot conclude that Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  According to the constraints, we know that Zircon will perform in a slot later than Vegemite. Therefore, Zircon will perform in slot four, five, or six. Since Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, Wellspring will perform in slot three as Vegemite is already in slot three. This means that Xpert will perform in slot six, and Uneasy will perform in slot four or five. Yardsign will perform in slot one, two, or three.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  Since Vegemite performs in slot three, we know that Yardsign cannot perform in slot one or two, so it must perform in slot three. This means that Uneasy cannot perform in slot three, four, or five, so it must perform in slot six. Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Zircon cannot perform in slot three, then Wellspring must perform in slot one and Zircon in slot two. 

A: We cannot determine this from the given information.
B: True, since Wellspring performs in slot one and Zircon in slot two.
C: We cannot determine this from the given information.
D: We cannot determine this from the given information.
E: False, since Uneasy performs in slot six, which is later than Zircon's slot two.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Process:
  Since Vegemite performs in slot three, we can deduce that:
  - Yardsign cannot perform in slot one or two, because it must perform in one of the first three slots.
  - Zircon cannot perform in slot three, because Vegemite is already performing in that slot.
  - Uneasy cannot perform in slot one or two, because Yardsign cannot perform in those slots.
  - Xpert cannot perform in slot six, because Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Wellspring cannot perform in slot six, because Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
  
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is:
  B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—will fill the six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  - From the given constraints, we know that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot three.
  - Also, Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, Xpert cannot perform in slot three.
  - So, the possible bands that can perform in slot three are Uneasy and Yardsign.
  - But, Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot three.
  - Hence, Yardsign must perform in slot three. 
  - Therefore, Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring. So, the answer is D.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  According to the information given, Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot three. Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, Xpert cannot perform in slot three either. This means that Uneasy must perform in slot three, and Yardsign must perform in slot one or two. Since Uneasy performs in slot three, it is not possible for Xpert to perform in an earlier slot than Uneasy. Therefore, the answer is not C. Since Zircon cannot perform in slot three, it is not possible for Zircon to perform in an earlier slot than Uneasy. Therefore, the answer is not E. Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, it is possible for Wellspring to perform in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, the answer is B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  Since Vegemite performs in slot three, Yardsign cannot perform in slot one or two. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot three. This means that Uneasy must perform in one of the last two slots. Since Zircon performs after Vegemite, Zircon must perform in slot four, and Wellspring must perform in slot five. Xpert must perform in slot six. 

A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert. - False
B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon - False
C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy - True
D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring - False

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must have been recruited last. 
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Tao could not have been recruited sixth. 
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas could not have been recruited sixth either.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn could not have been recruited first.
  That leaves us with the option that Rovero was recruited third and Stanton was recruited second.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is: [_, _, _, Peters, _, _, _]
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is: [_, _, _, Peters, _, Villas, White]
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is: [_, _, White, Peters, Rovero, _, Tao]
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited first.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited second or sixth.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The only option that fits the order of recruitment is that Tao was recruited sixth.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.

Analysis:
  From the given information, we know that Peters was recruited fourth, and Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, the order of recruitment must be: Quinn, (unknown), (unknown), Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao.
  Since White was recruited earlier than Rovero, we know that Rovero must be recruited either sixth or seventh. If Rovero was recruited sixth, then Tao must be recruited last, which is not possible because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, Rovero must be recruited seventh, and Tao must be recruited sixth. 
  Now, we have the order of recruitment as: Quinn, (unknown), (unknown), Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao. 
  Since Quinn was recruited before Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth, we can conclude that Quinn must be recruited first. 
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Tao was recruited sixth.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Peters was recruited fourth.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  We know that White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao. Therefore, Tao must have been recruited either 6th or 7th. Peters was recruited fourth, so Tao could not have been recruited earlier than 6th. Therefore, Tao was recruited 6th or 7th. 
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited 5th. 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn could not have been recruited first. Therefore, Quinn was recruited either 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton could not have been recruited 2nd or 7th. Therefore, Stanton was recruited either 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Choice B is possible. Rovero was recruited third.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of the last three recruits is Tao, Rovero, and White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the first four recruits is Quinn, Villas, Stanton, and Peters.
  - Therefore, Tao, Rovero, and White must be the last three recruits, and their order is Rovero, White, and Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be the first recruit.
  - Therefore, the order of the recruits is Quinn, Villas, Stanton, Peters, Rovero, White, and Tao.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then White > Rovero > Tao.
  
Analysis:
  If White > Rovero > Tao, then Quinn cannot be recruited first because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. 
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Quinn cannot be recruited second. 
  If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then Villas cannot be recruited sixth. 
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited second. 
  Therefore, Tao was recruited sixth.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  
Analysis:
  We know that Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, Rovero, and Tao.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, Rovero, and Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so the order of recruitment is Peters, Quinn, X, Y, Villas, White, Rovero, and Tao.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Quinn, Stanton, Villas, White, Rovero, and Tao.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Peters was recruited fourth.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  6. White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.

To determine the order of recruitment, we can use the following information:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment must start with Quinn, Villas, and White.
  2. Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment must be Quinn, Villas, White, and three more accomplices.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so the order of recruitment must be Quinn, Villas, White, Quinn's successor, Rovero, and two more accomplices.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so the order of recruitment must be Quinn, Villas, White, Quinn's successor, Rovero, Tao's predecessor, Stanton, and Tao.

Using this information, we can determine which of the following could be true:
A: Quinn was recruited first. - False, Quinn was recruited second.
B: Rovero was recruited third. - False, Rovero was recruited fifth.
C: Stanton was recruited second. - False, Stanton was recruited seventh.
D: Tao was recruited sixth. - True, Tao was recruited sixth.
E: Villas was recruited sixth. - False, Villas was recruited second.

  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment must be: Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton, Tao.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited first, Peters was recruited second, Villas was recruited third, White was recruited fourth, Rovero was recruited fifth, Stanton was recruited sixth, and Tao was recruited seventh.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The only option that is consistent with the established order of recruitment is that Tao was recruited sixth.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the first three recruits must be Quinn, Rovero, and Villas (in some order).
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White must have been recruited fifth.
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must have been recruited last. 
  - Therefore, the order of the first six recruits must be Quinn, Rovero, Villas, Peters, White, and Stanton (in some order).
  - Since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, and Tao was recruited last, then Stanton must have been recruited second.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - Since there are at least 2 books on each shelf, and I is on the middle shelf, there must be at least 2 books on the top and bottom shelves.
  - Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the top shelf must have 2 books and the bottom shelf must have 3 books.
  - Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, they must both be on the top or bottom shelf together.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - The bottom shelf has 3 books, and it cannot have K or O.
  - F and M cannot be on the top shelf because there are only 2 books on the top shelf.
  - Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf together.
  - The remaining book on the bottom shelf must be H.
  - The top shelf has G and L.
  - The middle shelf has I and K. 
  - Thus, the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf is F, H, and M, which is option B.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - There are exactly 8 books.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  
Using the given conditions, we can deduce that:
  - There are at least 3 books on the bottom shelf.
  - There are at most 2 books on the top shelf.
  - Since F and M are on the same shelf, they must both be on the top or middle shelf.
  - Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf, so the top and bottom shelves must have at least 1 book each.
  
Option A is not possible because there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf.
Option B is not possible because H is not on the same shelf as F and M.
Option C is not possible because none of the books listed are on the bottom shelf.
Option D is possible because F and M can be on the bottom shelf, and G and O can be on the top shelf.
Option E is not possible because none of the books listed are on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  - Choice A cannot be correct because it only has two books on the bottom shelf, and the prompt states that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - Choice B cannot be correct because it has three books on the bottom shelf, but the prompt states that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - Choice C cannot be correct because it does not include any of the books that are known to be on the middle shelf (I) or the same shelf as F (M).
  - Choice D cannot be correct because it includes O on the bottom shelf, but the prompt states that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - Choice E could be correct because it includes four books on the bottom shelf (G, H, L, M), which is more than the number of books on the top shelf. It also includes I on the middle shelf and K on a higher shelf than F.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  - Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is not.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is not.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  From the analysis, we know that the bottom shelf must have at least three books, and F and M must be on the same shelf. The only option that satisfies these conditions is D: F, G, M, O.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  A: F and M are on the same shelf, so this cannot be the bottom shelf.
  B: F and M are on the same shelf, so this cannot be the bottom shelf.
  C: K is not on the bottom shelf, so this cannot be the bottom shelf.
  D: This is a possible arrangement for the books on the shelves. F and M are on the same shelf, and G and O are not on the bottom shelf.

  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  A: F, M are on the same shelf and there should be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. So, this option is not possible.
  B: F, H, M are on the same shelf and there should be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. So, this option is not possible.
  C: G, H, K are not on the bottom shelf because K is placed on a higher shelf than F. So, this option is not possible.
  D: F, G, M, O are on different shelves and there should be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. So, this option is possible.
  E: G, H, L, M are not on the bottom shelf because F and M are on the same shelf. So, this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
  - I is placed on the middle shelf
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M
  
Analysis:
  - Since I is on the middle shelf, it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  - Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, they must be on the same shelf.
  - Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  - Therefore, the only possible answer is B: F, H, M

Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P— that will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season. Choice D states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This is equivalent to the original condition because it also means that M and N cannot be published in the same season. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This condition is not related to the condition given in the question.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This condition is not related to the condition given in the question.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This condition is not related to the condition given in the question.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This condition is equivalent to the given condition, as it establishes a relationship between the publication of N and M.
  E: If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This condition is not related to the condition given in the question.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
Option D has the same effect as the original condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. It means that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This is because K and N must be published in the same season as each other, and if K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring to satisfy the condition that K and N must be published in the same season as each other.

  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
  - Choice A is not correct because it does not mention anything about cookbook N, which is the one that is affected by cookbook M.
  - Choice B is not correct because it mentions cookbook P, which is not related to the condition that needs to be substituted.
  - Choice C is not correct because it mentions cookbook P, which is not related to the condition that needs to be substituted.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each of the four walls has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we can deduce the following:
  - Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 4.
  - Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1 or wall 3 because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 4 because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Hidalgo's oil and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1 and wall 3 in some order.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor, in upper and lower positions.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  
Reasoning: 
  - Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 2.
  - Since no wall can have only watercolors, wall 2 must have one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  - Since no wall can have only one student's work, wall 2 must have paintings by two different students.
  - Since wall 2 already has Isaacs's watercolor, it cannot have Isaacs's oil. Therefore, wall 2 must have one painting by Isaacs and one painting by another student.
  - Since Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3 and no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs, wall 3 cannot have Isaacs's watercolor. Therefore, wall 3 must have one painting by Franz and one painting by another student.
  - Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of that wall (wall 3).
  - Therefore, wall 1 must have one painting by Greene and one painting by Hidalgo.
  - Since no wall can have only watercolors, wall 1 must have one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each of the four walls will have exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Using the given information, we can deduce that:
  - Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1 because that would mean both of Franz's paintings would also have to be on wall 1, which violates condition 4.
  - Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1 because that would mean both of Isaacs's paintings would have to be on wall 1, which violates condition 4.
  - Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1 because that would mean all of Hidalgo's paintings would have to be on wall 1, which violates condition 3.
  
Therefore, the only possible option is Greene's oil, which satisfies all of the given conditions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are four walls, and each wall has one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position, for a total of 8 paintings.
  - Each of the four students has one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we can deduce that:
  - Isaacs's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 4.
  - Greene's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 4, since it cannot be displayed on wall 3 (where Franz's oil is displayed).
  - Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on walls 2 and 3.
  
  Therefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is:
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The exhibition room has four walls, and each wall has two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Each of the 4 walls has exactly 2 paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall can have only watercolors.
  3. No wall can have only one student's work.
  4. No wall can have both Franz's and Isaacs's work.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we know that Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 4. However, we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1. Therefore, the only option left is that Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1. This satisfies all the given conditions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the four walls will have exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on walls 1 and 4.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's oil or watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Each student displays exactly two paintings - an oil and a watercolor.
  2. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room, with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C") 

If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 1. 
This is because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, and Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1. 
Also, no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, so Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1. 
Since no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, and Franz and Isaacs are already displayed on walls 2 and 3 respectively, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the four art students will display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning: 
  - If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we know that Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 3, and Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2. 
  - We also know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 3.
  - Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, we know that wall 2 must have at least one oil painting. Since Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, we know that Isaacs's oil must be displayed on either wall 1, 3, or 4.
  - Since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, we know that the oil painting displayed on wall 1 cannot be painted by Isaacs or Franz.
  - Since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, we know that the oil painting displayed on wall 1 cannot be painted by Hidalgo.
  - Therefore, the only option left is Greene's oil.

Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  - If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then George must give his report on Tuesday, and Nina and Robert must give their reports on Monday and Wednesday in some order.
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George must give his report on Tuesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on the next day.
  - Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so she can only give a report on Monday morning.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - George gives a report only on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Six students give reports over three consecutive days.
  
Analysis:
  - George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another.
  - Since George gives a report only on Tuesday, Nina and Robert cannot give reports on Tuesday.
  - If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday, because then Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible.
  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving will give reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
  - So, Robert will give a report on Monday and Olivia will give a report on Tuesday.

  A: Helen can only give a report on Monday or Wednesday. If Helen gives a report on Wednesday, then Nina's report must be given on Monday, which is not possible since George must give a report on Tuesday.
  B: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George must give a report on Tuesday.
  C: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. George can give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia can give a report on Monday. Robert cannot give a report on Wednesday since he cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, this is a possible scenario.
  D: If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then Robert cannot give a report on Wednesday since he cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, this is not possible.
  E: If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then George must give a report on Tuesday and Nina cannot give a report since Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day. Therefore, this is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another.
  
  A: Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday because if George gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen must give a report on Wednesday if Nina doesn't give a report on Tuesday.
  B: Nina cannot give a report on Monday because if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible because George must give a report on Tuesday.
  C: Nina can give a report on Tuesday, which means Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  D: Olivia cannot give a report on Monday because Robert must give a report on Monday and he cannot give an afternoon report.
  E: Robert can give a report on Wednesday because George and Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  1. George must give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give reports in the morning.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Monday, because there would be no next day for Helen and Irving to give reports. So, if Nina gives a report, it must be on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  4. If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then George must give a report on Tuesday, and Nina and Robert must give reports on Monday and Wednesday, but we don't know which one gives a report on which day.

Analysis:
  1. George must give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must both give reports in the morning.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday, because that would mean that Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George must give a report on Tuesday.
  4. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday, which means that Lenore and Kyle must give reports on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert must give reports on Wednesday. This scenario satisfies the conditions of the problem.

  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six reports will be given during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  1. George must give his report on Tuesday.
  2. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday, because then Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George must give his report on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Wednesday.
  3. Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so he must give his report in the morning. Therefore, Robert must give his report on Monday.
  4. Since George, Nina, and Robert have already given their reports, the only students left to give reports are Helen, Irving, and Olivia.
  5. If Helen gives a report on Wednesday, then Irving must also give a report on Wednesday, which is not possible since Nina is giving her report on Wednesday. Therefore, Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - There are only three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then there will be only one possible way to assign the remaining reports to the other students.
  - If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday because there will be no one to give a report with on Tuesday.
  - If Robert gives a report on Monday, then there will be no one left to give a report with George on Tuesday.
  - If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then there will be no one left to give a report with Robert on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then the only way to assign the remaining reports is:
  - Monday: Helen and Irving
  - Tuesday: George and Lenore
  - Wednesday: Nina and Olivia
  Therefore, Helen gives a report on Wednesday. Choice A is correct.

Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.

  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have three members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The project will have 3 members and 1 leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be a project member, which means that Wells cannot be a project member either. This leaves only Verma and Xue as potential project members, but it is not clear who the leader will be, so the selection is not completely determined. Therefore, option A is not correct.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which means that the only potential project members are Verma, Wells, and Xue. However, it is not clear who the leader will be, so the selection is not completely determined. Therefore, option B is not correct.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the potential project members are Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Wells. However, if Ruiz is not selected, then he cannot be the leader, which means that Quinn must be the leader. This leaves only Smith, Taylor, and Quinn as project members, with Quinn as the leader. Therefore, option C is correct.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the potential project members are Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Xue. However, it is not clear who the leader will be, so the selection is not completely determined. Therefore, option D is not correct.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the potential project members are Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue. However, if Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members. This means that the only potential project members are Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue, with Wells as the leader. Therefore, option E is not correct.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three workers will be selected for the project.
  Exactly one of the project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Analysis:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor must not be selected, which means that the project leader cannot be selected. Therefore, this choice cannot be correct.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected, which means that the project leader cannot be selected. Therefore, this choice cannot be correct.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells. However, if Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected, which means that only two workers can be selected for the project. Therefore, this choice cannot be correct.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the project leader must be Quinn or Ruiz, which means that either Quinn or Ruiz must be selected for the project. Therefore, this choice cannot be correct.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the project leader can be any of the workers except for Wells. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if this choice is true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have 3 members and 1 leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis: 
  To determine the answer, we can go through each option and see if the selection is completely determined or not. If it is, then that is our answer. If not, we can eliminate that option and move on to the next one.

  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. 
    If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then there are 5 workers left to choose from. Since Quinn can only be a project member if leading the project, and Smith must be selected with Taylor, this means that there are only 2 possible configurations for the project: 
    1. Quinn, Taylor, and Wells with Quinn as the leader
    2. Ruiz, Taylor, and Wells with Ruiz as the leader
    Therefore, the selection is not completely determined. 

  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
    If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then there are 5 workers left to choose from. Since Quinn can only be a project member if leading the project, this means that there are only 2 possible configurations for the project: 
    1. Smith, Wells, and Xue with Smith as the leader
    2. Ruiz, Wells, and Xue with Ruiz as the leader
    Therefore, the selection is not completely determined. 

  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
    If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then there are 5 workers left to choose from. Since Quinn can only be a project member if leading the project, this means that there are only 2 possible configurations for the project: 
    1. Smith, Taylor, and Wells with Smith as the leader
    2. Smith, Taylor, and Verma with Smith as the leader
    Therefore, the selection is not completely determined. 

  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
    If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then there are 5 workers left to choose from. Since Wells cannot be selected with Ruiz or Verma, this means that there are only 2 possible configurations for the project: 
    1. Quinn, Smith, and Taylor with Quinn as the leader
    2. Quinn, Smith, and Xue with Quinn as the leader
    Therefore, the selection is completely determined. 

  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
    If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then there are 5 workers left to choose from. Since Wells cannot be selected with Ruiz or Verma, this means that there are only 2 possible configurations for the project: 
    1. Quinn, Smith, and Taylor with Quinn as the leader
    2. Quinn, Smith, and Xue with Quinn as the leader
    Therefore, the selection is completely determined. 

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Quinn can be selected as the project leader and project member along with Smith and Taylor. This satisfies all the constraints. However, if any of the other options were selected, there would still be multiple possibilities for the selection that satisfy the constraints.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The project will have 3 members and 1 project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. This does not determine the selection because there are still other workers to consider.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected. This does not determine the selection because there are still other workers to consider.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected. This does not determine the selection because there are still other workers to consider.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected. This determines the selection because if Wells is not selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Therefore, the only possible project members are Smith, Taylor, and Xue, and one of them will be the project leader.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The company has 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - The sales representatives work in 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that zone, since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Parra and Quinn must work in another sales zone together, since they work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, so the other one must work in Zone 3.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, so the other one must work in Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so at least 3 sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must work in the same sales zone as well. 
  From the given conditions, we know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Since Udall works in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey, it means that Tiao cannot work in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 1. 
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Since Tiao works in Zone 1, it means that Parra cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Parra must work in Zone 3. 
  From the given conditions, we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Kim cannot work in Zone 2. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must work in the same sales zone as well. 
  This means that there are at least three sales representatives in that sales zone, which must be Zone 3. 
  Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3, so Parra works in Zone 1. 
  This means that Tiao works in Zone 2 and Kim works in Zone 3. 
  Since Parra is in Zone 1, Quinn must also be in Zone 1. 
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then it is possible that Stuckey works in Zone 2. This is because we know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, and Udall could work in Zone 2 (since either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2). Therefore, D is a possible scenario.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that same sales zone because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, there are at least three sales representatives in that sales zone. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3. 
  
  A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there are fewer sales representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1, which is not possible because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Quinn cannot work in Zone 3 because Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey can work in Zone 2, but this contradicts the premise that Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
  E: Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.

  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must work in the same sales zone as well. This is because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, there are at least three sales representatives working in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3. 
  
  A: Kim works in Zone 2. - This cannot be true, since Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1. - This cannot be true, since Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. - This could be true, since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. - This cannot be true, since Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3.

  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Parra and Quinn must also work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  Also, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that Mahr and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 2.
  
  A: Kim works in Zone 2. This is possible, but it does not provide any information about whether Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1. This is not possible because Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. This is possible, but it does not provide any information about whether Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. This is not possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Mahr and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 2.

Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If X is mentioned in chapter 1, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  There are seven chapters: chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, because X and W cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 3, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.

Action: Answer("B") 
Therefore, if X is mentioned in chapter 1, R could be mentioned in chapter 7.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  We need to find the possible locations of R, S, T, U, W, and Z in the seven chapters of the mystery novel.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 2, then X must be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 3.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If W is not mentioned in chapter 2, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If S is mentioned in chapter n, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter n-1 or chapter n+1.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter n, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter n-1 or chapter n+1.
Action: 
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. This eliminates choices (A) and (E).
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. This eliminates choice (D).
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later. This eliminates choice (B).
  This leaves us with choice (C) as a possible option. Therefore, Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The novel consists of seven chapters, and each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then:
- U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
- W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
- If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, which is not possible because there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
- Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
- If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later, which is possible.
- If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later, which is possible.
- If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7, which is not possible because there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
- If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3, which is possible.
- If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later, which is possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - By the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, we know that X is mentioned in chapter 1 and U is mentioned in chapter 2.
  - By the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, we know that W is not mentioned in chapter 2.
  - By the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, we know that T is not mentioned in chapter 1.
  - By the constraint that T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, we know that T is mentioned in either chapter 2 or chapter 3, and W is mentioned in either chapter 5 or chapter 6.
  - By the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, we know that S is not mentioned in chapter 1, and Z is not mentioned in chapter 2.
  
Action: 
  - The only choice that is consistent with the constraints is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. Therefore, Answer("D").
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.

  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - According to the constraint, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  - Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 6.
  - According to the constraint, T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 6.
  - According to the constraint, S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - Therefore, S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and chapter 2, or chapter 2 and chapter 3, or chapter 6 and chapter 7.
  - According to the constraint, R must be mentioned in one of the remaining chapters.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, if X is mentioned in chapter 1, it is possible that W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then:
- U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
- W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so it must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if T is mentioned in chapter 2, then S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 3 and 4, or in chapters 4 and 5, or in chapters 5 and 6, or in chapters 6 and 7.
- If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then R must be mentioned in chapter 7.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. (Not possible because R must be mentioned in chapter 7 if T is mentioned in chapter 2.)
B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. (Possible if T is mentioned in chapter 2.)
C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. (Not possible because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.)
D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. (Possible if T is mentioned in chapter 2.)
E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3. (Not possible because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.)

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each chapter must contain exactly one clue.
  - T cannot be in chapter 1.
  - T must be before W, and there must be exactly two chapters between T and W.
  - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
  
If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then:
- U must be in chapter 2.
- W cannot be in chapter 2, so it must be in chapter 5 or later.
- T must be in chapter 4 or later, and W must be two chapters after T. Therefore, T must be in chapter 4 and W must be in chapter 6.
- S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters, so neither can be in chapter 2 or chapter 4. Therefore, S and Z must be in chapters 3, 5, or 7.
- R is the only remaining clue, so it must be in the remaining chapter.

Analysis:
- A: R cannot be in chapter 3 because U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
- B: R cannot be in chapter 7 because it is the only chapter remaining, and R cannot be adjacent to S or Z.
- C: S cannot be in chapter 2 because it is adjacent to U and X.
- D: W must be in chapter 6, so this is a possible arrangement.
- E: Z cannot be in chapter 3 because it is adjacent to S.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then:
- U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
- W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 (because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters).
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 (because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W).
- Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2.
- Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.

Checking the choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. This is possible, because R can be mentioned in any chapter except chapter 1 and chapter 7.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. This is not possible, because R cannot be mentioned in chapter 7 if X is mentioned in chapter 1.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. This is not possible, because S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 if X is mentioned in chapter 1.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. This is possible, because W must be mentioned after T, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W can be mentioned in chapter 6, and if T is mentioned in chapter 5, then W can be mentioned in chapter 7.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3. This is not possible, because Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 if X is mentioned in chapter 1.

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The novel consists of seven chapters, and each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if X is mentioned in chapter 1, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 7.
  - R can be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 7.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, if X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6. So, the correct answer is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The novel consists of seven chapters, and each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  
Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, the only possible options for chapter 2 are U, S, or Z. However, S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, U must be mentioned in chapter 2, and S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 1, 2, or 3. 
  Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and X is mentioned in chapter 1, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, and it must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later. 
  Since W cannot be mentioned in an adjacent chapter to X, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 6. 
  Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and U is mentioned in chapter 2, S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 1, and S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 4 and 5, in some order. 
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.

Knowledge: 
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  Each section must have exactly two photographs.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then:
  - Gagnon has two photographs in that section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  - Therefore, Gagnon's photographs must be in either the Lifestyle or Metro section.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - Therefore, if Gagnon's photographs are in the Lifestyle section, then there must be at least one photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section in the Lifestyle section as well.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Two photographs per section, so a total of six photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be either 1 or 2. According to the condition, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. So, Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must also be either 1 or 2. Since there are only two photographers left, Fuentes and Hue, to fill the remaining two spots in the Lifestyle section, it follows that both photographs in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Hue. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Answer("E").
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are six different photographs in total, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue. According to the condition, the Lifestyle section must have at least one photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Metro section, either Fuentes or Hue must have both photographs in the Metro section. However, since Gagnon already has both photographs in one of the sections, neither Fuentes nor Hue can have both photographs in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, both photographs in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue. This satisfies the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Thus, the answer is E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are six different photographs in total, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue. According to the constraint, the Lifestyle section must have at least one photograph by Fuentes or Hue. However, if both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then there would be three photographs by Hue in total, which is not allowed. Therefore, the Lifestyle section must have one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue. Finally, in the Metro section, there cannot be two photographs by Fuentes or two photographs by Hue. Therefore, both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes or Hue. Thus, the only possible option is that both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. This means that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E") 

If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then it means that Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, Fuentes and Hue must have one photograph each in the Sports section. According to the constraint, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, Hue must have one photograph in the Lifestyle section. Also, at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, Fuentes must have one photograph in the Metro section. This leaves Hue with one photograph in the Metro section. Thus, the only option that could be true is that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Therefore, the answer is E.

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue. According to the conditions, the Lifestyle section must have a photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Metro section, the Lifestyle section must have at least one photograph by either Fuentes or Hue. However, we know that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, then one photograph in the Sports section must also be by Fuentes. This violates the condition that the Sports section must have one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue. Therefore, both photographs in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue. This leaves only one photograph by Fuentes for the Sports section, which means that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Thus, the answer is E.
Response 6:

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then:
  - Gagnon has two photographs in that section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  - Therefore, both photographs in the other two sections must include at least one photograph by Gagnon.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Gagnon or Fuentes, and one photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon or Hue.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. Not possible, as at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. Possible, as one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Gagnon or Fuentes, and the other photograph in the Lifestyle section can be by Hue. 
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. Not possible, as one photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon or Hue.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue. Possible, as one photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon or Hue, and the other photograph in the Metro section can be by Fuentes.

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be either 1 or 2. According to the condition, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Thus, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must also be either 1 or 2. If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must also be 2. However, this would violate the condition that each photographer can have at most 3 photographs in total. Therefore, only one photograph in the Sports section can be by Hue. This means that the other photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes. Since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, both photographs in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Hue. Thus, the only option that could be true is that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Therefore, the answer is E.

  - Therefore, both photographs in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Gagnon.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and the other photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.

Therefore, the Sports section must have one photograph by Fuentes and one photograph by Hue. According to the constraint, the Lifestyle section must have at least one photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since Gagnon has both photographs in the Metro section, the Lifestyle section cannot have both photographs by Hue. Therefore, option A is not possible. Similarly, option C is not possible because Fuentes cannot have both photographs in the Metro section. Option D is not possible because Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Option B is possible, but it is not the only possible option. Therefore, the correct answer is option E, which says that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  2. If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  3. The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  4. The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - From condition 1, the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd to June 6th.
  - From condition 2, if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because there is no antique to be auctioned before it.
  - From condition 4, the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because there is no antique to be auctioned after it.
  - From condition 3, the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the mirror and the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because there is no antique to be auctioned before them.
  
Action: Answer("B") - The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica must be auctioned after the lamp if the mirror is auctioned after the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
  - June 1st: Not the sundial.
  - June 2nd: Either the harmonica or the lamp must be auctioned. If the lamp is auctioned, then the mirror must also be auctioned. The sundial is not auctioned. The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.
  - June 3rd: Either the harmonica or the lamp must be auctioned. If the lamp is auctioned, then the mirror must also be auctioned. The sundial is not auctioned. The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the vase cannot be auctioned on June 3rd.
  - June 4th: The sundial must be auctioned. The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 4th.
  - June 5th: Either the harmonica or the lamp must be auctioned. If the lamp is auctioned, then the mirror must also be auctioned. The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the vase cannot be auctioned on June 5th.
  - June 6th: The remaining item must be auctioned.

Action: Answer("D")  
The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. This means that the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the vase must be auctioned on June 6th, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: Based on the analysis, the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, and the only option that satisfies this condition is B, which says that the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. Therefore, B could be true.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Action: 
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  We also know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st. This means that the harmonica must also be auctioned on June 1st.
  Now we can determine the remaining auction dates. The table must be auctioned on June 3rd, and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th. This leaves the lamp to be auctioned on June 5th and the only remaining antique, the lamp, to be auctioned on June 6th.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both. So, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, then the harmonica and the vase cannot be auctioned on those days. So, the table must be auctioned on June 3rd. Therefore, the harmonica or the vase must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.

Action: Answer("D") - The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are six antiques to be auctioned: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
  - The auctions will take place on six consecutive days: June 1st through June 6th.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - From the given conditions, we can deduce that the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd or later.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. This means that the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or earlier, because if it were, then the harmonica would have to be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror would have to be auctioned on June 2nd or earlier, which violates the given condition.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both. This means that the table cannot be auctioned on June 6th, because if it were, then both the harmonica and the vase would have to be auctioned on June 6th, which violates the given condition.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, the lamp could be auctioned on June 3rd, which is consistent with the given conditions.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six antiques to be auctioned: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
  - The auction takes place over six consecutive days: June 1st through June 6th.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp. This means that the harmonica, mirror, and lamp must be auctioned consecutively in that order.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  - The vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, because the table must be auctioned before it. This means that the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - The mirror must be auctioned before the vase, so it cannot be auctioned on June 6th.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: Based on the analysis, the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd, since it follows the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 5th, since it must be before the vase. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Six antiques (harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase) are auctioned, one per day, for six consecutive days (June 1st through June 6th).
  - Conditions:
    - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.

    - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
    - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
Action: 
  - Option A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. 
    - According to the second condition, if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the table must be auctioned on June 2nd, which violates the third condition. Therefore, the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, and the mirror must also be auctioned on June 2nd. This option is possible. 
    - Option A is a possible answer.
  - Option B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - According to the second condition, if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 2nd, which violates the third condition. Therefore, the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned on June 2nd. This means that the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, violating the first condition. 
    - Option B is not a possible answer.
  - Option C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - According to the third condition, the sundial must be auctioned before the vase. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd. According to the second condition, if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd. This means that the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, violating the fourth condition. 
    - Option C is not a possible answer.
  - Option D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
    - According to the second condition, if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 2nd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd. This option is possible. 
    - Option D is a possible answer.
  - Option E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
    - According to the second condition, if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the table must be auctioned on June 2nd, which violates the third condition. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 2nd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd. This means that the vase cannot be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, violating the fourth condition. 
    - Option E is not a possible answer.
    
Therefore, the possible answers are A and D. However, we cannot determine which one is correct without more information.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp for the mirror to be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd because the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd. The vase is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, so it cannot be auctioned on June 2nd. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. The mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, so it cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. 

Action: Answer("E")  
Based on the given conditions, the only option that could be true is that the mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
- The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
- The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
- The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
- The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
- If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd or later. This means the lamp, the mirror, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st. However, this violates the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 2nd.
- If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This means the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the lamp and the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This satisfies all the conditions.

Action: Answer("B") - The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays

  - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Solution:
  - Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. Therefore, Frost and Heideck cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony alone.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony alone.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, Knutson cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony alone.
  - If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. Therefore, Lai and Mays cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony together.
  - From the above constraints, we can conclude that the only possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony is Frost, Gonzalez, and Knutson.

  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies, so Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to either Silva or Thorne University ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Gonzalez cannot be assigned to Silva University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, so Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies, so either Lai or Mays can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, but not both.

Solution:
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to either Silva or Thorne University ceremony. So, Frost and Heideck can be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Gonzalez cannot be assigned to Silva University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, so Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies, so either Lai or Mays can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, but not both.
  Therefore, the only valid assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony is Frost, Knutson, and Lai.

Analysis:
  We need to find an assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony that satisfies all the given constraints.
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies, so they cannot be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, so Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies, so at most one of them can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.

Solution:
  From the analysis above, we know that Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, and Frost and Heideck cannot be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, the only possible assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony is:
  Frost, Gonzalez, Lai
  Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:

  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  We need to find a valid assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies, so Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the same ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We have six photographers available, but not all have to be assigned.

Solution:
  We need to find an assignment that satisfies the given constraints and includes at least two photographers for the Silva University ceremony.
  From the constraints, we know that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, so they will be assigned to the same ceremony. 
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. 
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We can try different combinations of photographers to see which one satisfies the constraints and includes at least two photographers for the Silva University ceremony.
  Let's try each option:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson - This assignment violates the constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together.
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck - This assignment satisfies the constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, but it does not include at least two photographers for the Silva University ceremony.
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson - This assignment does not include Frost, Heideck, Lai, or Mays, so it cannot be a valid assignment.
  D: Heideck, Lai - This assignment violates the constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together.
  E: Knutson, Mays - This assignment satisfies the constraint that Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. It also satisfies the constraint that if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, this assignment is valid. However, it does not include Frost, so it does not include all the available photographers.

  The only valid assignment that includes at least two photographers for the Silva University ceremony is E: Knutson, Mays.
Action: Answer("E")

  The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  We need to find a possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony, so they cannot be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need at least two photographers for the Silva University ceremony, so we can eliminate option C and E.
  Option A includes Knutson, who cannot be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so we can eliminate it.
  Option B includes Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck, which satisfies all the constraints and is a possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  Option D includes Heideck and Lai, but we need at least two photographers for the Silva University ceremony, so we can eliminate it.

Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be: 
  1. Unknown
  2. Tao
  3. Unknown
  4. Peters
  5. Unknown
  6. Unknown
  7. Unknown
  
  A: If Quinn was recruited third, then the order would be: Unknown, Tao, Quinn, Peters, Unknown, Unknown, Unknown. This is possible.
  B: If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order would be: Unknown, Tao, Unknown, Peters, Unknown, Rovero, Unknown. This is possible.
  C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order would be: Unknown, Tao, Unknown, Peters, Unknown, Stanton, Unknown. This is possible.
  D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order would be: Unknown, Tao, Unknown, Peters, Unknown, Villas, White. This is not possible because Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  E: If White was recruited third, then the order would be: Unknown, Tao, White, Peters, Unknown, Unknown, Unknown. This is not possible because Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - If Tao was recruited second, then there are only two possible positions for Tao in the order of recruitment: either second or seventh.
  
Analysis:
  - If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited third. Therefore, Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Villas was recruited immediately before White. 
  - If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then White must have been recruited seventh. 
  - Since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, and Peters was recruited fourth, the only possible position for Stanton is sixth. 
  - Therefore, the only possible position for Rovero is fifth.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Therefore, if Tao was recruited second, Rovero was recruited fifth.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis: 
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first. 
  Since Peters was recruited fourth, then Tao must have been recruited after Peters, which means Tao was recruited second or third. 
  If Tao was recruited second, then Quinn was recruited third, and Rovero was recruited fifth. 
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas and White must have been recruited sixth and seventh, respectively. 
  This leaves Stanton as the only option for the sixth spot. 
  Therefore, the answer is C: Stanton was recruited sixth.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is as follows:
  1- Tao
  2- Accomplice X
  3- Accomplice Y
  4- Peters
  5- Accomplice Z
  6- Accomplice W
  7- White
  The possible orders of recruitment for the remaining accomplices are:
  Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Villas
  Rovero, Quinn, Stanton, Villas
  Quinn, Stanton, Rovero, Villas
  Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas
  Villas, Quinn, Stanton, Rovero
  Villas, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero
  
Action: Answer("B")  
  If Tao was recruited second, then Rovero could have been recruited fifth. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

  1. The first recruit
  2. Tao
  3. The third recruit
  4. Peters
  5. The fifth recruit
  6. The sixth recruit
  7. Villas
  8. White

A: If Tao was recruited second, then Quinn cannot be recruited third because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, A is not true.
B: If Tao was recruited second, then Rovero cannot be recruited fifth because Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, B is not true.
C: If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton cannot be recruited sixth because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, C is not true.
D: If Tao was recruited second, then Villas can be recruited sixth because Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, D could be true.
E: If Tao was recruited second, then White cannot be recruited third because Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, E is not true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters must have been recruited third.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited fifth and White must have been recruited sixth.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited first or second.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must have been recruited either first or seventh.
  
  A: If Quinn was recruited third, then Peters would have been recruited fourth, which is not possible since Peters was recruited fourth.
  B: If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Stanton would have been recruited sixth, which is not possible since Stanton was recruited either first or seventh.
  C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Tao would have been recruited fifth, which is not possible since Peters was recruited fourth.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
  1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then we know that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days. We also know that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day. This also means that Truvest's voicemail target must be 1 day, since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Finally, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, which means that Image's voicemail target must be 1 day and its website target must be 2 days.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has two targets: one for website and one for voicemail.
  - Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  - Image has two targets: one for website and one for voicemail.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide has two targets: one for website and one for voicemail.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  
  Based on the given information, we can infer that Truvest's voicemail target must be longer than its website target. This means that Truvest's voicemail target is at least 2 days. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, Solide's website target must be 1 day. This also means that Truvest's website target must be 2 days. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Truvest's voicemail target is at least 2 days, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. Since None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must be 1 day.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Truvest has a website target and a voicemail target.
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is 1 day and its voicemail target is 2 days.
- Image has a website target and a voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis:
- If Truvest's website target is 1 day and its voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day (because it must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets).
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which means Solide's website target must also be 1 day.
- Therefore, Image's website target cannot be 1 day, so options C and E are eliminated.
- Image's voicemail target is 1 day, so option A is eliminated.
- The only option left is B, which says that Image's website target is 2 days. This is possible because Image's website target can be longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company sets two service targets for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days. 

Analysis:
  - If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's website target must also be 2 days or shorter. However, this contradicts the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, A is not true.
  - If Image's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day, which contradicts the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, B is not true.
  - If Image's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be 1 day, which satisfies the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, C could be true.
  - If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be 2 days or longer, which contradicts the given information that Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target. Therefore, D is not true.
  - If Solide's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's website target must be 2 days, which satisfies the given information that Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target. Therefore, E could be true.

  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's voicemail target must be at least 2 days. This is because the shortest website target is 1 day, and none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Truvest's voicemail target must be at least 2 days, which means that Image's voicemail target must also be 2 days since it must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which means that Solide's website target must be 1 day.

Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles is: Q, R, S, G, H, J, Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be Q, R, S.
  The order of the last three articles must be G, H, J.
  Therefore, the possible order of the articles is: Q, R, S, G, H, J, Y.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: If Y is fourth, then J must be third, because J must be earlier than G, and G must be after S, which is the third article. Therefore, J must be third.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - G, H, and J are finance articles.
  - Q, R, and S are nutrition articles.
  - Y is a wildlife article.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles must be one of the following:
  1. S _ _ Y _ _ _
  2. _ S _ Y _ _ _
  3. _ _ S Y _ _ _
  
  In all three cases, J must be first or second, and G must be second or third. Q must be third in case 1, and R must be seventh in case 2. None of the articles can be first or fourth.
  
  A: J cannot be second if G is third.
  B: J must be first or second, so it is possible that J is third.
  C: Q cannot be first if S is earlier than Q.
  D: Q must be third in case 1, so it is possible that Q is third.
  E: R must be seventh in case 2, so it is possible that R is seventh.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles is subject to the following conditions:
  1. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  2. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  3. S must be earlier than Y.
  4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
If Y is fourth, the order of the articles could be: 
  1. G
  2. Q
  3. R
  4. Y
  5. H
  6. S
  7. J

A: J cannot be second because G must be earlier than R.
B: J cannot be third because G must be earlier than J.
C: Q cannot be first because S must be earlier than Y.
D: Q can be third, according to condition 2.
E: R cannot be seventh because G must be earlier than R.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  - Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  - One article covers wildlife: Y.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  - If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be Q, R, and S.
  - Since S must be earlier than Y, then S must be first, Q must be second, and R must be third.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, J cannot be fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh. It must be either first, second, or third.
  - Since consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, H cannot be second, and G cannot be third.
  - Therefore, the only possible order for the articles is: S, Q, R, Y, G, H, J.
  - J is sixth, so it cannot be second.
  
Action: Answer("B") - J is third.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the articles is: Q, R, S, G, H, J, Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be Q, R, S. 
  Therefore, the order of the last four articles is G, H, J, Y.
  
  A: J cannot be second because S must be earlier than Y, and J must be after G.
  B: J must be third, because G must be earlier than R and the order of the last four articles is G, H, J, Y.
  C: Q cannot be first because S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  D: Q cannot be third because the order of the first three articles is Q, R, S.
  E: R cannot be seventh because the order of the last four articles is G, H, J, Y and G must be earlier than R.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - G, H, and J cover finance.
  - Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  - Y covers wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be Q, R, S. This is because S must be earlier than Y, and S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, the order of the first four articles is Q, R, S, Y. 
  
  We know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, J must be either first or second. If J is first, then the order of the first four articles is J, Q, R, S, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. Therefore, J must be second. 
  
  The remaining articles, G and H, can be in any order as long as they are after J and before R. Therefore, there are two possible orders for the last three articles: G, H, R or H, G, R. 
  
  A: J is second. This is true.
  B: J is third. This is false.
  C: Q is first. This is false.
  D: Q is third. This is true.
  E: R is seventh. This is false.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The articles are divided into three groups: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be either QRS or RSQ.
  
Analysis:
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be either QRS or RSQ. 
  If Q is first, then the order of the first three articles must be QRS, which means that S is earlier than Q, which violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, Q cannot be first.
  If Q is second, then the order of the first three articles must be RSQ, which means that S is earlier than Y, which violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, Q cannot be second.
  If Q is third, then the order of the first three articles must be SQR, which satisfies all the conditions. Then, the order of the remaining articles must be GJHR, which also satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q must be third.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The articles are divided into three groups: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be either finance-nutrition-nutrition or nutrition-finance-nutrition.
  
Analysis:
  If Y is fourth, then the first three articles must be either finance-nutrition-nutrition or nutrition-finance-nutrition. 
  If the first three articles are finance-nutrition-nutrition, then G must be first, Q must be third, and S must be second. This violates the rule that S must be earlier than Q. Therefore, finance-nutrition-nutrition is not possible.
  If the first three articles are nutrition-finance-nutrition, then Q must be first or third. If Q is first, then S must be second, which violates the rule that S must be earlier than Q. Therefore, Q must be third. This means that S must be first and R must be second. Then, G must be fourth, J must be fifth, and H must be sixth. Therefore, J is fifth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - G, H, and J cover finance.
  - Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  - Y covers wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles must be one of the following:
1. Q, R, S, Y, G, H, J
2. R, Q, S, Y, G, H, J
3. S, Q, R, Y, G, H, J

A: J cannot be second in any of the possible orders because J must be earlier than G.
B: J can only be third in the third possible order.
C: Q cannot be first in any of the possible orders because S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
D: Q can only be third in the third possible order.
E: R must be sixth in all possible orders because G must be earlier than R.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the articles must be: Q, R, S, G, H, J, Y.
  If Y is fourth, then Q, R, and S must be first, second, and third in some order.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?
Choices:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
  C: the western, the horror film
  D: the western, the mystery
  E: the western, the sci-fi film
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies showing at the repertory theater: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  The schedule has three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  Since screen 1 shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M., and the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, we know that the horror film and the mystery cannot both be shown on screen 1. Therefore, options A, B, and C are possible lists of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1. 
  The western must be shown on screen 1 or 2, and since the romance is not shown on screen 2, it must be shown on screen 1. Therefore, option E is also a possible list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1.
  The only remaining option is D, which lists the western and the mystery as the two movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1. However, we know that the western must be shown before the horror film, and since the horror film is not shown on screen 2, it must be shown on screen 1. Therefore, the western and the horror film must be shown on screen 1, and the mystery cannot be shown on screen 1. Thus, option D is NOT an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  - Since screen 1 shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M., the movie shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1 cannot be the same as the movie shown at 7 P.M. on screen 2.
  - The western must be shown before the horror film, so the western cannot be the 9 P.M. movie on screen 1 or 2.
  - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or 2.
  - The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 3.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M., then the mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M. because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, option B cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  - According to the given conditions, the western must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2, and it must be shown before the horror film.
  - Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, the mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 with the horror film.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2.
  - Therefore, the only possible combinations for screen 1 are: 
    - the western and the romance (7 P.M. and 9 P.M.)
    - the sci-fi film and the mystery (7 P.M. and 9 P.M.)
  - None of the given options match these combinations, so the answer is: Answer("E") the western, the sci-fi film.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  There are three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  Since screen 1 shows two movies, and the romance is not shown on screen 2, the romance must be shown on screen 1. 
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so neither of them can be shown on screen 1.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does, so the western cannot be shown second on screen 1, because the horror film would have to be shown first.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  Therefore, the only possible accurate lists of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 are:
  1. the romance, the mystery
  2. the romance, the sci-fi film
  3. the western, the romance

Action: Answer("A")

Elimination:
  A: The western must be shown before the horror film, so this is not possible.

  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Elimination:
  We know that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, we can eliminate choices B and D because they both have the sci-fi film and the mystery on screen 1.
  We also know that the romance is not shown on screen 2. Therefore, we can eliminate choice A because it has the sci-fi film and the horror film on screen 1, and choice E because it has the western and the sci-fi film on screen 1.
  Choice C has the western and the horror film on screen 1, which is possible because the western begins before the horror film.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be on screen 1. 
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it cannot be paired with the sci-fi film on screen 1. 
  The western must be on screen 1 or 2, and it must be paired with either the sci-fi film or the horror film. 
  Choice A is possible because the western could be on screen 2 and the sci-fi film and horror film could be on screen 1. 
  Choice B is possible because the western could be on screen 1 and the mystery and sci-fi film could be on screen 2. 
  Choice C is possible because the western could be on screen 1 and the horror film could be on screen 2. 
  Choice D is possible because the western could be on screen 2 and the mystery could be on screen 1. 
  Choice E is not possible because the western cannot be on screen 3 and the sci-fi film cannot be on screen 2. 
  Therefore, the answer is E. Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  - Since screen 1 shows two movies, and the romance is not shown on screen 2, the romance must be shown on screen 1.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so neither of them can be shown with the romance on screen 1.
  - The western begins before the horror film does, so the western cannot be shown with the horror film on screen 1.
  - Therefore, the only movie that can be shown with the romance on screen 1 is the sci-fi film.
  - Since the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, it must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  - The horror film cannot be shown with the romance on screen 1, so it must be shown on screen 2 with the mystery.
  - The western must be shown before the horror film, so it cannot be shown on screen 2 with the horror film.
  - Therefore, the western must be shown on screen 1 with the sci-fi film, and the mystery must be shown on screen 2 with the horror film.
  - So, the accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first, is: the western, the sci-fi film.
  - Therefore, the answer that CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first, is E: the western, the sci-fi film.
  
Action: Answer("E")

  B: The sci-fi film and the mystery are listed in the correct order.
  C: The western and the horror film are listed in the correct order.

  - If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there will be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 1. Therefore, this statement could be true.
  - If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there will be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 1. Therefore, this statement could be true.
  - If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there will be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 1. Therefore, this statement could be true.
  - If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, this would contradict the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, this statement must be false.

  - Choice D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This is possible, but not required by the conditions.
  - Choice E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. This is impossible, because Parra and Quinn must work in the same zone, and Parra cannot work in Zone 1 with Tiao. Therefore, Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 2 or Zone 3, and Stuckey cannot work in Zone 1 or Zone 2 with Udall. Therefore, Stuckey must work in the same zone as Parra and Quinn, which is either Zone 2 or Zone 3.

D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This is possible, and it is consistent with the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, this statement is not false.
E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is not possible because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, this statement must be false.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:

  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Explanation: 
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 2, and the other must work in Zone 3. This means that there are only two sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, A must be false.
Response 7:

Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 2, and the other one must work in Zone 3. This would mean that there are only two sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, it is not possible for Kim and Stuckey both to work in Zone 1.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The company employs exactly seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.

  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 and Kim and Stuckey are not excluded from working in the same zone.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 and Mahr and Stuckey are not excluded from working in the same zone.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 and Mahr and Udall are not excluded from working in the same zone.

Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies.
- Each breed of kitten and each breed of puppy is featured exactly once on each of the seven consecutive days.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Since there are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies, there are a total of 6 breeds.
- Each breed must be featured exactly once on each of the seven consecutive days.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on any other day that Himalayans are not featured.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, so they cannot be featured on any other day that Rottweilers are not featured.
- Since no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days, the breeds must alternate.
- Since any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, the breeds on day 1 and day 7 must be different.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies.
  - Each breed of kitten and puppy is featured exactly once on each of the 7 days.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
Analysis:
  - Since there are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies, there are a total of 9 different breeds. Each breed is featured exactly once on each of the 7 days, so each breed is featured on exactly 3 days.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so any breed that is featured on the same days as Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1.
  - Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so any breed that is featured on the same days as Himalayans cannot be featured on day 7 or on any day that features Rottweilers.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
  - Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not. This is possible because Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 or on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, on the days that Himalayans are not featured, Rottweilers could be featured.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies.
  - Each breed of kitten and puppy is featured exactly once on each of the seven consecutive days.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, then there must be one breed that is featured on only one day, which violates the condition that each breed is featured exactly once on each of the seven consecutive days. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans must be featured on day 1, which violates the condition that Himalayans are not featured on day 1. Therefore, B cannot be true.
C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Greyhounds must be featured on day 4, which violates the condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, C cannot be true.
D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Rottweilers must be featured on day 1, which violates the condition that Greyhounds are featured on day 1. Therefore, D cannot be true.
E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Himalayans cannot be featured on days 2, 3, and 4, which means they can only be featured on days 5, 6, and 7. This satisfies the condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, and the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, the answer is E.

- Since there are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies, there are 9 possible combinations of kitten and puppy breeds.
- Since there are 7 days, each combination of kitten and puppy breeds must be featured exactly once.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so any combination that does not include Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 1.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, so any combination that includes a breed featured on day 1 cannot be featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, so any combination that includes Himalayans must be featured on days 2-6.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, so any combination that includes Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7 or on any day that features Himalayans.

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
- Since any combination that includes Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans, it is possible that Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
- This is consistent with the given conditions and does not violate any of the rules.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies.
  - Each breed of kitten and puppy is featured exactly once on each of the 7 consecutive days.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.

  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, then there must be one breed that is featured on only one day, violating the condition that each breed is featured exactly once on each of the 7 consecutive days. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans would have to be featured on day 1, which violates the condition that Himalayans are not featured on day 1. Therefore, B cannot be true.
C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Greyhounds would have to be featured on all three days that Himalayans are featured, which violates the condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, C cannot be true.
D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans would have to be featured on days 2, 3, 4, and 5, which satisfies the condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days and not on day 1. Also, Rottweilers are not featured on any of these days, which satisfies the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, D could be true.
E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers would have to be featured on days 2, 3, 4, and 5, which violates the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on day 7. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Analysis:
- Since there are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies, there are a total of 6 breeds. Each breed must be featured exactly once a day for 7 consecutive days, so each breed must be featured exactly 7 times.
- Since no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days, each breed must be featured on days that are separated by at least one day.
- Since any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, and Greyhounds are featured on day 1, Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7.
- Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, and not on day 1, they must be featured on days 2-4, 5-7, or 2-4 and 6.
- Since Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, they must be featured on days 2-4, 5, or 6.

  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the voicemail targets can be 1 day, 2 days, or a combination of 1 day and 2 days. However, the website targets must be shorter than the voicemail targets, so the website targets can only be 1 day or 2 days.
  
Analysis:
  A: Image's website target can be 1 day, but it can also be 2 days if its voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so it can only be 1 day. This statement is true.
  C: Solide's voicemail target can be 1 day or 2 days, but it cannot be longer than Truvest's voicemail target. This statement is true.
  D: Truvest's website target can be 2 days, but it can also be 1 day if its voicemail target is 1 day.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target can be 1 day or 2 days, but it cannot be longer than Solide's voicemail target. This statement is true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
- The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be either 1 day or 2 days. However, we don't know anything about Image's website target, so it could be 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Image's website target is 1 day, so (A) is the answer. On the other hand, we can conclude that Solide's website target is 2 days because it must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which cannot be 1 day because Truvest's voicemail target cannot be 3 days. We can also conclude that Solide's voicemail target is 2 days because it cannot be 3 days and it cannot be shorter than Image's voicemail target. Finally, we can conclude that Truvest's website target is 2 days because it cannot be 1 day and it must be longer than Solide's website target. We can also conclude that Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days because it cannot be 3 days and it must be longer than Image's voicemail target.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company sets two service targets for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then it means that the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
  
Analysis:
  A: It is possible that Image's website target is 1 day, as it is not affected by the condition that none of the clients can have a voicemail target of 3 days.
  B: Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target could be 2 days, so it is possible that Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then it means that the longest voicemail target is 2 days. Therefore, it is possible that Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  D: Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so it is not possible that Truvest's website target is 2 days if Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then it means that the longest voicemail target is 2 days. Therefore, it is possible that Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A") 

Explanation: 
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, it means that the longest voicemail target is 2 days. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. Therefore, Image's website target must also be 1 day because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target must be 2 days and Truvest's website target must be 3 days. Therefore, the statement "Image's website target is 1 day" must be true. The other statements are consistent with the given conditions.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, it means that the maximum voicemail target is 2 days.
  
Analysis:
  A: If Image's website target is 1 day, then Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 1 day, which contradicts the given condition that none of the clients can have a voicemail target of 3 days. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be longer than 2 days, which contradicts the given condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, then Truvest's voicemail target must be longer than 2 days, which contradicts the given condition that none of the clients can have a voicemail target of 3 days. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be shorter than 2 days, which satisfies the given condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, D is true.
  E: If Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days, which satisfies the given condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, E is true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then it means that the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
  
Analysis:
  - If Image's website target is 1 day, then it is shorter than its voicemail target, which is at most 2 days. This satisfies the first condition.
  - If Solide's website target is 2 days, then it is shorter than Truvest's website target, which is at least 2 days. This satisfies the third condition.
  - If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, then it is not longer than its website target, which is at most 2 days. This satisfies the first condition.
  - If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then it is longer than Solide's website target, which is at most 2 days. This violates the third condition.
  - If Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then it is shorter than Image's voicemail target, which is at most 2 days. This satisfies the second condition.

  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target is 1 day.
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Solide's voicemail target is 2 days or less.
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days or less.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target is 1 day. This means that Image's website target cannot be 1 day because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Image's website target cannot be 1 day, which means that choice A is the exception and is not necessarily true.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the voicemail targets can be 1 day, 2 days, or both 1 day and 2 days. However, the website targets must be shorter than or equal to the voicemail targets. 

Analysis:
  A: If Image's website target is 1 day, then it is shorter than its voicemail target, which can be 1 day or 2 days. This is consistent with the given conditions. 
  B: If Solide's website target is 2 days, then it is shorter than Truvest's website target, which can be 1 day or 2 days. This is consistent with the given conditions. 
  C: If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, then its website target can be 2 days or 3 days. This is consistent with the given conditions. 
  D: If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then its voicemail target can be 1 day or 2 days. This is consistent with the given conditions. 
  E: If Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then its website target can be 2 days or 3 days. This is consistent with the given conditions.

  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
  
Analysis:
  A: If Image's website target is 1 day, then its voicemail target must be shorter than 1 day, which is not possible since the longest voicemail target is 2 days. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be longer than 2 days, which is not possible since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: Solide's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days, since the longest voicemail target is 2 days. Therefore, C can be true.
  D: If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be shorter than 2 days, which is possible since Solide's website target can be either 1 day or 2 days. Therefore, D can be true.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days, since the longest voicemail target is 2 days. Therefore, E can be true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The maintenance company sets two service targets for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
- The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be either 1 day or 2 days. If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then Solide's and Truvest's voicemail targets must be 2 days or longer, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must also be 1 day. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target must be 2 days and Truvest's website target must be 3 days. Therefore, the only statement that is not necessarily true is A: Image's website target is 1 day. It could be 2 days if Image's voicemail target is 1 day. Statements B, C, D, and E are all necessarily true based on the given information.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) has to have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - Fuentes must have at least one more photograph in the Sports section.
  - Hue must have at least one more photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, which means that either Fuentes or Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  A: If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then Fuentes would have at least three photographs in total, which violates the condition that each photographer can have at most three photographs. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then either Fuentes or Hue must have all three photographs in the Lifestyle section, which violates the condition that each photographer can have at most three photographs. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue is possible. In this case, the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes, and the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Gagnon. Then, Fuentes has two photographs in the Sports section, and Hue has two photographs in the Lifestyle section. This satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, C is true.
  D: If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then Fuentes would have to have all three photographs in the Lifestyle section, which violates the condition that each photographer can have at most three photographs. Therefore, D is not true.
  E: If neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue, then Fuentes would have to have all three photographs in the Sports section, which violates the condition that each photographer can have at most three photographs. Therefore, E is not true.
  
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that there are no photographs by Gagnon in the Lifestyle section. We also know that there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. This means that the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes or Hue must be accompanied by a photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes or Gagnon. Therefore, we can eliminate choices B, C, D, and E. The only remaining option is A, which states that both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This is possible because Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and there are no restrictions on the number of Fuentes' photographs that can appear in any section. 

Answer: Answer("A")

  - There is one photograph left for the Lifestyle section.
  - There are two photographs left for the Metro section, and one of them must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - There are two photographs left for the Sports section, and one of them must be by Fuentes and the other by Hue.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. (Not possible because one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.)
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. (Not possible because one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.)
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. (Possible. One photograph in the Metro section can be by Hue, and the other photograph can be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.)

  - Since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and there are no photographs in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon, then at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  - If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there are no photographs in the Sports section by Fuentes, which contradicts the condition that the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  - If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then there are no photographs in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon, which contradicts the condition that for each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - If exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes, which satisfies the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and also satisfies the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This is not possible because there must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. This is not possible because there are only three photographers and each photographer can have at most three photographs in total.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is possible. It means that the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Gagnon. Also, the other photograph by Hue must be in the Sports section, which means that there must be at least one photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section as well.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that there are no photographs in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon. Therefore, at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue. If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there would be no photographs by Fuentes in the Sports section, which would violate the condition that the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section is the same as the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, option A is not possible. Similarly, option B is not possible because none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Option D is not possible because it violates the condition that the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the only possible option is C, which states that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Six photographs will appear in total, exactly two photographs per section (in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections).
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Analysis:
  - If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there are two possibilities for the third photograph in the Lifestyle section: it is either by Gagnon or by either Fuentes or Hue.
  - If the third photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon, then there will be no photographs by Gagnon in the Metro or Sports sections, which violates the condition that at least one but no more than three of each photographer's photographs must appear.
  - Therefore, the third photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  - If the third photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, then there must be one photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section. This means that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must also be one, and therefore there can be at most two photographs by Hue in the Metro section. This means that both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes, so option A is not possible.
  - If the third photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue, then the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must also be one. This means that there can be at most two photographs by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section, and therefore there can be at most one photograph by Hue in the Metro section. This means that option C is possible.
  - Option B is not possible because it violates the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - Option D is not possible because it violates the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - Option E is not possible because there must be at least one photograph by Hue in either the Lifestyle or Metro section.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs: two in Lifestyle, two in Metro, and two in Sports.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs.
  - At least one photograph in Lifestyle must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in Sports.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in Sports.
  - One photograph in Lifestyle is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  
  A: There are only two photographs in the Metro section. If both are by Fuentes, then Fuentes will have three photographs in total, which is not allowed. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  B: There are only two photographs in the Metro section. If both are by Gagnon, then Gagnon will have two photographs in total, which is allowed. Therefore, this could be true.
  C: If one photograph in Lifestyle is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, and at least one photograph in Lifestyle must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro, then the other photograph in Lifestyle must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro. If exactly one photograph in Metro section is by Hue, then the other photograph in Metro section must be by Fuentes or Gagnon. However, Fuentes already has a photograph in Lifestyle, so the other photograph in Metro section cannot be by Fuentes. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  D: The number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in Sports. If one photograph in Lifestyle is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle is 1 and the number of Fuentes photographs in Sports is 1. Therefore, this could be true.
  E: None of Gagnon's photographs can be in Sports. If both photographs in Sports section are not by Hue, then Fuentes must have two photographs in Sports, which is not allowed. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- There are six photographs, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is because there are only three photographers and at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, if Fuentes and Hue have photographs in the Lifestyle section, then Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. If Gagnon has one photograph in the Metro section, then it is possible that the other photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six different photographs, exactly two photographs per section in Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - There are no photographs in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon.
  - There is at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Hue.
  - There is at least one photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes.
  - There is at least one photograph in the Metro section by either Gagnon or Hue.
  - There is at least one photograph in the Sports section by Fuentes.
  - There is at least one photograph in the Sports section by either Gagnon or Hue.
  
Analysis:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This is not possible because there must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by either Gagnon or Hue.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. This is not possible because there must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is possible. If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there is at least one photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes, and the other photograph in the Metro section can be by either Gagnon or Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. This is not possible because there must be at least one photograph in the Sports section by either Gagnon or Hue.

  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. This does not provide any information about Mollie's assignment or the assignment of the other students.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. This means that Louis cannot be assigned to 1923, so Louis must be assigned to 1924. Since Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and 1922 is the only available year, Mollie must be assigned to 1922. This also means that Ryan must be assigned to the project, and Onyx must be assigned to 1921.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Analysis:
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then the remaining years (1922, 1923, and 1924) must be assigned to Louis/Tiffany, Tiffany/Louis, and Ryan/Onyx, respectively. This means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922, which contradicts the given condition that Ryan's year must be immediately prior to Onyx's year.
- Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
- If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then the remaining years (1921, 1923, and 1924) must be assigned to Louis/Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx, respectively. This assignment satisfies all the given conditions.

- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Analysis:
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then the remaining years (1922, 1923, and 1924) will be assigned to Louis/Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx, respectively.
- If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then the remaining years (1921, 1923, and 1924) will be assigned to Louis/Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx, respectively.
- If Mollie is assigned to 1923 or 1924, then there will be no valid assignment for the remaining years.

Action: Answer("B")  
If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922, and the remaining years (1923 and 1924) will be assigned to Louis/Tiffany and Ryan, respectively, satisfying all the conditions.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  There are four years to be assigned, and each year must have exactly one student assigned to it.
  
Analysis:
  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then the remaining years must be assigned to Louis/Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx, respectively. However, this is not possible because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds the cargo with the lowest number.
  Bay 6 holds the cargo with the highest number.
  Grain > Livestock
  Livestock > Textiles
  Produce > Fuel
  Textiles is next to Produce
  There are six types of cargo: Fuel, Grain, Livestock, Machinery, Produce, and Textiles.
  
  If Bay 4 is holding Produce, then we know that:
  - Bay 5 is holding Textiles
  - Bay 3 is holding Fuel
  - Bay 2 cannot be holding Livestock or Grain because that would violate the given rules.
  - Therefore, Bay 2 must be holding Livestock or Grain.
  - Bay 1 cannot be holding Produce or Textiles because that would violate the given rules.
  - Therefore, Bay 1 must be holding Fuel, Grain, Livestock, Machinery, or Textiles.
  - Bay 6 cannot be holding Produce or Textiles because that would violate the given rule.
  - Therefore, Bay 6 must be holding Fuel, Grain, Livestock, Machinery, or Textiles.
  
  We know the cargo type for Bays 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, the type of cargo for all six bays is completely determined.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then:
  - The bay holding textiles is either bay 3 or bay 5.
  - The bay holding fuel is either bay 1 or bay 2.
  - The bay holding grain is either bay 6 or one of the bays 1 through 3.
  - The bay holding livestock is either bay 5 or one of the bays 1 through 4.
  Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 is not completely determined.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  From the given information, we can determine the following:
  Bay 4 is holding produce, so bay 3 must be holding textiles.
  Bay 2 must be holding fuel, and bay 1 must be holding livestock.
  Bay 6 must be holding grain, and bay 5 must be holding machinery.
  Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1 through 4 is completely determined, and the type of cargo for bays 5 and 6 is also completely determined. So, the answer is 4.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds the cargo with the lowest number.
  Bay 6 holds the cargo with the highest number.
  Bay holding grain > Bay holding livestock
  Bay holding livestock > Bay holding textiles
  Bay holding produce > Bay holding fuel
  Bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then:
  - Bay 5 cannot hold textiles (because textiles is next to produce).
  - Bay 6 cannot hold produce (because produce is already in bay 4).
  - Bay 1 cannot hold fuel (because produce is higher than fuel).
  - Bay 2 cannot hold livestock (because livestock is lower than textiles).
  Therefore, bay 3 must hold livestock and bay 5 must hold textiles.
  
  We know that there are six bays and six types of cargo, so each bay must hold a unique type of cargo.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  From the given information, we know that:
  - Bay 4 is holding produce.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel (so the bay holding fuel must be one of bays 1, 2, or 3).
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce (so the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5).
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles (so the bay holding livestock must be bay 6 and the bay holding textiles must be bay 5).
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock (so the bay holding grain must be bay 1).
  Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is completely determined, which is a total of 5 bays.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  - Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  - If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding fuel must be bay 1.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding textiles must be bay 3.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so the bay holding livestock must be bay 2.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain must be bay 6.
  - The bay holding machinery must be bay 5.
  - Therefore, the type of cargo that each bay is holding is completely determined for all six bays.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are six bays numbered 1 through 6.
  - Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo.
  - The six types of cargo are: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Solution:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then:
  - Bay 1 cannot hold produce because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - Bay 2 cannot hold produce because the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  - Bay 3 cannot hold produce because the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - Bay 4 is holding produce.
  - Bay 5 cannot hold produce because the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  - Bay 6 must hold fuel because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.

  Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are determined as follows:
  - Bay 1: livestock
  - Bay 2: textiles
  - Bay 3: grain
  - Bay 4: produce
  - Bay 5: fuel
  - Bay 6: machinery

  The type of cargo for exactly 6 bays is completely determined.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles is either bay 3 or bay 5.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so the bay holding fuel is either bay 1 or bay 2.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so the bay holding livestock is either bay 4, 5, or 6.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain is either bay 5 or bay 6.
  Therefore, the possible arrangements of the bays and their cargos are:
    Bay 1: fuel or grain
    Bay 2: fuel or grain
    Bay 3: textiles
    Bay 4: produce
    Bay 5: livestock or grain
    Bay 6: livestock or grain

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 has at least 3 sales representatives.

Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 has at least 3 sales representatives. Therefore, Parra or Tiao (but not both) and at least one more sales representative work in Zone 1.
  - Since Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, and Mahr and Kim are not mentioned in any of the conditions, it is possible that both Mahr and Kim work in Zone 2.
  - Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and if Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must work in Zone 3 as well, which contradicts the condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - Tiao works in Zone 1 if and only if Parra works in Zone 3. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
  - Udall cannot work in Zone 3 because if Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well, which contradicts the condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two representatives in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, there are at least five representatives in Zone 1 and Zone 2 combined.
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, either Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 3, or Tiao works in Zone 1 and Udall works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Therefore, there are at most two representatives in each of the three sales zones.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 1. Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and there are more than 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, it follows that Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, it follows that Quinn also works in Zone 1. Since there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 1, and Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall have not been assigned to a sales zone yet, it follows that at least one of Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall works in Zone 1. Since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, and Tiao does not work in Zone 1, it follows that Udall works in Zone 2. Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, it follows that Stuckey also works in Zone 2. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and there are only two sales representatives left (Kim and Mahr), it follows that both Kim and Mahr work in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 has at least 3 sales representatives.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 3 has at most 2 sales representatives.
  - From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  - If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra works in Zone 3, which means that there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 1 and Udall works in Zone 2.
  - From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, and Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 2.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which means that Zone 3 has at least 3 sales representatives.
  
Action: Answer("C")

  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 must have at least 3 sales representatives, and Zone 3 must have at most 2 sales representatives. 
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. 
  We can also infer that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  This means that if Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn must also work in Zone 1, and if Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 2. 
  This leaves Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 3. 

Action: Answer("B") 
  Since Mahr is the only remaining sales representative, and we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it is possible that Mahr works in Zone 2. Therefore, the answer is B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then at most two sales representatives can work in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then at least four sales representatives work in Zone 1 or at most two sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  - If four sales representatives work in Zone 1, then Parra and Tiao must work in Zone 1, which contradicts the condition that Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, at most three sales representatives work in Zone 1.
  - If three sales representatives work in Zone 1, then Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and the other two sales representatives who work in Zone 1 must be Quinn and Kim or Quinn and Mahr. Therefore, Kim or Mahr cannot work in Zone 2, which eliminates choices A and B.
  - If two sales representatives work in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 1, and Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, choice E could be true.
  - If one sales representative works in Zone 3, then Parra works in Zone 1, and Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, choice C could be true.
  - If no sales representative works in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 1, and Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, choice E could be true.

  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two representatives in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, there must be at least three representatives in Zone 1.
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall works in Zone 2. This means that there are two representatives in Zone 2, which contradicts the fact that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Quinn also works in Zone 1.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Stuckey also works in Zone 2.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, there are three representatives in Zone 3.
  - Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 3.
  
Action: Answer("C")

- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives in Zone 2 must be 1.

Analysis:
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives in Zone 2 must be 1.
- Therefore, only one of Tiao or Udall can work in Zone 2.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1, so Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 1. This means that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
- If Udall works in Zone 2, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3. This leaves Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey to work in Zone 1 or Zone 3. If Kim and Mahr work in Zone 1, then there are more sales representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, either Kim or Mahr must work in Zone 3.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.

Knowledge:
  We need to determine which three students will give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  We know that exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  
  A: Helen, George, and Nina - We cannot have George on Monday because he can only give a report on Tuesday. We cannot have Nina on Monday because if she gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen - We cannot have Robert on Monday because he cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia - We cannot have Nina on Monday because if she gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - We cannot have Robert on Monday because he cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen - We cannot have Robert on Monday because he cannot give an afternoon report. We cannot have George on Monday because he can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  - Exactly 6 students will give individual oral reports during 3 consecutive days.
  - Exactly 2 reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Explanation: 
  - Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, they cannot be part of the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Tuesday morning report must be given by someone other than George.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so they must give a morning report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. So, if Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must give a report on Tuesday morning.
  - Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday could be given by:
    - Monday: Helen and Robert
    - Tuesday: Nina and Irving
    - Wednesday: Olivia and George
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. The reports will be given by exactly 6 students over 3 consecutive days.
  2. Exactly 2 reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  4. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  A: Helen, George, and Nina - If Helen and George give reports, then they must be on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. If Nina gives a report, then it must be on Monday. This leaves no one to give the afternoon reports on Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen - If Helen and Irving give reports, then they must be on Monday and Wednesday, respectively. If Robert gives a report, then it must be on Tuesday. This leaves no one to give the afternoon reports on Monday and Wednesday. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia - If Nina gives a report, then it must be on Monday. If Helen gives a report, then it must be on Tuesday. If Olivia gives a report, then it must be on Wednesday. This satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, this option is possible.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - If Olivia gives a report, then it must be on Monday. If Robert gives a report, then it must be on Tuesday. If Irving gives a report, then it must be on Wednesday. This satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, this option is possible.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen - If Robert and George give reports, then they must be on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. If Helen gives a report, then it must be on Wednesday. This leaves no one to give the afternoon reports on Monday and Wednesday. Therefore, this option is not possible.

  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left to give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  
Solution:
  1. Since Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, he must give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, they must give morning reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report, it must be on Wednesday.
  4. If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left to give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. Therefore, Kyle and Lenore cannot give morning reports.
  
We can now try each option:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
    - If George gives a report on Tuesday, he cannot give another report on Wednesday.
    - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Monday, which is not possible since Kyle and Lenore cannot give reports.
    - Therefore, this option is not possible.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
    - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he cannot give another report on Wednesday.
    - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Monday, which is not possible since Kyle and Lenore cannot give reports.

    - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he cannot give another report on Wednesday.
    - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Monday, which is not possible since Kyle and Lenore cannot give reports.
    - Therefore, this option is not possible.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
    - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he cannot give another report on Wednesday.
    - If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George must give a report on Tuesday.
    - Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
    - Therefore, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Monday.
    - Therefore, Olivia, Robert, and Irving must give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
    - This option is possible.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
    - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he cannot give another report on Wednesday.
    - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Monday, which is not possible since Kyle and Lenore cannot give reports.
    - Therefore, this option is not possible.

  4. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  5. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  6. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Solution:
  1. If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the students who will give reports are: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  2. George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports.
  4. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Wednesday, so they must give reports on Monday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on the other days.
  5. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
      - A: Helen, George, and Nina (not possible because George can only give a report on Tuesday)
      - B: Irving, Robert, and Helen (not possible because Robert cannot give a morning report)
      - C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia (not possible because Kyle and Lenore do not give reports)
      - D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving (possible)
      - E: Robert, George, and Helen (not possible because George can only give a report on Tuesday)

  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
Solution:
  Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the six students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. 
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Therefore, George must give a morning report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert must give morning reports on Monday and Wednesday, respectively.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, otherwise, Helen and Irving will both give reports on Wednesday. So, Nina must give a report on Monday or Wednesday. 
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  So, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Helen, George, and Nina.

Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  - Exactly 6 students will give individual oral reports during 3 consecutive days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly 2 reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Explanation: 
  - We know that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, so they cannot be part of the answer.
  - We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  - We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. So, if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Tuesday.
  - Therefore, the only possible answer is A: Helen, George, and Nina. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Solution:
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then we have six students left - George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  Also, neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports.
  
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. So, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. But, we have only one report left for Tuesday, which can only be given by George. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  
  So, Nina must give a report on Wednesday. This means that Helen and Irving must both give reports on Monday, and they cannot give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday must be given by Helen and Irving.
  
  Now, we have three students left - George, Olivia, and Robert - and we need to assign them to Tuesday and Wednesday. We know that George must give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Therefore, George and Olivia must give morning reports on Tuesday, and Robert must give a morning report on Wednesday.
  
  So, the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Helen and Irving, Helen and Irving, and Robert.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on a different shelf than I and M, because F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F must be on the top or middle shelf, and I and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf. However, we still don't know where K, L, G, or H are placed, so it is not fully determined which shelf each book is placed on.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we still don't know where F, I, L, M, H, or O are placed, so it is not fully determined which shelf each book is placed on.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must also be on that shelf, because F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, I must be on the other shelf on that level, and K and O must be on the remaining shelf on that level. On the other level, G and H must be on one shelf, and the remaining shelf must have the remaining book. Therefore, if L and F are placed on the same shelf, it is fully determined which shelf each book is placed on.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we still don't know where F, G, I, K, L, or O are placed, so it is not fully determined which shelf each book is placed on.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that L and F must also be on that shelf, because O is on a higher shelf than L, and F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, I and M must be on the remaining shelf on that level, and K and G must be on the remaining shelf on the other level. However, we still don't know where the books are placed on each shelf, so it is not fully determined which shelf each book is placed on.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  If I is on the middle shelf, then the top shelf must have at least 2 books and the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If F is on the same shelf as M, then F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If any two books are on the same shelf, then the third book must be on a different shelf.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, then the only possibility is that they are both on the middle shelf. 
  This means that I must be on the bottom shelf, and K and O must be on the top shelf. 
  Then, F and M must be on the bottom shelf together, and G and H must be on the top shelf together. 
  Therefore, the placement of all the books is fully determined.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If I is on the middle shelf, then the top shelf must have at least 2 books and the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  - If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf. This means that F and M must be on the same shelf on either the top or middle shelf.
  - If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf. This means that L and F must be on the same shelf on either the top or middle shelf.
  - If F and M are on the same shelf, then K cannot be on the top shelf because it is higher than F. Therefore, K must be on the middle shelf with I.
  - If H and O are on the same shelf, this does not provide enough information to determine the location of the other books.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The bookcase has exactly three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.

  F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  If I is placed on the middle shelf, then the top shelf must have at least two books and the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf and F cannot be on the top shelf.
  If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf and L cannot be on the top shelf.
  If F is placed on the same shelf as M, then F and M must be on the top, middle, or bottom shelf together.

Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then F must be on a different shelf than K, and O must be on a different shelf than L. Since there are only three shelves, this fully determines which shelf each book is on. Therefore, the answer is A.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The bookcase has exactly three shelves.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.

  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  If I is on the middle shelf, then the top shelf must have at least two books, and the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K must be on the top shelf, and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the top shelf, and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If F is on the same shelf as M, then F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If any two books are placed on the same shelf, then the placement of the other six books can be determined using the above conditions.

  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we do not know where F, G, H, K, L, and O are placed. This does not fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we do not know where F, H, I, L, M, and O are placed. This does not fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M is also on that shelf, since F is on the same shelf as M. We also know that K, I, and O are not on that shelf, since K is on a higher shelf than F, I is on the middle shelf, and O is on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, we can fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if L and F are placed on the same shelf.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we do not know where F, G, I, K, L, and O are placed. This does not fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

  - If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the placement of any other book, so this statement alone is not sufficient.
  - If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must also be on that shelf, and I must be on a different shelf. However, we cannot determine the exact placement of the remaining books, so this statement alone is not sufficient.
  - If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on the same shelf as M, and I must be on a different shelf. However, we cannot determine the exact placement of the remaining books, so this statement alone is not sufficient.
  - If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that L must be on a different shelf than O and H, and K must be on a different shelf than O and H. We also know that I, M, F, and G must be on the same shelf, which means that the remaining two books, L and K, must be on the remaining shelf. Therefore, we can determine the exact placement of all the books if H and O are placed on the same shelf.

  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If I is on the middle shelf, then there are 2 books on the middle shelf and at least 3 books on the bottom shelf. This leaves at most 3 books for the top shelf, which is not enough to accommodate K, O, and at least one more book.
  - If K and G are on the same shelf, then neither of them can be on the top shelf. If they are both on the middle shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf, which is not enough to accommodate I and at least one more book. Therefore, K and G must be on the bottom shelf. This leaves at most 2 books for the top shelf, which is not enough to accommodate O and at least one more book.
  - If L and F are on the same shelf, then they cannot be on the top shelf. If they are both on the middle shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf, which is not enough to accommodate I and at least one more book. Therefore, L and F must be on the bottom shelf. This leaves at most 2 books for the top shelf, which is not enough to accommodate K, O, and at least one more book.
  - If M and H are on the same shelf, then they cannot be on the top shelf. If they are both on the middle shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf, which is not enough to accommodate I and at least one more book. Therefore, M and H must be on the bottom shelf. This leaves at most 2 books for the top shelf, which is not enough to accommodate K, O, and at least one more book.
  - If H and O are on the same shelf, then they cannot be on the top shelf. If they are both on the middle shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf, which is not enough to accommodate I and at least one more book. Therefore, H and O must be on the bottom shelf. This leaves at most 2 books for the top shelf, which is not enough to accommodate K, L, F, and at least one more book.

  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we don't know the location of any other book. This is not enough information to fully determine the location of each book.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know the location of any other book. This is not enough information to fully determine the location of each book.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must be on the same shelf as well. This is because F is on the same shelf as M. We also know that K must be on a higher shelf than the shelf that L, F, and M are on. We know that I is on the middle shelf, so the remaining books (G and H) must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, we can determine the location of each book if L and F are placed on the same shelf.

  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  - Choice A: If Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, then at least two witnesses must testify on Tuesday, and Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. This satisfies all the conditions, so this schedule is possible. Therefore, choice A can be true of the schedule.
  - Choice B: Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, so Franco cannot testify on the same day as Iturbe. Therefore, choice B cannot be true of the schedule.
  - Choice C: Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so it is not possible for both Garcia and Hong to testify on Tuesday. Therefore, choice C cannot be true of the schedule.
  - Choice D: If Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, then Hong must testify on Tuesday, and Iturbe and Franco must testify on Wednesday. This satisfies all the conditions, so this schedule is possible. Therefore, choice D can be true of the schedule.
  - Choice E: If Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday, then Franco and Garcia must testify on Monday, and Hong and Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. This satisfies all the conditions, so this schedule is possible. Therefore, choice E can be true of the schedule.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing is to take exactly three days of one week: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  A: Franco could testify on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, but he cannot be the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday because at least one witness must testify on Monday.
  B: Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco cannot be scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.
  C: Hong does not testify on Monday, so Garcia and Hong cannot both be scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  D: Garcia is not scheduled to testify on the same day as Franco, so Garcia cannot be the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday. Also, Hong does not testify on Monday, so Hong cannot be one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  E: There are five witnesses and each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. If Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday, then the other witness scheduled to testify on Tuesday must be either Garcia or Hong. Therefore, only one witness can be scheduled to testify on Monday, and it cannot be two witnesses as stated in choice E.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing is three days long: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.

A: Franco can testify on Monday, but there must be at least one more witness who testifies on Monday. Thus, A can be true.
B: Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco cannot testify on the same day as Iturbe. Thus, B cannot be true.
C: Garcia and Hong cannot testify on the same day, so C cannot be true.
D: Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Hong cannot testify on Wednesday. If Garcia testifies on Monday, then Hong cannot testify on Monday either. Thus, D can be true.
E: If two witnesses testify on Monday, then only two witnesses remain to testify on Tuesday and Wednesday, so Jackson must testify on Wednesday. Thus, E can be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will each test one of four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) on the first day and then a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test G on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test J on the first day.
  
Analysis:
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test G on the first day. Therefore, Reynaldo, Seamus, or Yuki must test G on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the first day. Therefore, Reynaldo or Seamus must test H on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test J on the first day. Therefore, Reynaldo or Yuki must test J on the first day.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, if Yuki tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the second day.
  - If Reynaldo tests H on the first day, then he cannot test F on the second day. Therefore, Reynaldo must test J on the first day.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H.
  - Yuki's first-day bike must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bike per day, and all four bikes are tested each day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Seamus must test H on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Yuki must test J on the first day.
  
Analysis:
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Seamus must test H on the second day. 
  - If Seamus tests H on the second day, then Yuki must test J on the first day.
  - Therefore, Reynaldo must test F or G on the first day.
  - If Reynaldo tests G on the first day, then Theresa must test J on the first day.
  - If Reynaldo tests F on the first day, then Theresa must test G on the first day.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  - There are four bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider tests one bicycle on the first day and a different bicycle on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test G on the first day.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test G on the first day. This means that Reynaldo, Seamus, and Yuki must test F, H, and J on the first day, but we don't know which rider tests which bicycle. However, we do know that Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so Seamus must test J on the first day. This means that Yuki tests H on the first day. On the second day, Reynaldo must test F, Seamus must test H, and Theresa must test J. Therefore, Theresa tests J on the first day.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H.
  - Yuki tests a bike on day 1 that Seamus tests on day 2.
  - Each rider tests only one bike per day, and all four bikes are tested each day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then H must be tested by either Reynaldo or Seamus on the first day.
  
Analysis:
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then H must be tested by either Reynaldo or Seamus on the first day.
  - Theresa must test H on one of the two days.
  - Therefore, Reynaldo must test J on the first day, because he cannot test F, and H and G are already assigned to Theresa and Yuki.
  - Yuki cannot test J, so she must test F on the first day.
  - Seamus must test H on the second day, because Yuki tests F on the first day, and she tests a bike that Seamus tests on the second day.
  - Therefore, the only option that must be true is that Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day.
  - Therefore, Theresa must test H on the first day.
  - Yuki cannot test H on the first day because she cannot test J.
  - Therefore, Yuki tests F on the first day, and Seamus tests J on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test H on the first day because Theresa must test it.
  - Therefore, Reynaldo tests G on the first day.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. (It is possible, but not necessary.)
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. (It is possible, but not necessary.)
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day. (It is not possible because Theresa tests G on the second day.)
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. (It is not possible because Reynaldo cannot test F, and Yuki cannot test J.)
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day. (It is not possible because Theresa must be one of the testers for H, and Theresa tests G on the second day.)

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. It is possible, but not necessary.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. It is possible, but not necessary.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day. This is not possible because Theresa tests G on the second day and she cannot test H on the same day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. This is not possible because Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day. This is not possible because Yuki cannot test J on the first day, and the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
Process of elimination:
  - Reynaldo cannot test F, so options A and B are not possible.
  - Theresa must test H on one of the two days, so option C is not possible.
  - Yuki cannot test J, so option E is not possible.
  
Final answer:
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Yuki must test J on the first day, and Seamus must test G on the second day. Therefore, Reynaldo must test F on the first day, leaving Theresa to test H on the first day. Thus, Theresa tests J on the first day.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day.
  - Therefore, Theresa must test H on the first day.
  - Yuki cannot test H on the first day because Yuki cannot test J.
  - Seamus must test H on the second day because the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test J on the first day because Yuki cannot test J.
  - Therefore, Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days.
  - Each rider will test only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then H must be tested by either Reynaldo or Seamus on the first day.
  
Analysis:
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then H must be tested by either Reynaldo or Seamus on the first day.
  - However, Reynaldo cannot test F, and Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - Therefore, Reynaldo must test J on the first day (since he cannot test F), and Seamus must test H on the first day (since Theresa must be one of the testers for H, and Yuki cannot test J).
  - This means that Yuki must test F on the first day (since all four bicycles must be tested each day), and Seamus must test Yuki's bicycle (F) on the second day (since the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day).
  - Therefore, the only option that must be true is D: Theresa tests J on the first day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven articles to be edited, and they are categorized into three groups: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  A: If H is fourth, we do not know the order of the other articles. There are multiple possible orders.
  B: If H is sixth, we know that the first three articles must be Q, R, and S in some order. Then, the fourth article must be either G or J, and the fifth article must be the other one. Finally, Y must be the last article. Therefore, the order is fully determined.
  C: If R is fourth, we know that the first three articles must be Q, S, and either G or J. Then, the fourth article must be the other one. However, we do not know the order of the remaining three articles. There are multiple possible orders.
  D: If R is seventh, we know that Y must be fifth and either G or J must be fourth. Then, the first three articles must be Q, S, and the other one between G and J. However, we do not know the order of H and the remaining article. There are multiple possible orders.
  E: If Y is fifth, we know that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, the first three articles must be Q, S, and either G or J. Then, the fourth article must be the other one between G and J. Finally, H and R must be the sixth and seventh articles, but we do not know which one comes first. There are two possible orders.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - The articles can be grouped into 3 categories: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
  - If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, in that order. However, we don't know where Y, G, H, and J would fit in, so this information is not enough to fully determine the order.
  - If H is sixth, then the first five articles must be Q, R, S, Y, and G, in that order. Then, J and H must be the last two articles, but we don't know which one comes first. Therefore, this information is not enough to fully determine the order.
  - If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y, in that order. Then, G, J, H must be the next three articles, in that order, and R must be the last article. Therefore, this information is enough to fully determine the order.
  - If R is seventh, then Y must be the first article, followed by S, Q, G, J, H, and R. Therefore, this information is enough to fully determine the order.
  - If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, G, and J, in some order. However, we don't know where Y, H, and R would fit in, so this information is not enough to fully determine the order.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, in that order. The fourth article cannot be H because it covers the same topic as S. The fifth article must be Y, and the sixth and seventh articles must be J and G, in that order. This satisfies all the conditions, so the order is fully determined.
  
  If H is sixth, then the first five articles must be Q, R, S, Y, and J, in that order. The sixth article cannot be H because it covers the same topic as J. The seventh article must be G, and this violates the condition that J must be earlier than G. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
  
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be S, Y, and Q, in that order. The fourth article must be G, and this violates the condition that J must be earlier than G. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
  
  If R is seventh, then the first six articles must be S, Y, Q, H, J, and G, in that order. This satisfies all the conditions, so the order is fully determined.
  
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be S, Q, R, and H, in that order. The fifth article must be Y, and this violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven articles: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the order of the first four articles is either QRSY or RQSY. This leaves three articles that must be ordered: GHJ. Since J must be earlier than G and G must be earlier than R, the only possible order for these three articles is GHJ. Therefore, the order of the seven articles is fully determined if H is fourth. 
  If H is sixth, then the order of the first five articles is either QRSGY or RQSGY. This leaves two articles that must be ordered: HJ. Since J must be earlier than G and G must be earlier than R, there is no way to order HJ without violating the given conditions. Therefore, the order of the seven articles is not fully determined if H is sixth.
  If R is fourth, then the order of the first four articles is either GHJY or JHGY. This leaves three articles that must be ordered: QRS. Since S must be earlier than Q, there is only one possible order for these three articles: SQR. Therefore, the order of the seven articles is fully determined if R is fourth.
  If R is seventh, then the order of the first six articles is either GHJQSY or JHGQSY. This leaves one article that must be ordered: Y. Since S must be earlier than Y, there is only one possible order for the seven articles: JHGQSY. Therefore, the order of the seven articles is fully determined if R is seventh.
  If Y is fifth, then the order of the first four articles is either GHJQ or JHGQ. This leaves three articles that must be ordered: RSY. Since S must be earlier than Y, there is only one possible order for these three articles: SRY. Therefore, the order of the seven articles is fully determined if Y is fifth.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  G, H, and J cover finance.
  Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  Y covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  A: If H is fourth, we don't know which articles come before or after it. This doesn't help us determine the order of the articles.
  B: If H is sixth, then the order of the articles is determined as follows: 
      1. Q
      2. S
      3. R
      4. G
      5. J
      6. H
      7. Y
      Therefore, the answer is B.
  C: If R is fourth, we don't know which articles come before or after it. This doesn't help us determine the order of the articles.
  D: If R is seventh, we don't know which articles come before or after it. This doesn't help us determine the order of the articles.

  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: If H is fourth, we don't know anything about the order of the other articles. This choice does not fully determine the order of the articles.
B: If H is sixth, then the order of the articles must be: Q, R, S, G, J, H, Y. This choice fully determines the order of the articles.
C: If R is fourth, then the order of the articles must be: S, Q, G, R, J, H, Y. This choice fully determines the order of the articles.
D: If R is seventh, we don't know anything about the order of the other articles. This choice does not fully determine the order of the articles.
E: If Y is fifth, we don't know anything about the order of the other articles. This choice does not fully determine the order of the articles.

Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The articles are divided into three groups: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S in some order. However, since S must be earlier than Y, and Y cannot be fourth, it is impossible to determine the order of the remaining articles. Therefore, A is not the answer.

B: If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S in some order. Since S must be earlier than Y, Y must be seventh. Therefore, the order of the remaining articles must be G, J, and R in some order. This satisfies all the conditions, so B is the answer.

C: If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and either G or J. However, since S must be earlier than Y, and Y cannot be fourth, it is impossible to determine the order of the remaining articles. Therefore, C is not the answer.

D: If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y in that order. However, since S must be earlier than Q, it is impossible to determine the order of the remaining articles. Therefore, D is not the answer.

E: If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, G, and J in some order. However, since S must be earlier than Y, and Y cannot be fifth, it is impossible to determine the order of the remaining articles. Therefore, E is not the answer.

  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the order of the articles could be Q, R, G, J, H, S, Y or S, Q, R, G, J, H, Y. Therefore, the order is not fully determined if H is fourth.
  If H is sixth, then the order of the articles could be Q, R, G, J, S, H, Y. Therefore, the order is not fully determined if H is sixth.
  If R is fourth, then the order of the articles could be S, Q, G, J, R, H, Y. Therefore, the order is not fully determined if R is fourth.
  If R is seventh, then the order of the articles could be S, Q, G, J, H, Y, R. Therefore, the order is fully determined if R is seventh.
  If Y is fifth, then the order of the articles could be S, Q, G, J, Y, H, R. Therefore, the order is not fully determined if Y is fifth.

  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  
A: If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles. However, it is not clear which nutrition article should be edited first, so the order is not fully determined.
B: If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles, and the fourth and fifth articles must be finance articles. However, it is not clear which finance article should be edited first, so the order is not fully determined.
C: If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be finance articles, and the fourth article must be R. Then, the fifth article must be S, and the sixth article must be Y. The last article can be either G or H, but it cannot be the one that covers finance that was edited before. Therefore, the order is fully determined.
D: If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be finance articles, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth articles must be nutrition articles. Then, the last article must be Y. However, it is not clear which finance article should be edited first, so the order is not fully determined.
E: If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be nutrition articles, and the fifth article must be S. Then, the sixth article must be Y, and the last article can be either G or H, but it cannot be the one that covers finance that was edited before. Therefore, the order is fully determined.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf. Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there are at least 4 books on the bottom shelf. Therefore, there are exactly 2 books on the middle shelf. We know that I is one of the books on the middle shelf. Also, since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the middle shelf if F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F, M, and K are on the same shelf, which is either the top or the bottom shelf. If F, M, and K are on the top shelf, then there are only 2 books on the bottom shelf, which is a contradiction. Therefore, F, M, and K are on the bottom shelf, and there are 4 books on the bottom shelf. Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the middle shelf, and L must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is {I, O}.

  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be 4 books on the bottom shelf and 2 or 3 books on the middle shelf.
  - The remaining books (besides G, which is on the top shelf) must be on the bottom shelf.
  
Solution:
  - If G is on the top shelf, then the remaining books (besides F and M) must be on the bottom shelf.
  - There are 4 books left to place on the bottom shelf: H, I, K, O.
  - I is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - K and O must be on the top or middle shelf, so they cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Therefore, H must be on the bottom shelf.
  - The complete and accurate list of books on the middle shelf is: I, L.

  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
If G is placed on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books, and the middle shelf must have at least 2 books. We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so the middle shelf must have at least one more book. We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf. Finally, we know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F cannot be on the middle shelf either. Therefore, the only book that can be on the middle shelf is H, and the only complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is H, I.

  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf. Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf. Therefore, there are exactly 3 books on the middle shelf. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, it is one of the books on the middle shelf. Also, since F is placed on the same shelf as M, and G is placed on the top shelf, neither F nor M can be on the middle shelf. This means that the middle shelf contains exactly 3 books: G, I, and one other book that is not F or M.

  - I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F and M must be on the same shelf.
  - Therefore, M cannot be on the top shelf, since G is already on the top shelf.
  - This means that F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - Since I is on the middle shelf, and K and O cannot be on the bottom shelf, L must be on the middle shelf with I.
  - This leaves H and K to be placed on the bottom shelf with at least one more book.

  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then we know that:
  - There are at least two books on the top shelf (G and at least one more).
  - There are at least two books on the middle shelf (I and at least one more).
  - There are at least three books on the bottom shelf (more than the top shelf).
  - K and O cannot be on the top shelf because they are both on higher shelves than F, which is not on the top shelf.
  - L cannot be on the top shelf because O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - Therefore, H, I, K, L, M, and O are all on the bottom two shelves.
  
  Possible combinations of books on the middle shelf are:
  - H, I, L
  - I, K, L
  - F, I, M

  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf and at least 2 books on the middle shelf. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, we know that I is on the middle shelf with another book. We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K and F cannot be on the same shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf. Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf. This means that H must be on the middle shelf as well to satisfy the condition that at least 2 books are on each shelf.

  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books (because more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf). Since I is placed on the middle shelf, it cannot be placed on the top or bottom shelf. Therefore, I must be placed on the middle shelf with G. Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, and K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K and L must be on the bottom shelf with at least one other book. That leaves H and O to be placed on the top shelf and the middle shelf, but we don't know which book goes where.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.

  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 6th.
  - The vase is auctioned before the mirror, so the vase cannot be auctioned on June 6th.
  - The mirror cannot be auctioned on June 6th either, so it must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase or the harmonica, so it cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st.

Action: Answer("D")

If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then it is possible that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. This satisfies the condition that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.

  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the sundial must be auctioned before the table.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table, then the table cannot be auctioned before the vase. Therefore, the vase must be auctioned before the table.
  - If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned before the table. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned after the table.
  - If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the vase cannot be auctioned before the table. Therefore, the mirror must be auctioned after the vase.
  
Action: Answer("D")

  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  
Analysis:
  - We know that the table is auctioned on a date later than both the mirror and the vase.
  - If the table is auctioned after the vase, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the table since the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the table, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the table since if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - Therefore, the only possible option is D, which states that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Action: Answer("D")

Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the table.
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the lamp could be auctioned before or after the table.
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the sundial must be auctioned before the table.
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then we cannot determine the order between the mirror and the vase.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned before the mirror.
  
Action: Answer("A")

  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.

To answer this question, we need to use the given information to determine the possible order of the auctions.

Possible order of the auctions:
June 1: Vase
June 2: Harmonica
June 3: Table
June 4: Lamp
June 5: Mirror
June 6: Sundial

If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the following could be true:
A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table. (False, since the table is auctioned on June 3 and the harmonica is auctioned on June 2)
B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. (False, since the table is auctioned on June 3 and the lamp is auctioned on June 4)
C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial. (False, since the table is auctioned on June 3 and the sundial is auctioned on June 6)
D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. (True, since the vase is auctioned on June 1 and the mirror is auctioned on June 5)
E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. (False, since the sundial is auctioned on June 6 and the lamp is auctioned on June 4)

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("D") 

Explanation: 
If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the only option that could be true is that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. This is because the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.

Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

  A: It is possible to have a multicolored rug with forest, but it cannot be used with turquoise. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  B: Turquoise cannot be used with forest or peach. Therefore, if a rug is multicolored, it cannot contain turquoise. This statement must be true.
  C: Peach is used in a rug because it is used with olive. Therefore, this statement must be true.
  D: Turquoise cannot be used with forest or peach. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  E: Yellow can be used in a rug because it is not restricted from being used with any other color. However, it is not a necessary condition. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("B")

  Choice B is true. Turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug because it cannot be used with forest, peach, or yellow.
  Choice C is true. Peach is used in a rug because it is used with olive.
  Choice D is not necessarily true. Turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug, but it can be used in a solid rug.
  Choice E is not necessarily true. Yellow can be used in a solid rug.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread.
  - Six colors of thread are available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  - Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Solution:
  - If forest is used in a multicolored rug, it must be used with two other colors, which means that turquoise cannot be used in the same rug. Therefore, A is not true.
  - If turquoise is used in a multicolored rug, it cannot be used with forest or peach, which means that it must be used with olive, white, or yellow. Therefore, B is not true.
  - Since peach cannot be used with turquoise in a rug, and there are only five colors available, peach must be used in one of the rugs. Therefore, C must be true.
  - Turquoise cannot be used with forest or peach, but it can be used with olive, white, or yellow. Therefore, D is not necessarily true.
  - Yellow can be used in a rug with any of the other colors except peach. Therefore, E is not necessarily true.

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread.
  - Six colors of thread are available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  - Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Solution:
  - If forest is used in a multicolored rug, then the other color(s) must be chosen from olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow. However, neither olive nor peach can be used with forest, and turquoise cannot be used with forest, so the only possibility is to use white and yellow with forest. But this violates the rule that in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. Therefore, there are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used. So, option A is true.
  - Turquoise cannot be used with forest, peach, or yellow. So, if turquoise is used, it must be used with olive, white, and one of the other two colors. But this violates the rule that peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Therefore, there are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used. So, option B is true.
  - Peach is used in a rug in which olive is used. So, option C is true.
  - Turquoise cannot be used with forest, peach, or yellow. So, if turquoise is used, it must be used with olive, white, and one of the other two colors. Therefore, turquoise may or may not be used in one of the rugs. So, option D may or may not be true.
  - Yellow can be used with olive, peach, white, and one of the other two colors. Therefore, yellow may or may not be used in one of the rugs. So, option E may or may not be true.

Action: Answer("B")

  - Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread.
  - Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Solution:
  - Since there are three rugs and six colors, and each color is used in only one rug, exactly two colors will not be used.
  - If we assume that forest is used in all three rugs, then we will have to use all other colors, which will violate the condition that forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Therefore, there are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used. So, option A is true.
  - If we assume that turquoise is used in all three rugs, then we will have to use all other colors, which will violate the condition that forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug and the condition that peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Therefore, there are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used. So, option B is true.
  - Since peach is used in the rug in which olive is used, and olive is used in one of the rugs, peach is used in one of the rugs. So, option C is true.
  - We cannot assume that turquoise or forest is used in all three rugs, as it will violate the given conditions. Therefore, we cannot say for sure that turquoise is used in one of the rugs. So, option D is not necessarily true.
  - We cannot assume that yellow is not used in any of the rugs, as it will violate the condition that peach and yellow are not used together in a rug. Therefore, yellow is used in one of the rugs. So, option E is true.

  - Peach is used in a rug because it is used in the same rug as olive, according to the rule. So, option C is true.
  - Turquoise cannot be used in the same rug as peach, according to the rule. So, option D is false.
  - Yellow can be used in a rug because it is not restricted by any of the rules. So, option E is true.

Action: Answer("E")

Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  There are four years to be assigned, and each year will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project. Therefore, one of the students will not be assigned to any year. We need to determine which of the given options could be true under this condition.

Solution:
  Option A: Louis is not assigned to the project. - This option cannot be true because Louis is one of the students available for the project, and each year will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  Option B: Ryan is not assigned to the project. - This option could be true. If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx will not be assigned to any year, and the remaining four students can be assigned to the four years.
  Option C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project. - This option cannot be true because if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan will not be assigned to the project, which violates the condition "If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project."
  Option D: Onyx is assigned to 1922. - This option could be true. If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan will be assigned to 1923 (because of the condition "If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's"), and the remaining two students can be assigned to the remaining two years.
  Option E: Louis is assigned to 1924. - This option cannot be true because if Louis is assigned to 1924, then only Tiffany can be assigned to 1923 (because of the condition "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923"), and the remaining two students can be assigned to the remaining two years. However, this violates the condition "each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it" because two students will be assigned to the same year (1923).
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project has four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  There are six students available: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  
  A: We do not have enough information to determine if Louis is assigned to the project or not.
  B: We do not have enough information to determine if Ryan is assigned to the project or not.
  C: We do not have enough information to determine if Tiffany is assigned to the project or not.
  D: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, and Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to any year, because there would be no year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, D is not a possible option.
  E: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, and Louis is assigned to 1924, then Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan must be assigned to 1922 or 1923, and Onyx must be assigned to 1921 or 1922. This is a possible scenario.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The project has four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Each year has exactly one student assigned to it.
  Six students are available: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there are only five students available for the project.
  
  A: We don't know if Louis is assigned to the project or not.
  B: We don't know if Ryan is assigned to the project or not.
  C: We don't know if Tiffany is assigned to the project or not.
  D: Onyx can be assigned to 1922 if Ryan is not assigned to the project. This satisfies the condition that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  E: Louis cannot be assigned to 1924 if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923, which means that Louis cannot be assigned to 1924.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  There are four years and four students, so each student will be assigned to exactly one year.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the four students who will be assigned to the project are Louis, Mollie, Onyx, and Ryan. 
  From the given conditions, we know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to a year other than 1923. If Ryan is assigned to a year other than 1923, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This means that Onyx cannot be assigned to 1921, since there is no year prior to 1921. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1922 or 1924. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. This means that Louis must be assigned to 1923 or 1924. 

Action: Answer("E") 
Therefore, it could be true that Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The project requires four students to be assigned to the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned, Ryan must be assigned.
  If Ryan is assigned, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Yoshio is not assigned, there will be five students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned, there will be five students available for the project. Since there are only four years to be assigned, one of the students will not be assigned to any year. We need to determine which of the choices could be true based on the given conditions.

A: Louis is not assigned to the project. 
  This is possible, but we do not have enough information to confirm it.

B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  This is possible, but we do not have enough information to confirm it.

C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  This is possible, but we do not have enough information to confirm it.

D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  This is possible. If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, Tiffany must be assigned to 1924, and either Louis or Mollie must be assigned to 1921.

E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
  This is not possible. If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, Ryan must be assigned to 1922, and Onyx must be assigned to 1921. This would leave no one to be assigned to 1924.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a possible scenario where Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Elimination:
  A: We cannot have Louis not assigned to the project because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and we need to assign someone to that year.
  B: We cannot have Ryan not assigned to the project because if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  C: We cannot have Tiffany not assigned to the project because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  D: This could be possible. If we assign Onyx to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, Tiffany must be assigned to 1924, and Louis must be assigned to 1921.
  E: We cannot have Louis assigned to 1924 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and if Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - There are six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Action: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, it means that there are only five students available for the project. 
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there are only four students available for the project. However, there are four years to cover, so this cannot be true.
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project either, because if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. However, this would mean that Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project, which contradicts the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. Then, either Louis or Mollie must be assigned to 1921. This is possible, so the answer is D.
  
Answer: D
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The project consists of four years, and each year has exactly one student assigned to it.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available for the project.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available for the project. There are six students available for the project, so one of them will not be assigned to any year. We need to find an option that is possible given the conditions of the problem.
  
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project. This option is possible, but it does not provide any information about the assignment of the other students.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project. This option is not possible because if Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which violates one of the conditions of the problem.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project. This option is possible, but it does not provide any information about the assignment of the other students.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922. This option is possible because Onyx can be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, and Ryan can be assigned to 1924. Then, Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and Mollie can be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924. This option is not possible because if Louis is assigned to 1924, then only Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, which violates one of the conditions of the problem.

  D: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are five students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, if Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. Louis and Mollie would be assigned to 1921 and 1922 (in some order). This scenario satisfies all of the conditions and is possible, so D could be true.
  E: We know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Tiffany's. However, this would mean that Onyx must be assigned to 1922, which is not possible because Louis and Mollie would be assigned to 1921 and 1922 (in some order) and Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922 if she is assigned to the project. Therefore, E cannot be true.

  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. This means that P cannot be published in the fall, so the only possible pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - M is published in the fall.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  - Since M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. But we know nothing about K yet.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. So, P must be published in the spring.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other. So, K must be published in the fall along with M.
  - Therefore, O must also be published in the fall along with K.

Action: Answer("A")  
The pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M are K and O.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. P cannot be published in the same season as M, so it must be published in the spring. That leaves L and either K or O to be published in the fall along with M.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. M is published in the fall.
  2. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  3. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  4. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  5. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 5, if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall. K and N must be published in the same season, so K cannot be published in the fall either. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall, but O is not an option for a cookbook that could be published in the fall along with M. Therefore, K and O cannot be published in the fall. P cannot be published in the fall because M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. This leaves L and 0 as the only two cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. M is published in the fall, so N must be published in the spring.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  
Using the given conditions, we can derive the following possibilities:
- If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall.
- P cannot be published in the fall with M, so the only option left is L and 0.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. M is published in the fall.
  2. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  3. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  4. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  5. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. P cannot be published in the fall. That means the only possible pair of cookbooks that could be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, if K is not published in the fall, O cannot be published in the fall.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, P cannot be published in the fall if M is published in the fall.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, if K is not published in the fall, N cannot be published in the fall.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Cookbooks L and O could both be published in the fall along with M.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring (according to rule 4). Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M. 
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall (according to rule 3). Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall together. 
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other (according to rule 1). Therefore, P cannot be published in the fall with M. 
  This leaves us with L and 0 as possible pairs that can be published in the fall with M.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall. 
  If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, if K is published in the fall, then O cannot be published in the spring. 
  Since K and N must be published in the same season as each other, and N cannot be published in the fall, then K must be published in the spring. 
  Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is O and L.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. This means that L and P cannot be published in the fall because they would have to be published with M. Therefore, the only possible pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions that are performed before S are O and either F or R. Since O is performed either first or fifth, the possible orders of the first three compositions are:
  - O, F, S
  - O, R, S
  
  A: F, H, P - None of these compositions can be performed before S in this order.
  B: H, P. L - None of these compositions can be performed before S in this order.
  C: O, P, R - This order is possible since O is performed first, P is performed before S, and R is performed after O and before F.
  D: O, P, T - This order is not possible since T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  E: P, R, T - This order is not possible since T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - T can be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the compositions performed before S is either O, P, and T or T, P, and O. Since T can be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, we can deduce the following:
  - If T is performed immediately before F, then the order of the compositions performed before S is T, P, O. In this case, the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, could be O, P, and T (Option D).
  - If T is performed immediately after R, then the order of the compositions performed before S is O, P, T. In this case, the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, could be O, P, and T (Option D).
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be one of the following:
  - O _ _ : In this case, the only composition that can be performed fifth is F, and the only composition that can be performed eighth is H. Therefore, the order of the first three compositions could be O, P, R. (Choice C)
  - F _ _ or _ _ R: In this case, the only composition that can be performed fifth is H, and the only composition that can be performed eighth is L. Therefore, neither of these cases could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed before S must be O and either F or R. Therefore, the composition performed third must be one of the compositions that can be performed immediately before F or immediately after R, which are T and S. So, the possible lists of the compositions performed first, second, and third are:
  - O, F, T
  - O, F, S
  - O, R, T
  - O, R, S
  
  A: F, H, P - P is performed before S, so this is not possible.
  B: H, P, L - P is performed before S, so this is not possible.
  C: O, P, R - This is possible, but S is not performed yet.
  D: O, P, T - This is possible and consistent with the conditions given.
  E: P, R, T - P is performed before S, so this is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The order of the compositions must satisfy several conditions, including:
    - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
    - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
    - O is performed either first or fifth.
    - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
    - P is performed at some time before S.
    - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  - We are given that S is performed fourth.
  - We need to find a list of the compositions performed first, second, and third that is consistent with the given conditions.
  
Elimination:
  - Choice A: F, H, P
    - If S is performed fourth, then P must be performed before S. Therefore, P cannot be performed third. Eliminate A.
  - Choice B: H, P, L
    - If S is performed fourth, then P must be performed before S. Therefore, P cannot be performed second. Eliminate B.
  - Choice C: O, P, R
    - If S is performed fourth, then at least one composition must be performed after S and before O. Therefore, O cannot be performed first. Eliminate C.
  - Choice D: O, P, T
    - If S is performed fourth, then at least one composition must be performed after S and before O. Therefore, O cannot be performed first. Eliminate D.
  - Choice E: P, R, T
    - If S is performed fourth, then at least one composition must be performed after S and before O. Therefore, O cannot be performed first. 
    - If T is performed immediately after R, then R cannot be performed third. Therefore, R must be performed second and P must be performed first. 
    - This gives us the list: P, R, T, which is consistent with the given conditions.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the compositions performed before S is either O-P-R or R-P-O.
  
  A: F, H, P - If P is performed after S, then P cannot be performed before S. This option is not possible.
  B: H, P. L - If S is performed fourth, then H and L cannot be the eighth composition performed. This option is not possible.
  C: O, P, R - This option is possible. O is performed first, P is performed second, and R is performed third.
  D: O, P, T - If T is performed immediately after R, then T cannot be performed third. This option is not possible.
  E: P, R, T - If S is performed fourth, then P cannot be performed before S. This option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then we know that P must be performed before S. This means that O cannot be performed first, because if it were, then there would be no way to perform P before S. Therefore, O must be performed fifth. This also means that L or H must be performed eighth. Since we do not know which one it is, we cannot determine the order of the last three compositions. However, we can determine the order of the first five compositions based on the given conditions.
  
  A: F, H, P - This is not possible because O must be performed fifth.
  B: H, P, L - This is not possible because we do not know if L or H is performed eighth.
  C: O, P, R - This is possible because O is performed fifth, P is performed before S, and R can be performed after F and before S.
  D: O, P, T - This is not possible because T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  E: P, R, T - This is not possible because we do not know if T is performed before or after F.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the compositions must satisfy the following conditions:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then P must be performed before the fourth composition, which means P must be either first, second, or third.
  
  A: If P is performed second, then the first composition must be either O or L/H, which violates the condition that O must be performed either first or fifth. Therefore, A is not possible.
  B: If P is performed first, then the second composition must be either O or L/H, which violates the condition that O must be performed either first or fifth. Therefore, B is not possible.
  C: If O is performed first, then P must be performed second, and R must be performed third. This satisfies the condition that O must be performed either first or fifth, and the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Therefore, C is possible.
  D: If O is performed first, then P must be performed second, and T must be performed third. This satisfies the condition that O must be performed either first or fifth, but violates the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. Therefore, D is not possible.
  E: If P is performed first, then R must be performed second, and T must be performed third. This violates the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H. Therefore, E is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The compositions to be performed are F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the possible compositions that could be performed before S are O, P, R, F, and H/L.
  
  A: F, H, P - If P is performed after F, then S cannot be performed fourth. Incorrect.
  B: H, P, L - If P is performed before S, then S cannot be performed fourth. Incorrect.
  C: O, P, R - This is a possible order. Keep this as a possible answer.
  D: O, P, T - If T is performed immediately after R, then S cannot be performed fourth. Incorrect.
  E: P, R, T - If T is performed immediately after R, then S cannot be performed fourth. Incorrect.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds the cargo with the highest number.
  Bay 6 holds the cargo with the lowest number.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
  If bay 4 holds grain, then bay 5 must hold livestock, and bay 6 must hold textiles. This would mean that bay 3 holds produce, which would mean that bay 2 holds fuel and bay 1 holds machinery. However, this would violate the rule that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, grain cannot be held in bay 4.
  
  If bay 4 holds livestock, then bay 5 must hold textiles, and bay 3 must hold grain. This would mean that bay 2 holds produce, which would mean that bay 1 holds fuel and bay 6 holds machinery. This arrangement satisfies all the given rules.
  
  If bay 4 holds machinery, then bay 5 must hold produce, and bay 3 must hold fuel. This would mean that bay 2 holds textiles, which would mean that bay 1 holds grain and bay 6 holds livestock. This arrangement satisfies all the given rules.
  
  If bay 4 holds produce, then bay 5 must hold fuel, and bay 3 must hold textiles. This would mean that bay 2 holds grain, which would mean that bay 1 holds livestock and bay 6 holds machinery. This arrangement satisfies all the given rules.
  
  If bay 4 holds textiles, then bay 5 must hold produce, and bay 3 must hold livestock. This would mean that bay 2 holds fuel, which would mean that bay 1 holds grain and bay 6 holds machinery. This arrangement satisfies all the given rules.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  Bay 4 is holding one of the remaining three types of cargo. 
  If bay 4 holds grain, then bay 5 must hold livestock, and bay 6 must hold textiles. But this violates the rule that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  If bay 4 holds livestock, then bay 5 must hold textiles, and bay 6 must hold grain. But this violates the rule that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  If bay 4 holds produce, then bay 5 must hold fuel, and bay 6 must hold machinery. But this violates the rule that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  If bay 4 holds textiles, then bay 3 must hold produce, and bay 5 must hold livestock. This satisfies all the given rules and is a possible arrangement.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining one type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Bay 6 holds the remaining one type of cargo, which is not livestock.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo, which is not livestock.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo, which could be grain, machinery, or textiles.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo, which could be grain, livestock, machinery, or textiles.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo, which could be grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo, which could be grain, livestock, machinery, produce, textiles, or fuel.
  Therefore, livestock cannot be held in bay 4 because the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  Bay 4 is not adjacent to the bay holding textiles, which means it is adjacent to the bay holding produce. Therefore, the type of cargo held in bay 4 cannot be produce. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds the cargo with the highest number.
  Bay 6 holds the cargo with the lowest number.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  Bay 4 is not the first or the last bay, so it can hold any of the six types of cargo. 
  However, since the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, and bay 5 is the only bay next to bay 4, the cargo in bay 5 must be either textiles or produce. 
  Therefore, the cargo in bay 4 cannot be textiles or produce.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the five remaining types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the four remaining types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the three remaining types of cargo.

  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  Bay 4 is holding one of the three remaining types of cargo. 
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so produce cannot be held in bay 4.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles cannot be held in bay 4.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so livestock cannot be held in bay 4.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so grain cannot be held in bay 4.
  That leaves machinery as the only remaining option.

Analysis:
  Bay 1, 2, and 3 cannot hold the cargo in question because they have a lower number than bay 4.
  Bay 5 and 6 cannot hold the cargo in question because they have a higher number than bay 4.
  The cargo in bay 4 cannot be livestock because the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The cargo in bay 4 cannot be produce because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, and the bay holding fuel cannot be bay 5 or 6.
  The cargo in bay 4 cannot be textiles because the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The cargo in bay 4 cannot be grain because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 1, 2, or 3.
  
Action: Answer("C")

  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Bay 4 is between Bay 3 and Bay 5.
  
Analysis:
  Bay 4 is between Bay 3 and Bay 5, and it is not adjacent to the bay holding textiles. Therefore, the cargo in Bay 4 cannot be textiles. 
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so the cargo in Bay 4 cannot be fuel. 
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so the cargo in Bay 4 cannot be livestock or textiles. 
  The only remaining options are grain and machinery.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  - Each student has two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then:
- Franz's oil must be displayed on a different wall than Greene's watercolor.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than Franz's watercolor and Greene's oil.
- No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, so each wall must have at least one oil painting.
- No wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, so each wall must have paintings from at least two students.
- No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so neither of their watercolors can be on the same wall as Greene's oil.
Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's watercolor, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than Isaacs's watercolor. This means that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, so the answer is C.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then:
- Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on wall 4.
- Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be on wall 4, and Hidalgo's oil must be on a different wall.
- Since no wall can have only watercolors, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position.
Therefore, Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, which means that choice C is true.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then:
  - Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor are on the same wall.
  - Greene's oil cannot be on the same wall as Franz's oil or watercolor.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's oil cannot be on the same wall as Franz's watercolor.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so there must be an oil painting on the same wall as Hidalgo's watercolor.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on the same wall as Franz's oil.
  
Analysis: 
  - Hidalgo's watercolor must be on a wall with an oil painting, but it is not specified which one.
  - Hidalgo's oil can be on any of the walls except wall 4, where Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position.
  - Isaacs's watercolor can be on any of the walls except the one where Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Greene's oil can be on any of the walls except the one where Franz's watercolor is displayed.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students displaying two paintings each at an exhibition.
  - Two paintings are displayed on each of the four walls of the exhibition room.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then the two paintings displayed on that wall must be Greene's oil and Franz's watercolor. Therefore, Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of that wall. This means that Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed in the upper position of any other wall. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, then the other painting on the same wall as Greene's oil and Franz's watercolor must be an oil painting. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of that wall. This means that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor (because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it). Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on one of the two walls that do not have Isaacs's watercolor. Since Hidalgo's oil is already accounted for, then Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed in an upper position. Therefore, the only option that must be true is that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in a lower position. Thus, the answer is C.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students displaying two paintings each.
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. Since no wall can have only watercolors, Greene's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which means that Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of wall 1 or 2, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. So, Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Analysis: 
  - If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Franz's oil must be displayed on a different wall.
  - Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall from the one where Greene's oil is displayed.
  - Since no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on a different wall from the one where Franz's watercolor is displayed.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  - Since Hidalgo has one oil and one watercolor, and Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  - Therefore, the correct answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will display two paintings each (one oil and one watercolor).
  - Two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls of the exhibition room.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, we need to determine what else must be true.

Analysis:
  - If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Franz's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's watercolor.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so neither Franz's oil nor Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on wall 4.
  - Therefore, Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor must be displayed on one of the walls 1, 2, or 3, and Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on the remaining wall.
  - Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, Hidalgo must have at least one oil painting.
  - Since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, Hidalgo must have one oil painting and one watercolor painting on their wall.
  - Since Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of wall 4, and no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, Isaacs's oil must be displayed in the upper position of one of the walls 1, 2, or 3.

Action: Answer("C") - Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students who will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")  
If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, Greene's oil must be displayed with Hidalgo's paintings. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's watercolor, which means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position. Thus, the answer is (C) Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.

Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Analysis: 
  - We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of that wall.
  - We also know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so the wall on which Greene's oil and Franz's watercolor are displayed must also have at least one oil painting.
  - We do not know anything about the placement of Hidalgo's or Isaacs's paintings, except that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.

  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the possible locations for these two businesses are (1,2) or (6,7).
  
Analysis:
  - If the optometrist is at space 1, then the shoe store must be at space 2. Therefore, the pharmacy must be at space 7, and one of the restaurants must be at space 3, 4, or 5. However, in this case, it is not possible to satisfy the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, this case is not possible.
  - If the optometrist is at space 6, then the shoe store must be at space 5. Therefore, the pharmacy must be at space 1, and one of the restaurants must be at space 3, 4, or 7. The only way to satisfy the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses is to have the two restaurants at spaces 3 and 7, with the toy store at space 4 and the veterinarian at space 2.

Analysis:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the shoe store must be in either space 2 or space 6. 
  If the shoe store is in space 2, then the optometrist must be in space 1 or space 3. 
  However, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist cannot be in space 1. 
  Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 3. 
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 4 or space 2. 
  Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 7. 
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the pharmacy must be in space 1. 
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the two restaurants must be in spaces 4 and 6. 
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store must be the pharmacy and the toy store.

    - Optometrist is in space 2 and shoe store is in space 1 or 3.
    - Optometrist is in space 6 and shoe store is in space 5 or 7.
    
Analysis:
  - If the optometrist is in space 2 and shoe store is in space 1 or 3, then the pharmacy must be in space 7 and one of the restaurants must be in space 4. The other restaurant cannot be in space 5 because that would violate the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the other restaurant must be in space 6. The toy store cannot be in space 4 or 5 because it cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 1. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the toy store.
  - If the optometrist is in space 6 and shoe store is in space 5 or 7, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 and one of the restaurants must be in space 4.

Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Three kinds of cookies are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are a total of 14 batches of cookies made from Monday to Friday.
  - Since exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, there are a total of 9 batches of cookies made for each kind of cookie.
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, which means the first and third batches of sugar cookies are made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday.
  - Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday.
  - Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday.
  - Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Thursday.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. This leaves one batch of sugar cookies to be made on Friday. Therefore, choice D is correct.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  2. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  3. Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  4. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  5. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

  7. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Analysis:
  1. If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the number of batches made on Monday through Thursday is 11.
  2. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so the number of batches made on Tuesday through Friday is 10.
  3. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made before the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  4. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first and third batches of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday.
  5. If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday or Friday, which is not possible because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  6. If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, which is not possible because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  7. If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is not possible because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  8. If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is not possible because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  9. If the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday, which satisfies all the conditions.

  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the other two batches of cookies must have been made on Monday through Thursday.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first and third batches of sugar cookies must have been made on Monday through Wednesday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies must have been made on Monday or Tuesday.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Wednesday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday or Thursday. The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday, so it must be made on Monday. The second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, which means the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday. Finally, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. Therefore, (C) is the correct answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Three kinds of cookies are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.

  - Since there are three batches of each kind of cookie made each week, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, each day of the week must have one batch of each kind of cookie.
  - We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first and third batches of sugar cookies must be made on Monday and Wednesday (in some order).
  - Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and the first and third batches of sugar cookies must be made on Monday and Wednesday, respectively, the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  - We also know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Since we don't know when the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made, we can't determine when the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The shoe store is in space 4.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  Since the shoe store is in space 4, the only possible locations for the pharmacy and the restaurant are spaces 1 and 7. 
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the restaurant must be in space 7, and vice versa. 
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2, and the other one must be in space 3. 
  If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6, and the other one must be in space 5. 
  In either case, the toy store cannot be in space 3 or 5, so it must be in space 2 or 6. 
  Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, neither restaurant can be in space 2 or 6. 
  Therefore, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or 6, and the other one must be in space 3 or 5. 
  If the optometrist or the veterinarian is in space 2, then the other one must be in space 3, and vice versa. 
  In either case, the only remaining space for the second restaurant is space 7 or space 1. 
  Therefore, the following must be true:
    - The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
    - The optometrist is not next to a restaurant.
    - The toy store is not next to the veterinarian.
  This means that the answer is B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or 7.
  
Analysis:
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the optometrist and the veterinarian cannot be in spaces 3 and 5 because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the optometrist and the veterinarian must be in spaces 2 and 6 in some order. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7. If the pharmacy is in space 1, then one of the restaurants must be in space 7, but this is not possible because one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7 and one of the restaurants must be in space 1. The other restaurant must be in space 3 or 5. If the other restaurant is in space 3, then the toy store must be in space 2, which is not possible because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the other restaurant must be in space 5 and the toy store must be in space 6.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row in the shopping center.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end and one restaurant at the other end.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the businesses in spaces 3 and 5 must not be restaurants. Therefore, the two restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 7, and the pharmacy must be in space 2 or 6. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist in space 2 and the veterinarian must be in space 3. Therefore, the answer is B: the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: 
If the shoe store is in space 4, then we know that the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or 7 because it must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in either space 2 or 6. We also know that the shoe store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or 5. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in either space 1 or 7. If the veterinarian is in space 1, then the pharmacy must be in space 2 and the optometrist must be in space 3. This means that a restaurant must be in space 7, which violates the constraint that one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 7, the pharmacy must be in space 6, and the optometrist must be in space 5. This means that one of the restaurants must be in space 1, and the other restaurant must be in space 2 or 4. If the other restaurant is in space 2, then the toy store must be in space 3, which violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the other restaurant must be in space 4, and the toy store must be in space 2. This means that the shoe store is next to the pharmacy, and the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. Therefore, Answer("B") is correct.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then we know that the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 1 and 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, we know that the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6. If the optometrist is in space 2, then the veterinarian must be in space 3 or space 5, but the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian must be in space 5. This means that the restaurant must be in space 7, and the other restaurant must be in space 3. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1, and the veterinarian must be in space 6. This satisfies all of the constraints. Thus, we can conclude that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, and the correct answer is B.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The shopping center has exactly seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then we know that the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or space 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist. This means that the veterinarian must be in space 3 or space 5. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the only possible arrangement is:
  
  [Pharmacy] [Optometrist] [Veterinarian] [Shoe store] [Restaurant] [Toy store] [Restaurant]
  
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, and the answer is B.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
If the shoe store is in space 4, the businesses in spaces 3 and 5 must not be the toy store or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in either space 2 or space 6, and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 3 or space 5. If the veterinarian is in space 3, then the optometrist is in space 2, and the restaurant that is not at the end must be in space 7. This means that the other restaurant must be in space 6, and the toy store must be in space 1. Therefore, the answer is not A, C, D, or E. The only option left is B, which states that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, which is true.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The shoe store is in space 4.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or 7 because it must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 2 or 6. If the pharmacy is in space 2, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 1. If the pharmacy is in space 6, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 7. In either case, one of the restaurants must be in space 3 or 5, and the other restaurant must be in space 7 or 1. The toy store cannot be in space 3 or 5 because it cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the toy store must be in space 1 or 7. If the toy store is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2, and if the toy store is in space 7, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6. In either case, the shoe store is not next to the toy store. Therefore, the correct answer is A or B.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, we can deduce that the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, we can conclude that the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6. Therefore, the toy store cannot be in space 3 or space 5, and it must be in space 7 or space 1. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, we can conclude that the two restaurants must be in space 3 and space 6. Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 5. This means that the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, so the correct answer is B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row, numbered 1 through 7.
  - There are seven businesses: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Since the shoe store is in space 4, we know that there are businesses in spaces 3 and 5. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so neither of the restaurants can be in spaces 3 or 5. Therefore, the restaurants must be in spaces 1, 2, 6, or 7. However, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, so the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7. The pharmacy must also be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in either space 2 or space 6. However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the optometrist must be in either space 2 or space 4, and the veterinarian must be in either space 6 or space 4. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, so the answer is B.

Knowledge:
  There are six colors of thread available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Solution:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each of those rugs must be woven in a single color. 
  Let's consider each option:
  A: If forest and peach are used in a solid rug, then we cannot use olive, turquoise, and yellow in any of the rugs. But we need to use at least two of these colors in a multicolored rug, which is a contradiction. Therefore, A is not possible.
  B: If forest and yellow are used in a solid rug, then we cannot use olive, peach, and turquoise in any of the rugs. But we need to use at least two of these colors in a multicolored rug, which is a contradiction. Therefore, B is not possible.
  C: If peach and turquoise are used in a solid rug, then we cannot use forest, olive, and yellow in any of the rugs. But we need to use at least two of these colors in a multicolored rug, which is a contradiction. Therefore, C is not possible.
  D: If peach and yellow are used in a solid rug, then we cannot use forest, olive, and turquoise in any of the rugs. But we need to use at least two of these colors in a multicolored rug, which is a contradiction. Therefore, D is not possible.
  E: If turquoise and yellow are used in a solid rug, then we cannot use forest, olive, and peach in any of the rugs. But we need to use at least two of these colors in a multicolored rug, which is a contradiction. Therefore, E is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find a pair of colors that cannot be used together in a solid rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each solid rug will use only one color.
  We need to check the given rules to find the pair of colors that cannot be used together in a solid rug.
  The rules are:
    1. In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
    2. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
    3. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
    4. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
    5. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
    
Analysis:
  Let's analyze each option:
  A. forest and peach
    If we use forest and peach in a solid rug, we can use olive, turquoise, and yellow in the other rug. This combination satisfies all the given rules. Therefore, A is not the correct answer.
  B. forest and yellow
    If we use forest and yellow in a solid rug, we can use olive, peach, and turquoise in the other rug. This combination satisfies all the given rules. Therefore, B is not the correct answer.
  C. peach and turquoise
    If we use peach and turquoise in a solid rug, we cannot use olive in the other rug because olive must be used with peach. We cannot use yellow in the other rug because peach and yellow cannot be used together. We cannot use forest in the other rug because forest and turquoise cannot be used together. Therefore, C is a possible answer.
  D. peach and yellow
    If we use peach and yellow in a solid rug, we cannot use olive in the other rug because olive must be used with peach. We cannot use turquoise in the other rug because peach and turquoise cannot be used together. We cannot use forest in the other rug because forest and yellow cannot be used together. Therefore, D is a possible answer.
  E. turquoise and yellow
    If we use turquoise and yellow in a solid rug, we can use olive and peach in the other rug. This combination satisfies all the given rules. Therefore, E is not the correct answer.
    
Answer: Answer("C") or Answer("D") are both possible answers.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 colors of thread available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly 5 of the colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  We are looking for two solid rugs that cannot have certain colors.
  
Analysis:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each rug will have only one color.
  If a color is used in a solid rug, it cannot be used in any other rug.
  We need to find two solid rugs that cannot have certain colors.
  We can eliminate any color that has to be used with another color in a rug.
  We can also eliminate any two colors that cannot be used together in a rug.
  
Elimination:
  A: forest and peach - Peach is used with olive, so it cannot be used in a solid rug with forest.
  B: forest and yellow - Yellow cannot be used with peach, so it cannot be used in a solid rug with forest.
  C: peach and turquoise - Turquoise cannot be used with peach, so it cannot be used in a solid rug with peach.
  D: peach and yellow - Peach cannot be used with yellow, so it cannot be used in a solid rug with yellow.
  E: turquoise and yellow - None of these colors have been eliminated yet.
  
Action: Answer("E")

  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each solid rug must use only one color.
  We can eliminate the colors that cannot be used together in a rug.
  We can also eliminate the colors that cannot be used in a solid rug with white.
  We are left with the following combinations of two colors that can be used in a solid rug:
    - forest and olive
    - forest and turquoise
    - olive and peach
    - olive and yellow
    - turquoise and white
    - white and yellow
Action: Answer("C")  
  The colors peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot be the colors of the two solid rugs.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are six colors of thread available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  There are exactly two solid rugs.
  
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each of those rugs will be woven in a single color. 
  We can eliminate any answer choice that includes both colors that cannot be used together in a rug.
  A: forest and peach cannot be used together in a rug.
  B: forest and yellow can be used together in a rug.
  C: peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.

  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be exactly three colors used in each rug.
  If white is used in one of the solid rugs, then two other colors must be used in that rug, and the remaining two colors must be used in the other solid rug.
  If olive is used in one of the solid rugs, then peach must be used in that rug, and the remaining three colors must be used in the other solid rug.
  If forest is used in one of the solid rugs, then turquoise cannot be used in that rug, so it must be used in the other solid rug, and the remaining three colors must be used in that rug.
  If peach is used in one of the solid rugs, then yellow cannot be used in that rug, so it must be used in the other solid rug, and the remaining three colors must be used in that rug.
  If turquoise is used in one of the solid rugs, then peach cannot be used in that rug, so it must be used in the other solid rug, and the remaining three colors must be used in that rug.

Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: Verma could be the project leader if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The project leader must be one of the three selected workers.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. 
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member. 
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then the other two project members must be selected from Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue. 
  
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. - This means Smith cannot be a project member, which contradicts the fact that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected. - This means Taylor cannot be a project member, which contradicts the fact that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected. - This means Smith and Taylor cannot be project members, which means that Wells and Xue must be the other two project members. This is possible, so this choice is a possibility.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected. - This means Smith and Xue cannot be project members, which means that Taylor and Wells must be the other two project members. This is possible, so this choice is a possibility.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected. - This means Taylor and Wells cannot be project members, which contradicts the fact that if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The project leader must be one of the three selected project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.

Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Verma must be one of the three selected project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader.
  Therefore, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be project members.
  This leaves only Xue as the third project member.
  Therefore, the only way Verma could be the project leader is if Verma is the third project member and the answer is None of the Above.

  If Verma is selected as a project member, then neither Wells nor Ruiz can be selected.
  If Verma is selected as a project leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be selected as a project member.
  
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. --> If Smith is not selected, then Taylor is not selected. If Taylor is not selected, then Smith is not a project member. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader. This is not true.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected. --> If Taylor is not selected, then Smith is not a project member. Therefore, Verma can be a project member and Quinn or Ruiz can be the project leader. This is a possibility.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected. --> If Smith is not selected, then Taylor is not selected. If Taylor is not selected, then Smith is not a project member. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader. This is not true.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected. --> This does not provide any information about whether Verma can be the project leader. This is not useful.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected. --> If Wells is not selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader. This is not true.

Elimination:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is not selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader because Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader if they are selected. Eliminate A.
  If Ruiz or Taylor is not selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader because if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Eliminate B.
  If Smith or Taylor is not selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Eliminate C.
  If Smith or Xue is not selected, it does not help us determine if Verma could be the project leader or not. Keep D.
  If Taylor or Wells is not selected, then Verma could be the project leader because if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Answer is E.

Action: Answer("E")

  The project leader must be one of the three selected project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Verma must be one of the three selected project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member if Verma is the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members if Verma is the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.

  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. So, if Verma is selected as the project leader, Wells cannot be a project member. Therefore, choice E is not possible.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, he must be the project leader. So, if neither Quinn nor Ruiz is selected, Verma could be the project leader. Therefore, the answer is A.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The project leader must be one of the three selected project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Verma must be one of the three selected project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  Therefore, the three selected project members are Smith, Taylor, and Verma (who is the project leader).
  This means that Quinn and Ruiz cannot be project members.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have 3 members and 1 leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then she cannot be a project member. Therefore, there must be two other project members. 
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member. Therefore, the third project member cannot be Smith or Taylor. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, the third project member cannot be Ruiz or Verma. 
  This means that the third project member must be one of Quinn, Smith, Taylor, or Xue. 
  
A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the third project member must be Taylor or Xue. However, if Taylor is selected, then Smith must also be selected, which violates the constraints. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then the third project member must be Quinn, Smith, or Xue. If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected, which violates the constraints. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then the third project member must be Quinn, Wells, or Xue. If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be the project leader, which violates the constraints. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then the third project member must be Quinn, Taylor, or Wells. If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be the project leader, which violates the constraints. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then the third project member must be Quinn, Smith, or Xue. If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected, which violates the constraints. Therefore, Verma can be the project leader if neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The project leader must be one of the three project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Verma must be one of the three project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  Therefore, the three project members must be chosen from Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, and Xue.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then that person must be the project leader.
  Therefore, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member.
  If Smith and Taylor are project members, then Xue must also be a project member.
  Therefore, the three project members must be Smith, Taylor, and Xue.
  Therefore, Verma cannot be a project leader.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it must be to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship. Also, if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship. However, we don't know anything about Jaramillo being assigned to an ambassadorship, so we cannot say for sure whether Kayne will be assigned to an ambassadorship or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about whether Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship or not. Hence, the correct answer is D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that either Jaramillo or Ong must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. However, if Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne must also be assigned as ambassador to one of the countries, which would violate the constraint that Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, and so it must be the case that Jaramillo is not assigned to any ambassadorship. Thus, the correct answer is D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Action: Answer("D")
If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. However, Kayne is already assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. So, Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong is not assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that Jaramillo can only be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, which implies that Jaramillo and Kayne will be assigned to different ambassadorships. Therefore, Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship. Thus, the correct answer is D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must be assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it must be to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships is to not assign Jaramillo to any ambassadorship. Thus, Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, which means that choice D is the correct answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, the only remaining option is that Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo is assigned to another ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Landon is not assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong is not assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, according to the given constraints.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
- Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Action: 
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the three ambassadorships. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned to the remaining ambassadorship, which is Venezuela, because if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Also, if Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia. 

Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any of the ambassadorships. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships. 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, because if he were, Kayne would have to be assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which is not possible. Hence, Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship. Thus, the correct answer is D.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To determine who performs the third solo, we can use the following logic:
- The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
- The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does, so the percussionist must perform either the first or second solo.
- The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does, so the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo.
- The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist must perform the third solo. If the trumpeter performs the first solo, then the saxophonist must perform the fourth solo.

Therefore, the only member who CANNOT perform the third solo is the violinist, because the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo, and the saxophonist must perform either the third or fourth solo. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The third solo must be performed after the percussionist and before the guitarist.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player could perform the third solo.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist could perform the third solo.
  - The trumpeter and violinist do not have any restrictions that would prevent them from performing the third solo.
  
Action: Answer("A") - The guitarist cannot perform the third solo.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  We are asked to identify the member who CANNOT perform the third solo. 

Elimination:
  - The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, so they must perform either the first, second, or third solo. 
  - The percussionist must perform a solo before the keyboard player does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform either the first or second solo.
  - The keyboard player must perform a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo.
  - The saxophonist must perform a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform either the second, third, fourth, or fifth solo.
  - The violinist can perform either the first or second solo.
  
  If the saxophonist performs the second solo, then the percussionist must perform the first solo, the violinist must perform the third solo, and the keyboard player must perform the fourth solo, which means the guitarist must perform the fifth solo. This is a valid arrangement, so the saxophonist can perform the second solo.
  
  If the saxophonist performs the fourth solo, then the percussionist must perform the first solo, the violinist must perform the second solo, and the keyboard player must perform the third solo. However, this would mean that the guitarist must perform the fourth solo, which is not allowed. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the fourth solo.
  
  This leaves us with the following possible arrangements:
  1. Percussionist, Saxophonist, Violinist, Keyboard player, Guitarist, Trumpeter
  2. Percussionist, Saxophonist, Violinist, Keyboard player, Trumpeter, Guitarist
  3. Saxophonist, Percussionist, Violinist, Keyboard player, Guitarist, Trumpeter
  4. Saxophonist, Percussionist, Violinist, Keyboard player, Trumpeter, Guitarist
  
  In all of these arrangements, the third solo is performed by the violinist. Therefore, the answer is E: violinist.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To determine who performs the third solo, we can use the following logic:
- The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so the percussionist cannot perform the third solo.
- The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo if the percussionist performs the first solo, because the saxophonist would have to perform after both the percussionist and the trumpeter. So, if the saxophonist performs the third solo, then the trumpeter must perform the first solo.
- The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist. Therefore, the keyboard player cannot perform the third solo if the violinist performs the first solo, because the keyboard player would have to perform after both the violinist and the guitarist. So, if the keyboard player performs the third solo, then the violinist must perform the first solo.

Using this logic, we can eliminate some choices:
- The percussionist cannot perform the third solo, so choices C, D, and E are still possible.
- The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, so choice A is still possible.
- The keyboard player can perform the third solo only if the violinist performs the first solo, so choice B is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Each member of the band performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: If the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, then the guitarist can only perform the first, second, or third solo. However, if the guitarist performs the first or second solo, then the keyboard player cannot perform a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist, which violates one of the restrictions. Therefore, the guitarist cannot perform the third solo.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To find out who cannot perform the third solo, we need to determine the order of the solos for the other five members.

Possible order of solos:
1. percussionist
2. trumpeter
3. saxophonist
4. violinist
5. keyboard player
6. guitarist

With this order, all the restrictions are satisfied. Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("A")  - guitarist
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist, because the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the keyboard player, because the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the saxophonist, because the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the trumpeter, because the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after the trumpeter does.
  - The third solo must be performed by the violinist, because the keyboard player performs a solo at some time before the guitarist does, and the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To determine who performs the third solo, we can use the following logic:
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  - Therefore, the percussionist or the trumpeter must perform before the saxophonist.
  - The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  - Therefore, the keyboard player must perform either third or fourth.
  - If the keyboard player performs third, then the violinist performs first and the saxophonist performs after the percussionist.
  - If the keyboard player performs fourth, then the saxophonist performs after the trumpeter.
  - The guitarist cannot perform third because the guitarist does not perform fourth.

Action: Answer("A") - The guitarist cannot perform the third solo.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

To determine who performs the third solo, we can use the following logic:
- The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so the percussionist cannot perform the third solo.
- The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo if the percussionist performs the first solo, and the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo if the trumpeter performs the second solo.
- The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
- The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, so the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo.

Using this logic, we can eliminate the following options:
- A: The guitarist can perform the third solo, so this option is not correct.
- B: The keyboard player can perform the third solo, so this option is not correct.
- C: The saxophonist can perform the third solo if the percussionist performs the first solo and the trumpeter performs the second solo, so this option is not correct.
- D: The trumpeter can perform the third solo if the percussionist performs the first solo, so this option is not correct.
- E: The violinist cannot perform the third solo because the keyboard player must perform after the violinist, so this option is correct.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

  - The third solo cannot be performed by the keyboard player because they perform after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the saxophonist because they perform after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo if the percussionist performs before the trumpeter.
  - The third solo can be performed by either the percussionist or the trumpeter, as long as the saxophonist performs after the other one.
  - The third solo can be performed by the violinist as long as the keyboard player performs after them and before the guitarist.

  We know that the fifth audition must be recorded and the fourth audition cannot be recorded. Therefore, the fourth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's, and the fifth audition must be the other one. 
  We also know that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition cannot be the fifth audition. 
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Trillo's audition cannot be the sixth audition. 
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Yoshida's audition cannot be the sixth audition. 
  Therefore, the only option left is Waite's audition.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) has exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section (due to the constraint that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section). Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, it follows that Fuentes must have exactly one photograph in the Metro section and exactly one photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon, and the answer is (B).
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) has to have exactly two photographs.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs in the newspaper.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
  - The other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes (because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section).
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so Gagnon cannot have a photograph in the Sports section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Since one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue and one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes, the other photograph in the Sports section must also be by Fuentes.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  Answer: A
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 photographs in total, 2 in each of the 3 sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer must have at least 1 photograph, but no more than 3 photographs.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
- There must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes, and at least one photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes.
- Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. - This could be true, but it is not a necessary conclusion from the given information.
B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. - This could be true, but it is not a necessary conclusion from the given information.
C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. - This is not possible since Gagnon already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section.
D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. - This could be true, but it is not a necessary conclusion from the given information.
E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - This is not possible since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. This is because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and Gagnon and Hue are not in the Metro section. Therefore, Fuentes must be in the Metro section, and since there are only two photographs per section, Fuentes can have at most one photograph in the Metro section. This means that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon, so the answer is B.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) has exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section to satisfy the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. However, since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and we know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then neither Gagnon nor Hue can have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the only possibility is that both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, which means that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. Thus, the correct answer is (B) Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
Response 5:

  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, then Fuentes must have exactly one photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Thus, the answer is B.

  - Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. This is because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since Gagnon and Hue each have one photograph in the Lifestyle section, the third photographer, Fuentes, must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. However, since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, it follows that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) has to have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes. This means that Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section and at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, Fuentes cannot have both photographs in the Sports section. Since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, and Hue and Fuentes have to have the same number of photographs in the Sports section, it follows that Hue cannot have both photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon (and the other one is by Fuentes). Answer: B.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.

  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have two photographs in the Metro section. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, then Hue must have one photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Thus, the answer is B.

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. This is because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section as well. Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and we know that Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section. This means that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon, and the other photograph in the Metro section is either by Fuentes or Hue. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.

  - Since no two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, we know that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on a different day than the first batch of oatmeal cookies.
  - Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  - Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, we know that at least one batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.
  - Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, and no two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day, we know that the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Friday.

- One batch of cookies must be made on Thursday.
- No batches of cookies can be made on Wednesday.

We can use the following deductions:

  A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
  B: Lateefah is a facilitator.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  - Two teams: Green and Red.
  - One team has two members, and the other has three members.
  - One member of each team will be designated as a facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Analysis:
  - Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, and there are only two teams, we know that the remaining team (the red team) has two members, and one of them is Olga.
  - Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga, Juana must be assigned to the green team.
  - Since Kelly is not a facilitator, and there is only one facilitator per team, Kelly must be on the red team.
  - Since Olga is a facilitator, and she is on the red team, the other member of the red team cannot be a facilitator.
  - Since Mei is the only student left, and there are already two members on the red team, Mei must be on the green team.

  - Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, Juana must be a member of a team with two members.
  - Therefore, Mei must be a member of the green team.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.

  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Analysis:
  - From the given information, we know that Lateefah is assigned to the green team, and Olga is a facilitator. Therefore, Olga must be the facilitator of the team that Lateefah is not on, which means Olga is assigned to the red team.
  - Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, Juana must be assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator, so Mei must be the facilitator of the green team.
  - Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The green team has Lateefah and two other members. 
  The red team has two members including Juana or Olga.
  Juana and Olga are not on the same team.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  
  A: It is possible that Juana is assigned to the red team, but it is not a must.
  B: Lateefah is assigned to the green team and not designated as a facilitator, so this statement is false.
  C: Olga is assigned to the red team as a facilitator, so this statement is false.
  D: Juana and Mei could both be assigned to the red team and not be facilitators, so this statement is false.

  One member of each team is a facilitator.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Since Olga is a facilitator, she must be on a team with two members. Lateefah is assigned to the green team, so the green team has two members and the red team has three members. Since Juana is on a different team than Olga, Juana must be on the red team. Therefore, Mei and Kelly are on the green team with Lateefah, and Olga and Juana are on the red team. Since Olga is a facilitator, Mei and Kelly cannot be facilitators. Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators, which means that D is the correct answer.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  - Two teams: green team and red team.

  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Analysis:
  - Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team has two members and the red team has three members.
  - Olga is a facilitator, so she must be on the red team with two members.
  - Juana cannot be on the red team with Olga, so Juana must be on the green team with Lateefah.

  The third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  Since J must be shown in the evening, J cannot be one of the first two houses shown in the morning. Therefore, J must be one of the last two houses shown in the evening. 
  Since K cannot be shown in the morning, K must be one of the houses shown in the afternoon or evening. 
  Since L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, L cannot be one of the first three houses shown (because K must be shown before L) or one of the last two houses shown (because M must be shown after L). Therefore, L must be one of the houses shown in the middle of the day.
  
Action: Answer("C")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is the only way to obtain a class 3 building.
  RealProp owns one class 1 building.
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
Action: Answer("B")  
If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings away. Since the only way to obtain a class 2 building is to trade a class 2 building, Southco must have traded with Trustcorp at least once to obtain its class 2 building. Therefore, Southco cannot own only class 2 buildings, so option B is false. Option A is true because RealProp owns the Garza Tower, which is a class 1 building. Option C may or may not be true, but there is no way to determine this from the given information. Option D is false because RealProp owns the Garza Tower, not Trustcorp. Option E is false because RealProp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
Analysis:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings at the beginning, so it must have traded them all away.
  The only way for Trustcorp to trade away all of its class 2 buildings is to trade them for class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have made at least one trade of a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  This means that Southco must have made at least one trade with Trustcorp, and that it must have traded away its Lynch Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower), so option A is true.
  There is no information to support option B, D, or E.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - RealProp owns 3 buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  - Southco owns 2 buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  - Trustcorp owns 3 buildings: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  - Trades must be one of three kinds: (1) Trading one building for one other building of the same class, (2) Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or (3) Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  - Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Solution: 
  - Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  - If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, it will no longer own any class 2 buildings.
  - Therefore, Trustcorp must have made at least one trade of a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  - This means that Southco must have traded one of its class 2 buildings (Lynch Building) with Trustcorp for two of Trustcorp's class 3 buildings.
  - RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower), but it also owns two class 3 buildings, so we cannot conclude that RealProp owns only class 1 buildings.
  - Southco still owns the Flores Tower, which is a class 1 building, so we cannot conclude that Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  - We cannot conclude that Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower or the Zimmer House, as these buildings are owned by RealProp.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings, then Southco cannot own only class 2 buildings, because it owns only one class 2 building. Therefore, B is not true.
  If Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings, then Southco must have made at least one trade with Trustcorp, because Trustcorp has no class 2 buildings left to trade with RealProp. Therefore, C is true.
  If Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings, then Trustcorp cannot own the Garza Tower, because it is a class 1 building. Therefore, D is not true.
  If Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings, then Trustcorp cannot own the Zimmer House, because it is a class 3 building. Therefore, E is not true.
  If Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings, then RealProp must own a class 1 building, because Trustcorp has no class 2 buildings left to trade with. Therefore, A is true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns 3 buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns 2 buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means that Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  Southco only has one class 2 building, the Lynch Building, and it cannot have traded with Trustcorp for it because Trustcorp has no class 2 buildings left to trade.
  RealProp has no class 2 buildings to trade for two class 3 buildings, so it must have traded a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp must have traded the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings, and now it only has the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  None of the given choices state that RealProp owns only class 3 buildings or that Trustcorp owns only class 1 or 3 buildings.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns 3 buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns 2 buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  RealProp owns only one class 1 building, so it cannot have traded with Trustcorp for two class 2 buildings. 
  Southco owns only one class 1 building, so it cannot have traded with Trustcorp for two class 2 buildings. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded one of its class 2 buildings with RealProp or Southco for a class 1 building. 
  If Trustcorp traded its King Building (class 2) with RealProp or Southco for a class 1 building, then it would still own two class 2 buildings (Meyer Building and Ortiz Building). 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded its Meyer Building or Ortiz Building (class 2) with RealProp or Southco for a class 1 building. 
  If Trustcorp traded its Meyer Building (class 2) with RealProp or Southco for a class 1 building, then it would still own the Ortiz Building (class 2). 
  If Trustcorp traded its Ortiz Building (class 2) with RealProp or Southco for a class 1 building, then it would still own the Meyer Building (class 2). 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded either the Meyer Building or Ortiz Building (class 2) with RealProp or Southco for a class 1 building, and it still owns the other class 2 building.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower), and two class 3 buildings (Yates House and Zimmer House).
  Southco owns a class 1 building (Flores Tower) and a class 2 building (Lynch Building).
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings (King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building).
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means that Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  - RealProp cannot trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, because it only has one class 1 building.
  - Southco cannot trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, because it only has one class 1 building.
  - Trustcorp can trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, but this will not change the fact that Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after the trade.
  - If Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp, then Trustcorp must have received a class 2 building in exchange for one of its buildings, which contradicts the fact that Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  - The only possibility is that Trustcorp has traded one of its class 2 buildings for a class 1 building, and then traded the other two class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings. This means that RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower), and Southco owns only class 2 buildings (Lynch Building).
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means that Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings, then it must have traded them for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  If Trustcorp has traded a class 2 building for a class 1 building, then RealProp must own a class 1 building, which satisfies option A. 
  If Trustcorp has traded a class 2 building for a class 3 building, then Trustcorp must own a class 3 building, which contradicts the given information. 
  If Trustcorp has traded two class 2 buildings for two class 1 buildings, then Southco must own two class 1 buildings, which contradicts the given information. 
  If Trustcorp has traded a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, then Southco must have made a trade with Trustcorp, which satisfies option C.
  If Trustcorp has traded a class 3 building for two class 2 buildings, then it is not clear which building RealProp owns, so options A, D, and E cannot be determined. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for other buildings.
  A: It is possible that RealProp owns a class 1 building, but we cannot be certain.
  B: Southco owns at least one class 1 building, so this statement is false.
  C: If Trustcorp traded a class 2 building with Southco, then Trustcorp would still own at least one class 2 building. Therefore, this statement is false.
  D: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, not Trustcorp. Therefore, this statement is false.
  E: The Zimmer House is owned by RealProp, not Trustcorp. Therefore, this statement is false.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings. 
  The only way for Trustcorp to trade all of its class 2 buildings is to trade them for class 3 buildings, since there are no other class 2 buildings available for trading.
  Therefore, Southco must have traded with Trustcorp, since Southco is the only company that owns class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owning a class 1 building, Southco owning only class 2 buildings, Trustcorp owning the Garza Tower, or Trustcorp owning the Zimmer House are all possible, but not necessarily true, outcomes of the trades.

  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and two in some order.
  
Analysis:
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and two in some order.
  - Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot five because it is one of the last three slots.
  - Vegemite cannot perform in slot three because it is after Wellspring and Zircon.
  - Wellspring cannot perform in slot three because it must perform in slot one or two.
  - Zircon could perform in slot two, which means Uneasy would perform in slot six.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Landon
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Novetzke
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela and Zambia, but it is not clear which ambassador is assigned to which country. Finally, either Novetzke or Kayne must be assigned to Yemen, but not both. Therefore, Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen, and Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. Landon must be assigned to the remaining country, which is Zambia.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This means that Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela, Yemen, or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. This means that Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela and one of the other two countries. Since Landon must be assigned to Zambia, Novetzke must be assigned to the remaining country. Therefore, the answer is B: Jaramillo and Novetzke.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela and Zambia, but it is not clear which one is assigned to which country. Finally, either Novetzke or Kayne must be assigned to Yemen, but not both. Therefore, Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The candidates for the ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong.
  - One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne and Novetzke are the only candidates left for Yemen and Zambia. However, either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, one of them will be assigned to Yemen and the other to Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned to Venezuela, and Kayne must be assigned to either Yemen or Zambia. Finally, if Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Reasoning:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must be assigned to the other. Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne are assigned to Venezuela and Zambia, but it is not clear which one is assigned to which country. Finally, either Novetzke or Kayne is assigned to Yemen. Since Kayne is already assigned to another country, Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned as ambassadors. Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. Either Novetzke or Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Since Kayne is already assigned to Venezuela or Zambia, Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela and Zambia, but it is not clear which one is assigned to which country. Finally, Landon must be assigned to Zambia. Since either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen. Therefore, the answer is B: Jaramillo and Novetzke.

  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
  This means that Kayne could be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia, and Novetzke could be assigned to either Yemen or Zambia. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. This means that if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne would be assigned to the remaining ambassadorship between Venezuela and Zambia.

  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. This means that Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela and Zambia, but it is not clear who will be assigned to Yemen.
  If Novetzke is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships. This means that Novetzke must be assigned to either Venezuela, Yemen, or Zambia. If Novetzke is assigned to Yemen, then Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela and Zambia, respectively. If Novetzke is assigned to Venezuela or Zambia, then Jaramillo and Kayne can be assigned to any of the remaining ambassadorships.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia. This means that Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela and Yemen, but it is not clear who will be assigned to Zambia.

  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This means that Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must be assigned to the other. This leaves Novetzke, Landon, and the remaining country to be assigned. Since Landon is assigned to Zambia, Novetzke must be assigned to the remaining country, which is Yemen.

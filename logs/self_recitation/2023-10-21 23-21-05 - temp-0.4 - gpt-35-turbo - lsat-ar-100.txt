Response 0:
Knowledge:
  5 students - Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill - review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review Tamerlane. 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must review Undulation.
  Therefore, Megregian does not review Undulation.
  
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation. This is true.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. This is also true.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation. This is true.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. This is false, as Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian who reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. This is false, as O'Neill reviews Tamerlane.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  - Three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Each student reviews one or more of the three plays.
  - Kramer and Lopez < Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the two other students must review the same play or plays as each other. 
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation. If this were true, then Megregian would have to review both Tamerlane and Sunset. However, this would mean that Lopez and Kramer would have to review Undulation, which would violate the condition that only two students can review the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. If this were true, then Kramer and Lopez would have to review Undulation, which would violate the condition that only two students can review the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation. If this were true, then Megregian, Kramer, and Lopez would have to review the other two plays. This is possible, and it satisfies the conditions given in the problem. Therefore, C could be true.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. If this were true, then Megregian would have to review both Sunset and Undulation, which would mean that Kramer and O'Neill would have to review the same play or plays as each other. However, this would violate the condition that only two students can review the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. If this were true, then Kramer and Lopez would have to review Undulation, which would violate the condition that only two students can review the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, E cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review Tamerlane. Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill both review Undulation and the third student who reviews Undulation does not review Tamerlane.
  
  A: Megregian must review Tamerlane, so he cannot review Undulation. Eliminate.
  B: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so O'Neill cannot review Undulation. Eliminate.
  C: Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation. Eliminate.
  D: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so Lopez cannot review Tamerlane. This could be true.
  E: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so O'Neill cannot review Sunset. Eliminate.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
- Three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
- Each student reviews one or more of the three plays.
- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
- Exactly three students review Undulation.

Solution:
- If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so Megregian, Lopez, and Jiang must review Undulation.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
- Therefore, (C) Jiang reviews Undulation cannot be true.
- Megregian must review Undulation because Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
- If Megregian reviews Undulation, then (A) Megregian does not review Undulation cannot be true.
- If Megregian and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then (B) O'Neill does not review Undulation cannot be true.
- If Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then (D) Lopez reviews Tamerlane cannot be true.
- If Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then (E) O'Neill reviews Sunset cannot be true.
- Therefore, the only option that could be true is (A) Megregian does not review Undulation.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Analysis:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation.
  Therefore, if exactly three of the students review Undulation, then Jiang must review Undulation.
  This means that Megregian and Lopez cannot review Undulation.
  O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, so he cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that O'Neill does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  5 students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  They review exactly one or more of three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  A: We know that exactly two students review Tamerlane, so if three students review Undulation, then Megregian must be one of them. This means that Megregian does review Undulation. So, A cannot be true.
  B: We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so if three students review Undulation, then neither Kramer nor O'Neill can review Undulation. This means that O'Neill does not review Undulation. So, B could be true.
  C: We know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if three students review Undulation, then Jiang cannot review Undulation. This means that C cannot be true.
  D: We know that exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other, but we don't know which two students. So, D could be true.
  E: We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so if three students review Undulation, then neither Kramer nor O'Neill can review Sunset. This means that E cannot be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  5 students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review 1 or more of 3 plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly 2 students review the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly 3 students review Undulation, then the remaining 2 students must review either Sunset or Tamerlane.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly 3 students review Undulation, then the remaining 2 students must review either Sunset or Tamerlane. 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot review Sunset. 
  Therefore, the two students who review Sunset must be among Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, and Megregian.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then he cannot review both Sunset and Tamerlane. 
  If O'Neill reviews Undulation, then he cannot review Sunset. 
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then Megregian cannot review Undulation, and he must review Sunset, which means Kramer and Lopez must review Tamerlane. 
  If Lopez reviews Undulation, then Megregian cannot review Undulation, and he must review Sunset, which means Kramer and Jiang must review Tamerlane. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three students review Undulation.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  - Since exactly three students review Undulation, the other two students must review the same play or plays as each other.
  - Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, one of the students who reviewed Undulation must have reviewed Tamerlane as well.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, so he cannot review Undulation. Therefore, O'Neill does not review Undulation.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review Tamerlane. Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane and neither of them review Undulation. 
  Megregian reviews at least one play that is not reviewed by Lopez and Jiang. If Jiang reviews Undulation, then Megregian must review Tamerlane and Sunset. But this means that Kramer and O'Neill review the same play, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, Jiang does not review Undulation.
  
Solution:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation. (Possible)
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. (True)
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation. (False)
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. (False)
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. (False)

Action: Answer("B")

  5 students review 3 plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill both review Undulation.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then Lopez and Jiang cannot review any of the three plays.
  If Megregian does not review Undulation, then Lopez and Jiang must review Undulation.
  Therefore, O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  Jiang cannot review Undulation if Megregian does not review Undulation.
  Lopez cannot review Tamerlane since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.

    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If a 3-day voicemail target is set for one of the clients, then there cannot be another client with a shorter voicemail target. This is because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, a 3-day voicemail target cannot be set for more than one of the clients. All the other targets can be set for more than one of the clients.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  The Flores Tower can only be traded for one of the two class 1 buildings, Garza Tower or Flores Tower.
  The Lynch Building can only be traded for one of the two class 3 buildings, Yates House or Zimmer House.
  The King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building can only be traded for one of the two class 1 buildings, Garza Tower or Flores Tower.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is between the Garza Tower and the Flores Tower.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  Option A: The Flores Tower is a class 1 building owned by Southco, so it cannot be traded for the Garza Tower which is also a class 1 building owned by RealProp. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  Option B: The Garza Tower is a class 1 building owned by RealProp, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings. The King Building and the Ortiz Building are class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp, so they could be traded for the Garza Tower. However, the Yates House and the Zimmer House are class 3 buildings owned by RealProp, so they cannot be traded for a class 1 building. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  Option C: The Garza Tower is a class 1 building owned by RealProp, and the Flores Tower is a class 1 building owned by Southco. They could be traded for each other. The Yates House and the Zimmer House are class 3 buildings owned by RealProp, and they could be traded for two class 3 buildings. The King Building and the Meyer Building are class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp, and they could be traded for the Yates House and the Zimmer House. Therefore, this option is possible.
  Option D: The Garza Tower is a class 1 building owned by RealProp, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings. The Meyer Building is a class 2 building owned by Trustcorp, so it cannot be traded for the Garza Tower. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  Option E: The Garza Tower is a class 1 building owned by RealProp, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings. The King Building and the Ortiz Building are class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp, so they could be traded for the Garza Tower. The Yates House and the Zimmer House are class 3 buildings owned by RealProp, so they cannot be traded for a class 2 building. Therefore, this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  The Flores Tower is the only class 1 building owned by any of the three companies. 
  Therefore, a class 1 building cannot be traded for two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings.
  The Yates House and Zimmer House are both class 3 buildings owned by RealProp, so they cannot be traded for a class 2 building.
  The King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building are all class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp, so they cannot be traded for a class 1 building.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is for a building of the same class.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  After one trade, each company will still own three buildings.
  
Analysis:
  Option A is not possible because RealProp would need to trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, but they only have one class 1 building and Trustcorp only has class 2 buildings.
  Option B is not possible because RealProp would need to trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, but they only have one class 1 building and Trustcorp only has class 2 buildings.
  Option C is possible. RealProp could trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) and then Southco could trade the Flores Tower (class 1) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Option D is not possible because RealProp would need to trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, but they only have one class 1 building and Trustcorp only has class 2 buildings.
  Option E is not possible because RealProp would need to trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, but they only have one class 1 building and Trustcorp only has class 2 buildings.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:

  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
      - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
      - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
      - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Action: Answer("D")

  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Solution:
  We need to determine which of the answer choices is possible after only one trade is made. 
  Option A is not possible because RealProp has a class 1 building and Southco does not have any class 3 buildings to trade.
  Option B is not possible because RealProp has a class 3 building and Trustcorp does not have any class 1 buildings to trade.
  Option C is possible because each company has a building from each class and they can make trades within their respective classes.
  Option D is not possible because RealProp has a class 3 building and Trustcorp does not have any class 1 buildings to trade.
  Option E is not possible because RealProp has a class 1 building and Southco does not have any class 3 buildings to trade.
  
Action: Answer("C")

  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  After only one trade is made, each company will still own three buildings.
  If a class 1 building is traded, then the company that receives it must give away two class 2 buildings.
  If a class 2 building is traded, then the company that receives it must give away two class 3 buildings.
  If a class 3 building is traded, then the company that receives it must give away one class 2 building and one class 3 building.

Analysis:
  The Garza Tower is the only class 1 building, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The Flores Tower is the only other class 1 building, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The King Building is the only class 2 building owned by Trustcorp that is not part of a pair, so it can only be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is between RealProp and Trustcorp, with the Garza Tower being traded for the King Building and the Ortiz Building.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Solution:
  The Flores Tower is a class 1 building, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  The Garza Tower is a class 1 building, so it can only be traded for one class 1 building.
  The Lynch Building is a class 2 building, so it can be traded for one class 2 building or two class 3 buildings.
  The King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building are all class 2 buildings, so they can only be traded for one class 2 building or two class 3 buildings.

  Therefore, the only possible trade is:
    - RealProp trades the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower.
    - Southco trades the Lynch Building for the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
    - Trustcorp trades the King Building for the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building.

  After the trade, the buildings owned by the three companies are:
    - RealProp: the Flores Tower
    - Southco: the Yates House, the Zimmer House
    - Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Ortiz Building

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  - The Flores Tower is a class 1 building and Southco owns it, so it cannot be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  - RealProp owns only one class 1 building, so it cannot make a trade of type "Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings".
  - Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, so it cannot make a trade of type "Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings".
  - RealProp can trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for either the Flores Tower (class 1) or the Lynch Building (class 2).
  - If RealProp trades the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower, then Southco would own two class 1 buildings, which is not possible.
  - If RealProp trades the Garza Tower for the Lynch Building, then RealProp would own two class 3 buildings and Southco would own two class 1 buildings, which is possible.
  - Trustcorp can trade the King Building, the Meyer Building, or the Ortiz Building (all class 2) for either the Yates House (class 3) or the Zimmer House (class 3).
  - If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for the Yates House or the Zimmer House, then Trustcorp would own two class 3 buildings, which is not possible.

Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The clues are mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter, in the seven chapters of the mystery novel.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7.
  
A: R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
B: R can be mentioned in chapter 5 because there are no constraints on the placement of R.
C: S cannot be mentioned in chapter 7 because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
D: W can be mentioned in chapter 6 because W must be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7.
E: X cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 because U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once in one of the seven chapters.
  - T cannot be in chapter 1, and must be before W with two chapters in between.
  - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If U is in chapter 3, then T must be in chapter 2 or chapter 4. 
  - Since U and X must be in adjacent chapters, then X must be in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  - If X is in chapter 2, then W must be in chapter 6, and T must be in chapter 4. But this would mean that S and Z are in adjacent chapters, which is not allowed. Therefore, X must be in chapter 4, which means that W must be in chapter 7, and T must be in chapter 2. 
  - This leaves chapters 1, 5, and 6 for R, S, and Z. Since S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters, and W is in chapter 7, then S must be in chapter 5 and Z must be in chapter 6. Therefore, R must be in chapter 1.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The clues are mentioned in 7 chapters, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 2, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, so W must be mentioned in chapter 6. Then, T must be mentioned in chapter 5 and S must be mentioned in chapter 7. This leaves R to be mentioned in chapter 1, which is possible.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, so W must be mentioned in chapter 6. Then, T must be mentioned in chapter 5 and S must be mentioned in chapter 7. This leaves R to be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 5, which is possible.

Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. This means that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, so it must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. This means that if S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5 or earlier.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. This means that if W is mentioned in chapter 6, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4 or earlier.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4. This means that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, so it must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later. Since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, this means that W must be mentioned in chapter 6. This leaves R to be mentioned in chapter 1 or 5, and S and Z to be mentioned in chapters 2-4 and 5-6 (in some order). Therefore, W could be mentioned in chapter 6 (choice D).
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  2. Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  3. T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  4. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  5. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  6. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  7. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4. This is because U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, E is the correct answer.
  A cannot be true because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  B cannot be true because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  C cannot be true because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  D cannot be true because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each chapter mentions a different clue.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Solution:
If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then the only possible position for X is chapter 4. Therefore, W cannot be in chapter 3, and it must be in either chapter 5 or chapter 7, with T being in chapter 2 or chapter 4. 
A: R cannot be in chapter 1, because T cannot be in chapter 1.
B: R can be in chapter 5, because there are no restrictions on its position.
C: S cannot be in chapter 7, because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
D: W can be in chapter 6, because it is not adjacent to X.
E: X must be in chapter 4, because it is adjacent to U.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

We know that U is mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and W must be mentioned after T, with exactly two chapters separating them. So, T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or chapter 4, and W must be mentioned in either chapter 5 or chapter 7.

Option A: If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 7. However, this would mean that X must be mentioned in chapter 4, which violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, option A is not possible.

Option B: If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 7. This satisfies all the constraints, so option B is possible.

Option C: If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, option C is not possible.

Option D: If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and X must be mentioned in chapter 4, which violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, option D is not possible.

Option E: If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 7. This satisfies all the constraints, so option E is possible.

Action: Answer("B")

  - There are 7 clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be in chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. So, T cannot be in chapter 6 or 7.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, S cannot be in chapter 6 or 7, and Z cannot be in chapter 1 or 2.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, W cannot be in chapter 3 or 4, and X cannot be in chapter 3 or 5.

Action: 
  - R cannot be in chapter 1 or 5 because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. So, R can be in chapter 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7.
  - S cannot be in chapter 6 or 7, so it can be in chapter 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  - Z cannot be in chapter 1 or 2, so it can be in chapter 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  - W cannot be in chapter 3 or 4, so it can be in chapter 5, 6, or 7.
  - X cannot be in chapter 3 or 5, so it can be in chapter 2, 4, 6, or 7.

Therefore, the answer is E: X is mentioned in chapter 4. Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each chapter from 1 through 7 should have exactly one clue mentioned.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then we know that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, X must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 2, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 5, because that would mean W and X are mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and T must be mentioned in chapter 4. Then, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 3 in some order, and R must be mentioned in chapter 1. This satisfies all the constraints.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, because that would mean T and X are mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 6, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5. Then, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 3 in some order, and R must be mentioned in chapter 1. This also satisfies all the constraints.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each chapter from 1 to 7 must have a different clue.
  - T cannot be in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - T cannot be in chapter 1, so it must be in chapter 2 or 3.
  - If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5 and X must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the rule that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3, which means W must be mentioned in chapter 6 and X must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be in chapter 6 or 7.
  - Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 4, or 5, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 4, or 5.
  - R can be mentioned in any chapter that does not violate the given constraints.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4. T must be mentioned in chapter 3, which means W must be mentioned in chapter 6 and X must be mentioned in chapter 7. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be in chapter 6 or 7. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 4, or 5, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 4, or 5. R can be mentioned in any chapter that does not violate the given constraints. Therefore, W can be mentioned in chapter 6, which is answer choice D.

  From condition 3, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. 
  From condition 4, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. 
  Therefore, Megregian must be one of the two students who review the same play as either Kramer or O'Neill. 
  From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. 
  Therefore, Jiang cannot be the other student who reviews the same play as Megregian. 

Solution:
  The only possible pair of students who review the same play are Kramer and O'Neill. 
  Therefore, the accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane is: 
  Action: Answer("B")  Kramer, O'Neill.

  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 4, we know that there are only two possibilities for the students who review Tamerlane: 
  - Kramer and O'Neill
  - Two other students who review Tamerlane and each other play.

However, we also know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Since Jiang's reviews are not mentioned, we cannot determine which students are reviewing Sunset and Undulation. 

Option A is not possible because Jiang does not review any play reviewed by Kramer.
Option B is possible because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
Option C is not possible because Megregian must review fewer plays than Kramer and Lopez, but this option has all three of them reviewing Tamerlane.
Option D is not possible because it has three students reviewing Tamerlane.
Option E is not possible because it has three students reviewing Tamerlane.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill must be included in the list of students who review Tamerlane. 
Using condition 2, we know that Jiang cannot be included in the list of students who review Tamerlane. 
Using condition 3, we know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. Therefore, Megregian cannot be included in the list of students who review Tamerlane. 
Using condition 4, we know that the list must have exactly two students. 

Action: Answer("B") 
Therefore, the only possible list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill. Thus, the answer is B.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  They review exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  To determine who reviewed Tamerlane, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed it. Therefore, we need to find which option includes Kramer and O'Neill.
  
  A: Jiang and Kramer reviewed different plays, so this option is not possible.
  B: This option includes both Kramer and O'Neill, so it is possible.
  C: This option includes Kramer and O'Neill, but it also includes Lopez, who reviewed fewer plays than Megregian. This is not possible because Megregian must have reviewed fewer plays than Kramer and Lopez.
  D: This option includes Kramer and O'Neill, and also Megregian, who reviewed more plays than Kramer and Lopez. This is not possible because Megregian cannot review Tamerlane if Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed it.
  E: This option does not include Kramer or O'Neill, so it is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Based on condition 1, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
Based on condition 4, Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, so Megregian cannot be one of the students who review Tamerlane. 
Based on condition 2, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot be one of the students who review Tamerlane. 
Based on condition 3, exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, we need to find a pair of students who both review Tamerlane. 
Option A is not possible because Jiang cannot be one of the students who review Tamerlane. 
Option B is possible because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
Option C is not possible because all three students review Tamerlane, but condition 4 states that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. 
Option D is not possible because Megregian cannot be one of the students who review Tamerlane. 
Option E is not possible because neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Tamerlane. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 4, we know that there are exactly two students who review the same play or plays as each other. Since we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, we can eliminate choices A, C, and E because they do not include O'Neill. 

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Since we do not know which play Jiang reviews, we cannot eliminate any choices based on this condition.

Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, we can eliminate choice B because it only includes Kramer and O'Neill.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - Five students in total review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Analysis:
  - From the given conditions, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
  - Also, exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. This means that either Kramer or O'Neill must have reviewed Tamerlane with one other student.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means that Jiang cannot be one of the students who reviewed Tamerlane with Kramer or O'Neill.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. This means that Megregian must have reviewed all three plays, and Kramer and Lopez reviewed only one or two plays.
  
Solution:
  - The only option that satisfies the given conditions is B: Kramer, O'Neill. 
  - Therefore, Action: Answer("B")

  Trades can only be made between buildings of the same class or as specified in the three kinds of trades.
  
A: RealProp does not own the Flores Tower, so this cannot be true.
B: Southco does not own the Meyer Building and the Flores Tower, so this cannot be true.
C: Southco owns the Flores Tower, but it cannot trade it for the Garza Tower since they are not of the same class, so this cannot be true.
D: Trustcorp does not own the Flores Tower, so this cannot be true.
E: Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building, but it cannot trade it for the Garza Tower since they are not of the same class, so this cannot be true.

  B: Southco owns Flores Tower, but Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp, so this cannot be true.
  C: Southco owns Garza Tower and Lynch Building, but Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, so this cannot be true.
  D: Trustcorp owns Flores Tower and Ortiz Building, so this can be true.
  E: Trustcorp owns Garza Tower and Meyer Building, but Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, so this cannot be true.

    Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  A: RealProp does not own the Flores Tower, which is owned by Southco. RealProp owns the Garza Tower, which is class 1, and the Yates House and Zimmer House, which are both class 3. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: Southco owns the Flores Tower, which is class 1, and the Lynch Building, which is class 2. Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building, which is class 2. Therefore, B can be true if Southco trades the Lynch Building for the Meyer Building with Trustcorp.
  C: Southco owns the Flores Tower, which is class 1, and the Lynch Building, which is class 2. RealProp owns the Garza Tower, which is class 1. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  D: Trustcorp does not own the Flores Tower, which is owned by Southco. Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building, which are both class 2. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  E: RealProp owns the Garza Tower, which is class 1. Trustcorp does not own any class 1 building. Therefore, E cannot be true.
Action: Answer("A")

    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, which is a class 1 building. Southco owns the Flores Tower, which is also a class 1 building. Therefore, it is impossible for the buildings owned by RealProp to be the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower, as stated in choice A.
Response 5:

  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.

  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We need to find the option that is not possible, no matter how many trades are made.
  
Analysis:
  A: RealProp owns the Garza Tower, so this option is possible. However, RealProp does not own the Flores Tower, so this option is not possible.
  B: Southco owns the Flores Tower, so this option is possible. However, Southco does not own the Meyer Building, so this option is not possible.
  C: Southco owns the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, so this option is possible.
  D: Trustcorp does not own the Flores Tower, so this option is not possible.
  E: Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower, so this option is not possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  1. If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday (because Hong does not testify on Monday).
  2. If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday (because at least one witness testifies on Monday and Hong does not testify on Monday).
  3. Therefore, Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday.
  4. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Garcia must testify on Monday.
  
Knowledge:
  A: Franco cannot testify on Monday if Hong testifies on Tuesday.
  B: Garcia must testify on Monday if Franco and Hong testify on Tuesday.
  C: Garcia cannot testify on Wednesday because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  D: Hong must testify on Tuesday if Franco testifies on Tuesday.
  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing takes exactly three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Franco or Hong. Therefore, Garcia must testify on the remaining day, which is Monday or Wednesday. However, Hong does not testify on Monday, so Garcia must testify on Wednesday. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco and Hong must testify on Monday and Tuesday, but it is not specified which one testifies on which day. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Jackson must testify on Tuesday. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
- The hearing is three days long: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
- Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
- Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- Hong does not testify on Monday.
- At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must both testify on Tuesday, and Garcia must testify on Monday. Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, and Jackson can testify on either Monday or Wednesday. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - Three days of one week: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong cannot testify on Monday. Therefore, at least two witnesses testify on Monday. Garcia cannot testify on Monday, so Garcia must testify on Wednesday. Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, so Jackson must testify on Monday. That leaves Franco and Hong to testify on Tuesday. Therefore, the only option that must be true is:
Action: Answer("D") Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, we know that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Franco cannot testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Wednesday. This means that Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, so Iturbe must testify on Tuesday. This leaves Garcia to testify on Monday and Hong to testify on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("C") - Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Five witnesses (Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson) are scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday since Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco and Hong must both testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, we know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday. Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Garcia must testify on Monday and Jackson must testify on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday. This means that the witness who testifies on Monday must be either Garcia or Jackson. Since Hong does not testify on Monday, Hong must testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, and the only two witnesses left for Tuesday are Franco and Garcia. So, Garcia must testify on Tuesday with Franco. 

Action: Answer("C") - Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing takes exactly three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must both testify on either Tuesday or Wednesday. This means that Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday or Wednesday because Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Jackson must testify on Tuesday. This leaves Hong and Franco to testify on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing takes exactly three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must both testify on either Tuesday or Wednesday. 
  
  A: Franco cannot testify on Wednesday because Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday.
  C: Garcia cannot testify on Wednesday because Franco and Hong must both testify on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
  D: If Franco and Hong both testify on Tuesday, then this could be true.
  E: Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday, so this cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("D")

  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Thomson is on the team, then Paine must also be on the team. Therefore, Thomson and Paine is a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team. Similarly, if Wong is on the team, then Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. However, none of the other pairs of employees have any such constraints. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Thomson and Yoder.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis: 
  If Myers is on the team, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. Therefore, Ortega and Paine cannot be a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. Therefore, Paine and Thomson can be a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Therefore, Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees from among eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination:
  A: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Ortega cannot be on the team with Schmidt. So, Ortega and Schmidt cannot be a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  B: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Ortega cannot be on the team with Wong. So, Ortega and Wong cannot be a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  C: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Paine must be on the team with Schmidt. So, Paine and Schmidt can be a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  D: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Yoder must be on the team with Wong. So, Thomson and Yoder can be a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  E: None of these employees have any constraints on them being on the team together.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team together.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must be on the team together.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team together.
  Therefore, we can conclude that at least one of the pairs (Ortega and Wong), (Paine and Schmidt), (Thomson and Yoder) must be on the team.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:

  The team will include at least four employees from a total of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Process of elimination:
  A: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Ortega cannot be on the team with Schmidt. Eliminate A.
  B: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Ortega cannot be on the team with Wong. Eliminate B.
  C: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Paine cannot be on the team with Schmidt. Eliminate C.
  D: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Yoder must be on the team with Wong. Keep D.
  E: None of the employees in this pair have been mentioned in the constraints. Eliminate E.

  D: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Yoder and Thomson cannot be a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  E: None of these employees have any constraints that require them to be on the team.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees out of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

Analysis:
  To form a pair of employees, we need to find two employees who must be on the team together. 
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, if Ortega is on the team, Paine cannot be and vice versa. So, Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team together.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must be on the team together. So, Schmidt and Paine cannot be a pair of employees who must be on the team together.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team together. So, Wong and Yoder can be a pair of employees who must be on the team together.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a set of eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Therefore, if Myers is not on the team, then Wong cannot be on the team. This means that either Myers or Wong must be on the team. The only option that includes Wong is B: Ortega and Wong. Therefore, at least one of Ortega or Wong must be on the team.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees from the given eight employees.
  If Myers is selected, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  If Schmidt is selected, then both Paine and Thomson must be on the team.
  If Wong is selected, then both Myers and Yoder must be on the team.
  
Analysis:
  To form a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team, we need to look for employees who are not ruled out by any of the given constraints.
  Ortega and Paine are ruled out if Myers is selected.
  Schmidt is ruled out if Paine or Thomson is not selected.
  Wong is ruled out if Myers or Yoder is not selected.
  Thomson and Zayre are not ruled out by any of the given constraints.
  Therefore, the answer is either D or E.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find a pair of employees such that at least one of them must be on the team. 
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. This means that if Ortega is on the team, Myers cannot be on the team. 
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. This means that if Paine is not on the team, Schmidt cannot be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. This means that if Yoder is not on the team, Wong cannot be on the team.
  Therefore, the only pair of employees that must be on the team is Myers and Yoder.

Therefore, we can determine the sessions of 4 of the other lab assistants (Nessa, Kevin, Rebecca, and Lan). We cannot determine the sessions of Julio and Olivia. So, the answer is D: four.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are 6 lab sessions: 3 morning sessions and 3 afternoon sessions.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  Since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Lan's session must be on Wednesday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so Nessa's session must be on Thursday.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Kevin's and Rebecca's sessions must be on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the lab assistant for the Wednesday morning session is not determined.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: Wednesday AM, Wednesday PM, Thursday AM, Thursday PM, Friday AM, and Friday PM.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday. Also, Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning or Thursday morning. Therefore, we know the following:
  - Julio cannot lead the Wednesday morning, Thursday morning, or Friday afternoon session.
  - Olivia cannot lead the Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, or Friday morning session.
  - Nessa must lead the Wednesday afternoon or Thursday afternoon session.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday sessions or the Friday sessions.
  - Lan must lead the Wednesday morning or Friday morning session.
  
  We can now try to assign lab assistants to sessions based on the constraints:
  - Wednesday AM: Lan
  - Wednesday PM: Kevin/Rebecca
  - Thursday AM: 
      - If Nessa leads this session, then Olivia cannot lead any session. So, Nessa must lead the Thursday PM session and Olivia must lead the Friday PM session.
      - If Nessa leads the Wednesday PM session, then Olivia must lead the Thursday AM session and Nessa must lead the Thursday PM session.
  - Thursday PM: Nessa
  - Friday AM: Kevin/Rebecca
  - Friday PM: Olivia
  
  Based on this, we can determine the lab sessions for Lan, Nessa, Kevin/Rebecca, and Olivia. Therefore, we can determine the sessions for 4 lab assistants.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are six lab sessions: 3 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon, one for each day of Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Wednesday or Thursday.
  Nessa cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because Julio is already leading it.
  Therefore, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so Lan must lead a morning session and Olivia must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio must lead a morning session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Thursday.
  There are two remaining lab assistants, Lan and Nessa, who have not been assigned to a specific session.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day of Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then:
  1. Julio's session is on an earlier day than Friday, so Julio's session must be on either Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, or Thursday morning.
  2. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so Nessa's session must be on either Wednesday afternoon, Thursday afternoon, or Friday afternoon.
  3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so one of them must lead the remaining morning session on Friday.
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead the remaining morning and afternoon sessions on Wednesday or Thursday.
  
  Therefore, the only unknown assignments are for Lan and Olivia for the Wednesday morning and Thursday morning sessions, respectively.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one session per day.

  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach:
  1. We know that Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  2. We can use constraint 6 to determine that Olivia's session is on Friday afternoon.
  3. We can use constraint 5 to determine that Nessa leads the Friday afternoon session.
  4. We can use constraint 3 to determine that Nessa cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session, which means that Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Thursday sessions.
  5. We can use constraint 4 to determine that Lan and Olivia lead the Wednesday sessions.
  6. We can use constraint 2 to determine that Julio and Nessa cannot lead the same session.
  
Action: Answer("D")

  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  There are two morning and two afternoon sessions each day.
  
Analysis:
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session. 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead Wednesday or Thursday morning sessions.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Lan must lead either Wednesday or Thursday morning session, and Olivia must lead either Thursday or Friday afternoon session.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Therefore, Nessa must lead either Wednesday or Thursday afternoon session.
  
  The possible assignments of lab assistants to sessions are:
  Wednesday morning: Lan, Nessa, Julio/Rebecca/Kevin, Olivia
  Wednesday afternoon: Julio/Rebecca/Kevin, Olivia, Nessa, Lan
  Thursday morning: Olivia, Lan, Nessa, Julio/Rebecca/Kevin
  Thursday afternoon: Nessa, Julio/Rebecca/Kevin, Olivia, Lan
  Friday morning: Julio/Rebecca/Kevin, Nessa, Olivia, Lan
  Friday afternoon: Rebecca/Kevin, Nessa, Lan, Julio/Olivia
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the assignments of the following lab assistants:
  - Lan: Lan must lead Wednesday morning session.
  - Nessa: Nessa must lead Thursday afternoon session.
  - Olivia: Olivia must lead Friday afternoon session.
  - Kevin and Rebecca: They must lead Wednesday or Thursday morning sessions, but we cannot determine which one leads which session.
  
  Therefore, we can determine the assignments of 4 lab assistants.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina
  C: Irving and Robert
  D: Kyle and Nina
  E: Olivia and Kyle
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. George can give a report only on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  5. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  
Using the given conditions, we can make the following deductions:
  1. George must give his report on Tuesday, which means that there will be one report in the morning and one in the afternoon on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, which means that they both must give their reports in the morning.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then there are no restrictions on who gives reports on the next day.
  4. Since exactly six students will give reports, and we know that George, Olivia, and Robert will give their reports on Monday and Tuesday, then the remaining three students (Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, and Nina) must give their reports on Tuesday and Wednesday.
  
Using the deductions above, we can eliminate some of the answer choices:
  - A: George and Lenore: George must give his report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Wednesday with Lenore.
  - C: Irving and Robert: Robert must give his report on Monday or Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Wednesday with Irving.
  - E: Olivia and Kyle: Olivia must give her report on Monday or Tuesday, so she cannot give a report on Wednesday with Kyle.
  
This leaves us with two answer choices:
  - B: Helen and Nina
  - D: Kyle and Nina
  
If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. This means that Helen cannot give her report on Wednesday with Nina. Therefore, the only possible pair is Kyle and Nina, who must give their reports on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  1. George will give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. So, they will give their reports in the morning.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. So, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  4. So, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then the other report on Monday will be given by either Kyle or Lenore. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then the other report on Tuesday will be given by either Kyle or Lenore. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then the other report on Wednesday will be given by either Kyle or Lenore.
  5. So, if Kyle or Lenore gives a report on Monday, then the other one will give a report on Wednesday. If Kyle or Lenore gives a report on Tuesday, then the other one will give a report on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday are Kyle and Nina.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  We can use the information given to eliminate some choices and determine which pair of students must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot be part of the answer.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they cannot be part of the answer.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, leaving only Lenore and Kyle to give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot be part of the answer.
  - This leaves us with the pairs (Helen, Irving), (Kyle, Nina), and (Olivia, Kyle).
  - If Kyle gives a report on Monday, then Nina must give a report on Tuesday, which means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is (Helen, Irving).

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly six students will give oral reports during three consecutive days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Solution:
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, George cannot give a report on Tuesday, which contradicts the given condition. Hence, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, George cannot give a report on Wednesday, which contradicts the given condition. Hence, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, George can give a report on Tuesday. Hence, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  - We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, they must give reports in the morning. 
  - We also know that exactly two reports will be given each day. Therefore, George and Kyle must give reports in the morning on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. Lenore must give a report in the afternoon on Monday. Helen and Irving must give reports in the afternoon on Tuesday. Olivia and Robert must give reports in the morning on Wednesday.
  - Therefore, the only possible pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other is Helen and Nina.

  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But George can only give a report on Tuesday, so Nina cannot give a report on Monday. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday. If Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday, then Lenore and Kyle must give reports on Monday. That leaves Olivia and Robert to give reports on Wednesday. Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, one of them must give a morning report and the other must give an afternoon report. Therefore, Olivia and Robert cannot give reports on the same day. 
  A: There is no restriction between George and Lenore, so they can give reports on any day. 
  B: If Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, then Irving must also give a report on that day. But Irving cannot give a report on Monday, so Helen and Nina cannot give reports on Monday. If Helen and Nina give reports on Tuesday, then Lenore and Kyle must give reports on Monday. That leaves Olivia and Robert to give reports on Wednesday. Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, one of them must give a morning report and the other must give an afternoon report. Therefore, Olivia and Robert cannot give reports on the same day. 
  C: If Irving and Robert give reports on the same day, then Helen must also give a report on that day. But Helen cannot give a report on Monday, so Irving and Robert cannot give reports on Monday. If Irving and Robert give reports on Tuesday, then Helen and Nina must give reports on Wednesday. That leaves Lenore and Kyle to give reports on Monday. Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, George and Lenore cannot give reports on the same day. Therefore, Irving and Robert cannot give reports on the same day. 
  D: If Kyle and Nina give reports on the same day, then Helen must also give a report on that day. But Helen cannot give a report on Monday, so Kyle and Nina cannot give reports on Monday. If Kyle and Nina give reports on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. That leaves George and Lenore to give reports on Monday. Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, one of them must give a morning report and the other must give an afternoon report. Therefore, Olivia and Robert cannot give reports on the same day. 
  E: If Olivia and Kyle give reports on the same day, then Helen must also give a report on that day. But Helen cannot give a report on Monday, so Olivia and Kyle cannot give reports on Monday. If Olivia and Kyle give reports on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. That leaves George and Lenore to give reports on Monday. Since neither Robert nor Olivia can give an afternoon report, one of them must give a morning report and the other must give an afternoon report. Therefore, Olivia and Kyle cannot give reports on the same day.

Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  From condition 3, we know that George must give his report on Tuesday. 
  From condition 4, we know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. So, they both must give their reports in the morning.
  From condition 5, we know that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. So, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, otherwise, Helen and Irving both must give reports on Wednesday.
  Therefore, Nina must give her report on Monday or Wednesday.
  Let's consider each option:
  A: George and Lenore - George must give his report on Tuesday, so Lenore cannot give her report on Tuesday. Therefore, they cannot give reports on the same day.
  B: Helen and Nina - If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving both must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Helen and Nina cannot give reports on the same day. If Nina gives her report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving both cannot give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Helen and Nina cannot give reports on the same day.
  C: Irving and Robert - Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so he must give his report in the morning. If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Irving and Helen both must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Irving and Robert cannot give reports on the same day. If Nina gives her report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving both cannot give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Irving and Robert cannot give reports on the same day.
  D: Kyle and Nina - If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving both must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Kyle and Nina cannot give reports on the same day. If Nina gives her report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving both cannot give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Kyle and Nina cannot give reports on the same day.
  E: Olivia and Kyle - Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so she must give her report in the morning. If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving both must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Olivia and Kyle cannot give reports on the same day. If Nina gives her report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving both cannot give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Olivia and Kyle cannot give reports on the same day.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a table to keep track of which students can give reports on which days and at which times. 

| Day/Time | Morning | Afternoon |
| -------- | ------- | --------- |
| Monday   |         |           |
| Tuesday  | George  |           |
| Wednesday|         |           |

We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Therefore, we can deduce that on Wednesday, two students who have not given reports yet will have to give reports. 

If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday. 

If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday. 

Using the given conditions, we can update the table to reflect this information. 

| Day/Time | Morning         | Afternoon         |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Monday   |                 |                   |
| Tuesday  | George          |                   |
| Wednesday| Nina            |                   |
 
We can now determine which pairs of students must give reports on Wednesday. 
- George cannot give a report on Wednesday. 
- Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so they cannot give reports on Wednesday. 
- If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Wednesday. 
- Kyle has not been assigned a day to give a report yet. 

Therefore, the only possible pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are Helen and Irving. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can make the following deductions:
  1. George must give his report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert must give their reports in the morning.
  3. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday.
  4. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then no one else can give a report on Tuesday.
  5. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then no one else can give a report on Wednesday.

Now, we can try to pair each student with the possible days they can give their reports:
  Monday: (1)____, (2)____
  Tuesday: (1)George, (2)____
  Wednesday: (1)____, (2)____

We know that George must give his report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Therefore, we can fill in the following:
  Monday: (1)____, (2)Nina
  Tuesday: (1)George, (2)Olivia or Robert
  Wednesday: (1)____, (2)Helen and Irving or Kyle and Lenore

If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. Therefore, the only possible pair for Wednesday is Kyle and Lenore. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then no one else can give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, the only possible pair for Wednesday is Helen and Irving. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then no one else can give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, the only possible pair for Wednesday is Kyle and Lenore.

So, the answer is:
Action: Answer("B") Helen and Nina
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a chart to keep track of which students can give reports on which days:

| Day       | Morning   | Afternoon |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Monday    |           |           |
| Tuesday   | George    |           |
| Wednesday |           |           |

We know that Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports. Thus, we can update our chart:

| Day       | Morning      | Afternoon |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Monday    | Olivia       | Robert    |
| Tuesday   | George       |           |
| Wednesday |              |           |

If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, we can update our chart again:

| Day       | Morning      | Afternoon |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Monday    | Olivia       | Robert    |
| Tuesday   | George       |           |
| Wednesday | Nina         |           |
| Thursday  | Helen, Irving|           |

Now, we can determine which pairs of students must give reports on Wednesday. The only pair that can give a report on Wednesday is Helen and Irving. Therefore, the answer is:

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are four lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Each art historian gives one lecture on a different topic.
  The lectures are given one at a time.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures must be oil paintings, watercolors, sculptures, and lithographs.
  
Analysis:
  A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. This violates the given constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the watercolors lecture. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. This violates the given constraint that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture. This violates the given constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must be later than the sculptures lecture. This means that Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must be the last two lectures, and they must be on the topics of oil paintings and lithographs, in some order. This is consistent with the given constraints, so D could be true.
  E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. This violates the given constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the watercolors lecture. Therefore, E is not true.

Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures.
- Each historian will give a lecture on a different topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
- The lectures will be given one at a time.
- Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
- Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
- The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.

Action: Answer("E")
If the watercolors lecture is third, then the oil paintings lecture must be first or second, and the lithographs lecture must be last. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley's lecture must be first. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so Holden's lecture must be second. Therefore, Garcia and Jiang will give the lectures on oil paintings and sculptures, but we don't know which one will give which lecture. The only option that fits this scenario is E, where Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.

    - 2. Oil paintings  1. Lithographs  3. Watercolors  4. Sculptures
Choices:
  A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then Farley's lecture must be first or second. This violates the constraint that the watercolors lecture is third. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then the order of the lectures is: 1. Lithographs  2. Watercolors  3. Oil paintings  4. Sculptures. This order satisfies all the constraints, so B could be true.
  C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the order of the lectures is: 1. Lithographs  2. Oil paintings  3. Watercolors  4. Sculptures. This violates the constraint that the watercolors lecture is third. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then the order of the lectures is either: 
    - 1. Lithographs  2. Oil paintings  3. Watercolors  4. Sculptures
    - 2. Oil paintings  1. Lithographs  3. Watercolors  4. Sculptures
    Both orders satisfy all the constraints, so D could be true.
  E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the order of the lectures is: 1. Watercolors  2. Oil paintings  3. Lithographs  4. Sculptures. This violates the constraint that the watercolors lecture is third. Therefore, E is not true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:

  Choice E: This is a valid assignment. Frost and Heideck are assigned together to one ceremony, and Gonzalez, Knutson, and Lai are assigned to the other ceremony, satisfying the constraint that if Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Mays is also assigned to the second ceremony, satisfying the constraint that if Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The manager must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Solution:
  Option A: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, but they are not assigned together in this option. Incorrect.
  Option B: Knutson is assigned to Thorne University, but Heideck and Mays are not assigned to it. Incorrect.
  Option C: This option satisfies all the given constraints. Frost and Heideck are assigned together to Silva University, Lai is assigned to Thorne University because Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University, and Knutson is assigned to Thorne University because he is not assigned to Silva University. Correct.
  Option D: Frost, Heideck, and Mays are assigned to Silva University, but Gonzalez and Lai cannot be assigned to Thorne University together. Incorrect.
  Option E: Frost, Heideck, and Mays are assigned to Silva University, but Gonzalez and Knutson cannot be assigned to Thorne University together. Incorrect.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and one chemist. Also, since P is the only zoologist, we know that none of Q and R can be selected. Therefore, the panel must include two botanists and two chemists.
  
  A: If K is selected, then M cannot be selected. There must be at least two chemists in the panel, so G must be selected. Therefore, F cannot be selected. This statement is true.
  B: If L is selected, then M must be selected. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. This statement is false.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. This statement is false. We need at least two chemists in the panel and K cannot be selected alone.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then F must be selected. This statement is false. We need at least two botanists in the panel and if two chemists are selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then F must be selected. This statement is false. We need at least two botanists in the panel and if two chemists are selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Action: Answer("B")

If P is the only zoologist selected, then we know that there must be at least one botanist and one chemist selected. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, we know that only one botanist can be selected. If M is not selected, then neither P nor R can be selected. Therefore, we know that M must be selected, and both P and R must be selected. This means that the panel consists of F, L, and M (chemists), and P (zoologist). Since F and K cannot both be selected, we know that F cannot be selected if L is selected. Therefore, if L is selected, F cannot be selected. Thus, the correct answer is B.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist and either K or L must be selected as a chemist. Also, since more than one botanist cannot be selected if P is the only zoologist selected, H cannot be selected. Since K and M cannot both be selected, and if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, then M cannot be selected. Therefore, L must be selected as the chemist. 

Analysis:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. - There is no direct relationship between K and G.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. - There is no direct relationship between L and F.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. - This is not necessarily true since L is the only chemist selected in this scenario.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true since only one botanist can be selected in this scenario and it could be F.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true since only one botanist can be selected in this scenario and it could be G.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, and G is selected, then we cannot select either F or H, which violates the condition of having at least one botanist in the panel. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  B: If L is selected, then we cannot select K and M, which means we cannot select either F or G, violating the condition of having at least one botanist in the panel. Therefore, this statement must be true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it could be any of K, L, or M. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, they could be any two of K, L, and M. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, and one of them is K, then we cannot select G, which violates the condition of having at least one botanist in the panel. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: 
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected. If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which would be a violation of the second condition. Therefore, G must be selected. If L is selected, then K and M cannot both be selected, which means that F must be selected. This violates the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. Therefore, F cannot be selected if L is selected. So, if L is selected, F cannot be selected. Thus, the correct answer is B.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist. If G is selected, then K must not be selected. If F is selected, then K may or may not be selected. If K is selected, then G cannot be selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true. If F is selected, then K can be selected and G can also be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true. If K is not selected, then both F and L can be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. This is not necessarily true. If K is not selected, then either L or M can be selected.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true. If K is not selected, then both L and M can be selected along with F.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. This is true. If exactly two chemists are selected, then either K and L or L and M are selected. If K and L are selected, then G cannot be selected because more than one botanist is selected. If L and M are selected, then G can be selected as the botanist.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - If K is selected, then P and either F or G must be selected. If F is selected, then Q or R must be selected, but not both. If G is selected, then both Q and R must be selected. Therefore, A is not necessarily true.
  - If L is selected, then at least one botanist and one zoologist must be selected. If F is selected, then Q or R must be selected, but not both. If G is selected, then either Q or R must be selected, but not both. Therefore, B is not necessarily true.
  - If exactly one chemist is selected, then it must be either L or M. If L is selected, then at least one botanist and one zoologist must be selected. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected, and either F or G must be selected. Therefore, C is not necessarily true.
  - If exactly two chemists are selected, then neither K nor M can be selected. Therefore, D is true.
  - If exactly two chemists are selected, then neither K nor M can be selected. Therefore, E is true.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist. Also, since only one zoologist can be selected, there must be at least two chemists selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, then M cannot be selected. This means that P and R cannot be selected, and therefore, the panel cannot include at least one scientist of each of the three types. This statement is false.
  B: If L is selected, then K and M must be selected. This means that F and G must be selected as botanists, and since only one zoologist can be selected, P cannot be selected. This statement is false.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be L or M. However, if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected, which is not possible since only one zoologist can be selected. Therefore, L must be selected as the only chemist, and this statement is true.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then they must be L and M. This means that F and G must be selected as botanists, and since only one zoologist can be selected, P cannot be selected. This statement is false.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then they must be L and M. This means that F and G must be selected as botanists, and since only one zoologist can be selected, P cannot be selected. This statement is also false.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F, G, or H must be selected as a botanist, and either K, L, or M must be selected as a chemist. If M is not selected, then neither P nor R can be selected. If K is selected, then F and H are the only remaining botanists, and at most one of them can be selected. 
  A: If K is selected, then either F or H must be selected. Therefore, G can still be selected.
  B: If L is selected, then either K or M must be selected as a chemist. Therefore, F can still be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it could be L or M. Therefore, it does not have to be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then they could be any two of the three chemists (K, L, or M). Therefore, F could still be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then they could be any two of the three chemists (K, L, or M). Therefore, G could still be selected.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and either K, L, or M must be selected as a chemist.
  
  A: If K is selected, and G is not selected, then this satisfies the conditions of the problem, so this statement could be true, but it does not have to be true.
  B: If L is selected, then either K or M must be selected as the chemist, and neither of them can be selected with F and G. Therefore, this statement is true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it could be any of the three chemists, so this statement is not necessarily true.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then either K and L, K and M, or L and M must be selected. If K and L are selected, then F and G must be the botanists, but this violates the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. If K and M are selected, then P and R must also be selected, but this violates the condition that K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, if exactly two chemists are selected, neither F nor K can be selected, so this statement is true.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then either K and L, K and M, or L and M must be selected. If K and L are selected, then F and G must be the botanists, but this violates the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. If K and M are selected, then P and R must also be selected, but this violates the condition that K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, if exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected, so this statement is true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

To determine the answer, we need to find the options that are not compatible with Quinn being in the same sales zone.

If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Parra must also be in Zone 1. But this would mean that Tiao is in Zone 2, which would force Udall to be in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Mahr would also be in Zone 3, which would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot be in Zone 1.

If Quinn is in Zone 2, then Tiao must also be in Zone 2. But this would mean that Udall is in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Mahr would also be in Zone 3, which would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot be in Zone 2.

If Quinn is in Zone 3, then Stuckey and Udall would also be in Zone 3, which would satisfy the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn can be in Zone 3.

Option A: Kim is not incompatible with Quinn being in the same sales zone.
Option B: Mahr is not incompatible with Quinn being in the same sales zone.
Option C: Stuckey is incompatible with Quinn being in the same sales zone, but we know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so Quinn and Stuckey must be in the same sales zone.
Option D: Tiao is not incompatible with Quinn being in the same sales zone.
Option E: Udall is not incompatible with Quinn being in the same sales zone.

Therefore, the answer is C: Stuckey.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, then there would be at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, and at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2 (since Tiao and Udall cannot both work in the same zone). This would mean that there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, which would contradict the statement that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  
  A: There is no information about whether Kim can work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  B: There is no information about whether Mahr can work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  C: Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so Quinn could work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  D: If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Tiao, then Parra would have to work in Zone 1, and Udall would have to work in Zone 2. This would mean that there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1 and at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, which would contradict the statement that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  E: Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so Quinn could work in the same sales zone as Udall.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  Since Parra and Quinn must work in the same sales zone, and either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, it follows that Tiao must work in Zone 2. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that there are 4 sales representatives in Zone 3, and only 2 in Zone 2. Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, and there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, it follows that neither Stuckey nor Udall can work in Zone 2. Therefore, Stuckey must work in Zone 3, along with Kim, Mahr, and either Parra or Tiao. This means that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, so the answer is C: Stuckey.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, then Quinn cannot work in Zone 1. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then Quinn cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn must work in Zone 3, which means that Stuckey and Udall must also work in Zone 3. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn works in a zone with Parra, then there would be three sales representatives in that zone. This is not possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  
  A: Kim is not mentioned in relation to Quinn, so it is not relevant to the question.
  B: Mahr is not mentioned in relation to Quinn, so it is not relevant to the question.
  C: Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall, so it is not possible for Quinn to work in the same sales zone as both Stuckey and Udall. However, we have already determined that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra, so the answer is still Parra.
  D: Tiao is mentioned in relation to Parra, but not Quinn. Therefore, it is not relevant to the question.
  E: Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, so it is not possible for Quinn to work in the same sales zone as both Udall and Stuckey. However, we have already determined that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra, so the answer is still Parra.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Parra or Tiao (not both) works in Zone 1.
  Tiao or Udall (not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
To determine the answer, we need to find the possible zones where Quinn can work and eliminate the zone in which the given representative works.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and Quinn works in the same zone as Parra, which means that Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3. In this case, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao, so the answer is D.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 2 and Quinn works in the same zone as Parra, which means that Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3. In this case, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao, so the answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
To determine the answer, we need to find which sales representative(s) Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, then Quinn cannot work in Zone 1 with Tiao. Also, since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then Quinn cannot work in Zone 2 with Tiao or Udall. Therefore, the answer is either B or D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn, which means that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  We need to find the sales representative who cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 1, which means Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Udall must work in Zone 3. This would mean that Stuckey and Mahr would have to work in Zone 3, which is not possible since there are more people in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, which means Parra must work in Zone 3, and Udall must work in Zone 2. This would mean that Stuckey and Mahr would have to work in Zone 3, which is not possible since there are more people in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So Quinn cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then Stuckey and Udall must also work in Zone 3. This means that Parra and Tiao would have to work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, but we don't know who would work in which zone. However, we do know that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, so the answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")

  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3, which would mean that Tiao and Udall both work in Zone 2, which is not allowed. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session?
Choices:
  A: Julio, Nessa
  B: Kevin, Rebecca
  C: Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  E: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Rebecca
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - There are six lab assistants in total: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are six lab sessions in total: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Friday morning. Lan cannot lead a session on Wednesday or Thursday, so she must lead a session on Friday morning. 
  
  The possible candidates for leading the Thursday afternoon session are Julio, Kevin, and Rebecca. Olivia cannot lead the session because she is leading a session on Friday morning, which is later in the week than Thursday afternoon. Nessa cannot lead the session because she must lead an afternoon session and her session is on Friday afternoon.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  6. There are six lab sessions: Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.
  
  We know that Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's. Therefore, Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. 
  According to the constraints, Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Lan and Olivia must lead the Wednesday morning and Thursday morning sessions, but it is not clear which one leads which session. 
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning or Thursday morning, and Olivia's session must be on Thursday morning or Friday morning. Again, it is not clear which one leads which session. 
  That leaves Kevin and Rebecca to lead the Wednesday afternoon and Friday afternoon sessions, but it is not clear which one leads which session.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
  Since we know that Kevin's session is on Thursday afternoon and Nessa must lead an afternoon session, we can conclude that Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon. Therefore, Julio, Kevin, Lan, Olivia, and Rebecca are all available to lead the Thursday afternoon session. However, we know that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so only Julio and Nessa are available to lead the Thursday afternoon session. Therefore, the answer is A: Julio, Nessa.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5. There are six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session being held each morning and one each afternoon.
  
  From the given information, we know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then we can deduce that Kevin and Rebecca's session must be on Wednesday, and Nessa's session must be on Thursday afternoon. Therefore, Julio and Olivia's sessions must be on Friday.
  
  Now, we need to find the lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session. From the given information, we know that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, but we don't know which day. Therefore, Nessa could lead the Thursday afternoon session. Also, Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because they must lead sessions on Wednesday. Lan and Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because their sessions must be on Friday. Therefore, the lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio and Nessa.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are six lab sessions: Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Thursday. Also, since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, and Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon, then Lan and Olivia must lead sessions on Wednesday and Thursday. Finally, Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Friday morning. Therefore, the lab assistants available for Thursday afternoon are Kevin, Rebecca, and Nessa.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  We need to find a list of lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session.
Analysis:
  Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session and her session is on Friday, Kevin's session must meet on Thursday afternoon. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, and Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon, neither Lan nor Olivia can lead the Thursday afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session cannot be on Friday afternoon. Therefore, Julio, Kevin, and Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. This leaves Nessa as the only lab assistant who could lead the Thursday afternoon session.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5. There are six lab assistants in total.
  6. There are two lab sessions per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  7. There are three lab session days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  
  We are given that Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's. If Kevin's session is on Thursday, then Nessa's session must be on Friday. Therefore, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session. We also know that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so neither of them can lead the Thursday afternoon session. That leaves us with four lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session: Julio, Kevin, Rebecca, and Nessa.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  There are six lab assistants in total.
  There are six lab sessions in total.
  Each session will be led by a different lab assistant.
  There is one session each morning and one each afternoon on each day.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then the sessions on Wednesday are Kevin's and Rebecca's, and the session on Thursday afternoon is Nessa's.
  
  A: Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Therefore, A is not a complete and accurate list of lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  B: Kevin has to lead a session on Wednesday, so he cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Therefore, B is not a complete and accurate list of lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  C: This is a possible list of lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, C is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session.

  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Thursday is the day for Nessa's session.
  We need to find the lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  
Analysis:
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Thursday is the day for Nessa's session. So, Nessa must lead the Thursday afternoon session. 
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. So, Julio's session must be on Wednesday and Olivia's session must be on Thursday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. So, Lan's session must be on Wednesday or Friday.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. So, Kevin's session and Rebecca's session must be on either Wednesday or Thursday.
  
  From the above analysis, we can conclude that:
  - Wednesday morning session can be led by Julio or Olivia.
  - Wednesday afternoon session can be led by Lan or Rebecca.
  - Thursday morning session can be led by Julio or Olivia.
  - Thursday afternoon session must be led by Nessa.
  - Friday morning session can be led by Julio or Olivia.

Action: 
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. 
  Therefore, Rebecca's session must also be on Thursday afternoon since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Friday morning.
  Lan cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session, so the lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio, Kevin, Nessa, and Rebecca.
  Answer("C")
Response 9:

Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, which one of the following is the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—will fill six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - We need to determine the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform, given that Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  
Analysis:
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3 and Zircon must perform in slot 2.
  - Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot 1 or slot 2.
  - However, Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Wellspring cannot perform in slot 1.
  - Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 2.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will perform in six different slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - We need to determine the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.

Solution:
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign performs in either slot 2 or slot 3.
  - If Yardsign performs in slot 2, then Wellspring can perform in slot 1, which contradicts the given constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot 3.
  - Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Yardsign performs in slot 3, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 2.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Six slots are numbered one through six.
  - Six bands are performing: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Each band will perform in just one slot.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon must perform in slot 1 or slot 2. 
  If Zircon performs in slot 1, then Wellspring must perform in slot 2 or slot 3. 
  If Zircon performs in slot 2, then Wellspring must perform in slot 3. 
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot three.
Response 3:

  - There are six slots numbered one through six.
  - Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—will perform in just one slot each.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3. This means that Uneasy must perform in one of the last two slots (slots 5 or 6). This also means that Wellspring must perform in slot 4, since both Wellspring and Zircon perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will perform in six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - We need to find the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  
Process: 
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign cannot perform in the first three slots. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot 4, 5, or 6.
  - Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, Xpert must perform in slot 6. Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot 4 or 5.
  - If Uneasy performs in slot 4, then Wellspring must perform in slot 2, which is the earliest slot it can perform in.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will fill six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - We need to determine the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  
Analysis:
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then we have two possible scenarios:
    1. Zircon performs in slot 2 and Yardsign performs in slot 3.
    2. Zircon performs in slot 1 and Yardsign performs in slot 2.
  - In both scenarios, we know that Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, Wellspring cannot perform in slot 6.
  - Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, then Wellspring cannot perform in slot 4 or 5.
  - Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, then Wellspring cannot perform in slot 1 or 2.
  - Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 3.

    2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot three.
  - Therefore, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and two in some order.
  - Xpert must perform in slot three, and Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
  - Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot two, and the earliest slot in which it could perform is slot four.

  5. Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  
  If Yardsign performs in slot 1, then Zircon must perform in slot 2, and Wellspring must perform in slot 3. If Yardsign performs in slot 2, then Zircon must perform in slot 1, and Wellspring must perform in slot 3. If Yardsign performs in slot 3, then Zircon must perform in slot 1 or 2, and Wellspring must perform in slot 2 or 3. If Yardsign performs in slot 4, then Zircon must perform in slot 1 or 2, and Wellspring must perform in slot 2, 3, or 4. If Yardsign performs in slot 5, then Zircon must perform in slot 1, 2, or 3, and Wellspring must perform in slot 3, 4, or 5. If Yardsign performs in slot 6, then Zircon must perform in slot 1, 2, or 3, and Wellspring must perform in slot 4, 5, or 6.

Action: Answer("B") 
If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 2 or 3. If Yardsign performs in slot 2, then Zircon must perform in slot 1, and Wellspring must perform in slot 3. Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 3.
Response 8:

  - There are six slots, numbered one through six.
  - Six bands will perform, each in a different slot.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign:
  - Yardsign cannot perform in slot one.
  - Wellspring cannot perform in slot six.
  - Zircon cannot perform in slot six.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in either slot one, slot two, or slot three. Therefore, Wellspring must perform in either slot four or slot five. The earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot four.
Response 9:

  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) are going to perform in six slots numbered one to six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - We need to find the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.

Analysis:
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3 because Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot 4 or later because Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Yardsign performs in slot 3, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots 1 and 2 in some order, and Xpert must perform in slot 5 or later.
  - If Wellspring performs in slot 2, then Zircon must perform in slot 1, which contradicts the fact that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Therefore, if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 3.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices must be: Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, and Stanton. 

  Stanton cannot have been recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, Stanton must have been recruited either first, second, fifth, or seventh.
  
Analysis:
  Since Stanton cannot have been recruited first, fifth, or seventh, the only remaining option is second.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices would be: 
  Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, Stanton
  
  Stanton cannot be recruited first because the detective has established that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, and Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited before Peters.
  
  Stanton cannot be recruited second because if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn cannot be second, and the detective has established that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time. Therefore, Stanton cannot be second.
  
  Stanton cannot be recruited third because if Villas was recruited immediately before White, then Villas cannot be third, and the detective has established that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time. Therefore, Stanton cannot be third.
  
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of the accomplices would be:
  Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Stanton, Rovero, Tao
  
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order of the accomplices would be:
  Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, Stanton
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited fifth.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment must be: Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, and Stanton.
  
  Stanton cannot be recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited fifth or seventh.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment must be: Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), Villas, White, Stanton or Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), White, Villas, Stanton.

If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of recruitment must be: Stanton, (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown). But this is not possible since the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time. 

If Stanton was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be: (unknown), Stanton, (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown). But this is not possible since the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of recruitment must be: (unknown), (unknown), Stanton, (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown). This is possible since the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment must be: (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), Stanton, (unknown), (unknown). This is also possible since the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order of recruitment must be: (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), (unknown), Stanton. But this is not possible since the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited third (choice C).

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices would be:
  Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, Stanton
  
  Therefore, Stanton could not have been recruited fifth or seventh because he was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited fifth or Rovero must have been recruited third.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Villas, White, Tao, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton. In this case, Stanton would have been recruited seventh, so the statement would be true.
  If Rovero was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Quinn, Tao, Stanton. In this case, Stanton would have been recruited sixth, so the statement would be false.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices must be: Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, Stanton.

In this scenario, Stanton was recruited fifth, which means he cannot have been recruited after Tao (who was recruited sixth) but before Rovero (who was recruited seventh).

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices would be: [Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, Stanton]
  
  Therefore, Stanton must have been recruited either third, fifth, or seventh.
  
Action: Answer("A") - first.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment must be: [1, 2, Quinn, Rovero, 5, Villas, White] or [1, 2, Rovero, Quinn, 5, Villas, White].
  Stanton cannot have been recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment must be: [1, 2, Quinn, Rovero, 5, Villas, White] or [1, 2, Rovero, Quinn, 5, Villas, White]. 
  In either case, Stanton must have been recruited either third or fifth. Therefore, Stanton cannot have been recruited in the fifth position.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be as follows:
  Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be as follows:
  Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  Stanton was recruited third in this order. Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited third.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band, each performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, we can infer that the saxophonist performs the solo after the trumpeter does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform before the trumpeter. So, the percussionist must perform before the fourth solo, which means that the percussionist performs either the first or the second solo. Hence, the correct answer is D.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member of the band performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then we know that the saxophonist must perform a solo at some time after the trumpeter does. Therefore, the percussionist performs a solo before the trumpeter does. This means that option D, "The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does," must be true.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Each member of the six-member band performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the first solo, and the percussionist cannot perform the last solo. Since the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, the guitarist must perform the last solo. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform the second solo, and the violinist must perform the third solo. This means that the percussionist must perform the first solo, and the trumpeter must perform the fifth solo. Thus, the correct answer is D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band and each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Solution:
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the trumpeter does. 
  Since the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, the guitarist must perform the sixth solo. 
  Therefore, the keyboard player must perform the fifth solo. 
  The violinist must perform a solo before the keyboard player does. 
  So, the violinist must perform the third solo. 
  Therefore, the percussionist must perform the first solo and the trumpeter must perform the second solo. 
  So, the only option that must be true is D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band, each performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, it means that the saxophonist must perform the solo after the trumpeter does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform the solo before the trumpeter does. So, the correct answer is D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 members in the band, and each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, it means that the saxophonist should perform a solo after the percussionist. According to the given restrictions, the trumpeter also performs before the saxophonist. Therefore, the percussionist performs a solo before the trumpeter does. Hence, the correct answer is D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band and each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Analysis:
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does. 
  The saxophonist cannot perform the first solo because the percussionist performs before the saxophonist. 
  The percussionist cannot perform the last solo because the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. 
  The percussionist cannot perform the third solo because the keyboard player performs a solo at some time before the guitarist does, and the violinist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. 
  Therefore, the percussionist must perform the second solo. 
  The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does because the saxophonist cannot perform the first solo, and the percussionist performs the second solo. 
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does because the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. 
  The saxophonist cannot perform a solo before the keyboard player does because the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

To consider:
  - If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, what must be true?

Analysis:
  - If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist, then the saxophonist must perform at least after the percussionist.
  - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so the keyboard player must perform after the saxophonist.
  - The keyboard player performs before the guitarist, so the guitarist must perform after the saxophonist.
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform his solo after the trumpeter does, but not necessarily after the percussionist. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B. 
  
  The fact that the violinist performs before the keyboard player means that the violinist must perform either first or second. Therefore, choice C is not necessarily true. 
  
  Choice D is possible, but not necessarily true. 
  
  Choice E is not necessarily true because the saxophonist can perform his solo after the percussionist does.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band and each of them performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist does. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Since the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, the keyboard player cannot perform the first solo. Therefore, the percussionist must perform the first solo. The violinist performs before the keyboard player, so the violinist cannot perform the last solo. Therefore, the saxophonist performs the last solo. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform the third solo. Therefore, the keyboard player performs the second solo. This means that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does. Thus, the correct answer is D.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then we know that the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor, since no wall can have only oil paintings. We also know that the other painting on wall 2 cannot be by Franz or Isaacs, since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, the only possible options are Greene's watercolor and Hidalgo's watercolor. However, we know that no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, so Hidalgo's watercolor cannot also be on wall 2. Therefore, the answer is (B) Greene's watercolor.

Action: Answer("B")

  2. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then:
  1. Wall 2 has Hidalgo's oil.
  2. Wall 2 cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor, as no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. Wall 2 cannot have the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. Wall 2 cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so Franz's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  
  Therefore, the only option that could be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then:
  - Wall 2 has one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  - Wall 2 cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed in the upper position of wall 2.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  
  A: Franz's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2 because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  B: Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed in the upper position of wall 2 because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  C: Greene's oil could be displayed on wall 2 because it is not restricted by any of the given conditions.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because wall 2 already has Hidalgo's oil painting.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Franz and Isaacs cannot be displayed on the same wall.
  2. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  3. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  4. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Reasoning:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we know that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2. Also, we know that no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, so Hidalgo's other painting, which is a watercolor, must be displayed on a different wall. This means that Hidalgo cannot be displayed on any other wall. Therefore, neither Hidalgo's oil nor Hidalgo's watercolor can be displayed on any other wall. This means that the answer cannot be D. We also know that Franz and Isaacs cannot be displayed on the same wall, so the answer cannot be A or E. Therefore, the only possible answer is C, which is Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor, in the upper and lower positions.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Action: Answer("B")  

Explanation: 
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we know that wall 2 has an oil painting by Hidalgo and a watercolor painting by another student. We can eliminate choices A, C, D, and E because they all involve Hidalgo's watercolor or one of Franz's or Isaacs's paintings, which cannot be on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. That leaves us with choice B, which is Greene's watercolor. We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, and since Franz's oil cannot be on wall 2, it must be another student's oil painting in the upper position on wall 2, allowing Greene's watercolor to be in the lower position.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each of the four students has exactly one oil and one watercolor painting.
  2. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then neither Hidalgo's watercolor nor Isaacs's oil can be displayed on wall 2. Also, neither Franz's oil nor Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on wall 2 because both of these paintings cannot be displayed on the same wall. Therefore, the only option left is Greene's watercolor, which can be displayed in the lower position of wall 2. So, the answer is D: Hidalgo's watercolor.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor, in upper and lower positions.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
To determine which painting could be displayed on wall 2, we need to consider the conditions that must be satisfied. Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we know that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because no wall can have only one student's work displayed on it. 

The only way that wall 2 can have a watercolor painting is if it is paired with an oil painting by a different student. Since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, we know that neither Franz's oil nor Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on wall 2. 

According to the condition "Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed," we know that if Franz's oil is not on wall 2, then neither is Greene's watercolor. Therefore, the only option left is Greene's oil. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  According to the given conditions, we know that wall 2 has one oil painting and one watercolor painting. Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we know that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2. Also, no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, we know that one of the other students' paintings must be displayed on wall 2 in the watercolor medium. We also know that no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, the watercolor painting on wall 2 cannot be painted by Hidalgo, Franz, or Isaacs. We are left with Greene's watercolor and Greene's oil. According to the given conditions, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, Greene's watercolor could also be displayed on wall 2. Answer B is correct.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then:
  - Wall 2 has Hidalgo's oil.
  - Wall 2 cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor because no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - Wall 2 cannot have the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - Wall 2 cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it because no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Wall 2 cannot have Greene's watercolor because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Wall 2 can have either Franz's oil or Greene's oil.

Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel.
  B: Bay 4 is holding produce.
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles.
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain.
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then which one of the following could be true of this evening's schedule?
Choices:
  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then they cannot be shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film must be shown on screens 1 or 2.
  Since the western begins before the horror film, the western cannot be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1 or 2.
  Therefore, the western must be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1 or 2.
  If the western is shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1 or 2, then the sci-fi film must be shown at 9 P.M. on the same screen.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so neither of them can be shown on the same screen as the western and the sci-fi film.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 3.
  If the romance is shown on screen 1, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screen 2, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the romance must be shown on screen 3.
  If the romance is shown on screen 3, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screens 1 and 2, but it is not known which one is shown on which screen.
  Therefore, the mystery could begin at 9 P.M. on screen 2.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. The western begins before the horror film.
  2. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  3. The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  4. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  5. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.

Assuming that the western and sci-fi film are shown on screen 1 or 2, the horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 (because the romance is not shown on screen 2). Therefore, the horror film must be shown on screen 1. Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, the mystery must be shown on screen 2. Therefore, the western and sci-fi film must be shown on screen 1. 

This means that the western begins at 7 P.M. or 9 P.M. and the sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M. or 9 P.M. 

A: The horror film is shown on screen 2. - False, the horror film is shown on screen 1.
B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M. - True, the mystery is shown on screen 2 and begins at 9 P.M.
C: The romance is shown on screen 3. - False, the romance cannot be shown on screen 3.
D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M. - True, the sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M. or 9 P.M. and is shown on screen 1.
E: The western begins at 8 P.M. - False, the western begins at 7 P.M. or 9 P.M. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on different screens. Also, the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3. Therefore, the only possible screen for the western and the sci-fi film to be shown together is screen 1 or screen 2. If they are shown on screen 1, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screen 2, and the romance must be shown on screen 3. If they are shown on screen 2, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screen 1, and the romance must be shown on screen 3.
  
  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2. - This cannot be true because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M. - This could be true if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2, and the horror film is shown on screen 1.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3. - This could be true if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1, and the horror film is shown on screen 2.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M. - This cannot be true because the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M. - This cannot be true because the western must begin before the horror film.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - There are three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Action: 
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the romance cannot be shown on screen 2 because the romance is not shown on screen 2. Therefore, the romance must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3. However, the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so the romance must be shown on screen 1. Since screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screen 2. Therefore, the western must be shown on screen 3. This means that the western begins at 8 P.M. and the sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M. So, the answer is D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. The western begins before the horror film.
  2. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  3. The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  4. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  5. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.

Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only possibility is that they are both shown on screen 1 or screen 2, since the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. If they are both shown on screen 1 or screen 2, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on the other screen. Therefore, the romance cannot be shown on screen 2. So, the only possible option is that the romance is shown on screen 3.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  2. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  3. The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  4. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  5. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.

Analysis:
  Let's assume that the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1 or screen 2. In either case, the horror film cannot be shown on the same screen as the western, so it must be shown on the other screen. The mystery cannot be shown on the same screen as the horror film, so it must be shown on the third screen. The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on the remaining slot on screen 1. This leaves the sci-fi film to be shown on the remaining slot on screen 2. Therefore, the mystery must begin at 9 P.M. and the sci-fi film must begin at 7 P.M.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:

  A: The schedule does not specify where the horror film is shown, so it could be on screen 2. This choice is possible.
  B: The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the mystery cannot begin at 9 P.M. if the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen. This choice is not possible.
  C: The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it cannot be shown on screen 3 if the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen. This choice is not possible.
  D: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it cannot begin at 7 P.M. if the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen. This choice is not possible.
  E: The western begins before the horror film, so it cannot begin at 8 P.M. if the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen. This choice is not possible.

  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2. - This is not possible because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M. - This is possible because the mystery can be shown on screen 1 or 2 at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3. - This is not possible because the romance is not shown on screen 2, and screen 3 shows only one movie at 8 P.M.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M. - This is not possible because the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, and screens 1 and 2 show two movies each.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M. - This is possible because the western can be shown on screen 1 or 2 at 7 P.M. and the sci-fi film can be shown on the same screen at 9 P.M.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.

  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screens 1 and 2 in some order. The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 3. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2. The western must begin before the horror film, so it cannot begin at 8 P.M. Therefore, the only option that could be true is:
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 9:
Knowledge:

  5. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
Analysis:
  - If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must begin before the sci-fi film.
  - Since the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3, it must be shown on either screen 1 or 2.
  - Since the romance is not shown on screen 2, it must be shown on screen 1 if the sci-fi film is shown on screen 2.
  - Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, the horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 if the mystery is shown on screen 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on the same screen, and the western begins before the sci-fi film, then the only possible screen for them to be shown on is screen 1. Therefore, the sci-fi film must begin at 7 P.M. on screen 1. This means that the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1, so it must be shown on screen 2, which means the mystery must be shown on screen 3. This leaves the romance to be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that the sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M. (choice D).

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: Which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one?
Choices:
  A: Yardsign
  B: Vegemite, Wellspring
  C: Vegemite, Yardsign
  D: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign
  E: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign, Zircon
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The bands are Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - We are looking for a list of bands that can perform in slot one.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, it can't be the band that performs in slot one.
  - From the given constraints, we know that Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, any list that includes Xpert cannot be the answer.
  - From the above two points, we can conclude that the answer must include Vegemite and/or Wellspring.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it can't be the band that performs in slot one.
  
Solution:
  - The only options left are Vegemite and Wellspring.
  - The answer must include at least one of them.
  - The only option that includes both of them is D: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The order of the six bands must meet the following constraints:
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  We are looking for a list of bands that could perform in slot one, so we need to find the bands that satisfy the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
Analysis:
  - Yardsign must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  - According to the constraints, Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Wellspring and Zircon must each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
  
  We can create a list of bands that could perform in slot one by selecting the bands that satisfy the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. Since Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, it could be the band that performs in slot one. Vegemite and Wellspring could perform in slot two or three, and Uneasy, Xpert, and Zircon could perform in slots four, five, or six.

  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
Analysis:
  Slot one is one of the first three slots, so Yardsign must perform in slot one. 
  From the given constraints, Vegemite and Wellspring could perform in slot two because they perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. 
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of bands that could perform in slot one is Yardsign, Vegemite, and Wellspring.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Action: Answer("E") 

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the top or middle shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the top shelf. Therefore, O must be on the middle shelf and K must be on the top shelf. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, F must be on the bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, M must also be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, G and H must be on the same shelf as each other, and the only remaining pair of books is I and G, which must be on the top shelf. Thus, the answer is E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the top or middle shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the middle shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and F and M must be on the bottom shelf. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the middle shelf and F must be on the bottom shelf. G must be on the same shelf as H. Therefore, H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. Thus, the answer is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom

  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
  - I is placed on the middle shelf
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M
  
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf, and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf. This means that more than two books are on the bottom shelf. 
  A: There is no information about F and G being placed on the same shelf, so this choice cannot be true.
  B: There is no information about G and H being placed on the same shelf, so this choice cannot be true.
  C: Since H is on the top shelf, it cannot be on the same shelf as M, which means that this choice cannot be true.
  D: There is no information about I and G being placed on the same shelf, so this choice cannot be true.
  E: Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, K and O cannot be on the same shelf. This choice cannot be true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - Each shelf has at least two books.
  
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on:
  - H cannot be placed on the top shelf because that would mean L is placed on the top shelf, which violates the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - H cannot be placed on the middle shelf because that would mean L is placed on the middle shelf, which violates the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - Therefore, H must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  - Since each shelf has at least two books, L cannot be placed on the bottom shelf with H. Therefore, L must be placed on the top or middle shelf.
  - If L is placed on the middle shelf, then O must be placed on the top shelf, which violates the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, L must be placed on the top shelf.
  - Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, and each shelf has at least two books, F and M must be placed on the middle shelf together.
  - This leaves G and O to be placed on the bottom shelf together, and K and I to be placed on the middle shelf together.
  - Therefore, K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).

  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf. This means that F and M must also be on the middle shelf, and K, G, and H must be on the top shelf. Since G and H are on the same shelf, the answer is (B) G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 5:

  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, then K and M must be on the top shelf, and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, then G and H must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, the only option that must be true is that G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other. Answer("B").
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - There are exactly three shelves.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  
Analysis:
  - If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the top or middle shelf.
  - If L is on the top shelf, then O must be on the middle or top shelf, which would violate the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - Therefore, L must be on the middle shelf and O must be on the top shelf.
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, then K must be on the top shelf and F and M must be on the middle shelf.
  - Therefore, G and H must be on the bottom shelf, and I must be on the middle shelf with F and M.
  - None of the given choices are true based on this arrangement.

  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H and M must be on the same shelf as each other. Therefore, the answer is (C). Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are on each shelf.

  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Action: Answer("C") 

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, M and F must be on the top or middle shelf. However, we know that F is on the same shelf as M, so they must both be on the middle shelf. This means that G and K must be on the top shelf, and H, I, L, and O must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - There are exactly three shelves.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  
Analysis:
  - If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - If L is on the middle shelf, then O must be on the top shelf and K must be on the middle shelf. This means F and G must be on the bottom shelf with M on the same shelf as F.
  - If L is on the bottom shelf, then O must be on the middle or bottom shelf and K must be on the top shelf. This means F and G must be on the bottom shelf with M on the same shelf as F.
  - Therefore, the only option that must be true is that F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: The assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  E: Xu is assigned parking space #5.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  - Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6. According to the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, Xu must be assigned parking space #2, and Souza must be assigned parking space #1. Finally, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #3. The assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
- Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
- Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
- No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.

Analysis:
- Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
- If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. This means that Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 and Souza must be assigned parking space #2. Vaughn can then be assigned parking space #3. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
- If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3, then the assignments of the other parking spaces are not fully and uniquely determined.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces:
    - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
    
A: Souza is assigned parking space #1. This is not enough information to fully and uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees. We do not know where the other employees will be assigned.
B: Young is assigned parking space #2. This is not enough information to fully and uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees. We do not know where the other employees will be assigned.
C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3. This is not enough information to fully and uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees. We do not know where the other employees will be assigned.
D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4. This is enough information to fully and uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees. According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Young must be assigned parking space #3. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Souza must be assigned parking space #1 and Xu must be assigned parking space #5. Togowa is the only employee left, so Togowa must be assigned parking space #6.
E: Xu is assigned parking space #5. This is enough information to fully and uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees. According to the rules, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Souza must be assigned parking space #1 and Xu must be assigned parking space #5. Robertson must be assigned parking space #4, so Young must be assigned parking space #3. Togowa is the only employee left, so Togowa must be assigned parking space #6.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces:
    - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Solution: 
  From the rules, we know that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4, and Young must be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Togowa can be assigned any of the remaining parking spaces, but since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3. Finally, Vaughn can be assigned the remaining parking space, which is either #2 or #6. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees to be assigned to six different parking spaces.
  Young > Togowa
  Xu > Souza
  Robertson > Young
  Robertson can only be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  If Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, then the only parking spaces left for Xu, Young, Togowa, Souza, and Vaughn are #5 and #6. 
  Robertson > Young, so Young cannot be assigned parking space #5. 
  Xu > Souza, so Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5. 
  Young > Togowa, so Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5. 
  Therefore, Xu and Vaughn must be assigned parking spaces #5 and #6, respectively. 
  The only parking spaces left for Young and Togowa are #2 and #3. 
  If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #3. 
  If Young is assigned parking space #3, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #2. 
  Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces is not fully and uniquely determined if Young is assigned parking space #2 or #3.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  There are six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. 
  If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, and Xu must be assigned parking space #3. 
  If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #2. 
  However, if Souza is assigned parking space #1, then there is no valid parking space left for Robertson. 
  Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces:
    - Young > Togowa
    - Xu > Souza
    - Robertson > Young
    - Robertson = #1, #2, #3, or #4

Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3, then Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Robertson, which would violate the rule that Robertson > Young. 
  Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #4. 
  This means that Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6. 
  By the rule Xu > Souza, Xu must be assigned parking space #6 and Souza must be assigned parking space #2. 
  Finally, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #1. 
  Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analysis:
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. Souza and Vaughn must be assigned parking spaces #1 and #2, respectively. Togowa must be assigned parking space #3. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Solution:
  If Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, then the highest-numbered parking space that Robertson can be assigned is #4.
  According to the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, Young must be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3.
  According to the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Young must be assigned parking space #2 or #3.
  According to the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces:
    - Young > Togowa
    - Xu > Souza
    - Robertson > Young
    - Robertson ∈ {#1, #2, #3, #4}
    
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Since Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, it follows that Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, it follows that Souza must be assigned parking space #1 or #2, Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, and Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. Since no two employees can be assigned the same parking space, it follows that the only available parking spaces for Vaughn and Togowa are #3 and #4, and they can be assigned in either order. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Choices:
  A: F or else K
  B: F or else M
  C: K or else M
  D: M or else Q
  E: P or else Q
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Solution:
  If both G and H are selected, then we can have at most one botanist. This is because if we have more than one botanist, then we can have at most one zoologist, which means we cannot have at least one scientist from each type. 
  If we have at most one botanist, then we must have at least one zoologist and at least one chemist. 
  If F is selected, then we cannot select K. If K is selected, then we cannot select M. If M is selected, then we must select both P and R. 
  Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either K or M.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  We need at least one scientist from each type (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
  If we select more than one botanist, we can select at most one zoologist.
  If we select M, we must select both P and R.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  
  If both G and H are selected, we have to choose at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If we choose F, we can select at most one zoologist. 
  If we choose K, we cannot choose F. 
  If we choose M, we must choose both P and R.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are selected, we must choose at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  We cannot choose both F and K, so we need to choose one of them or M. 
  If we choose F, we can select at most one zoologist. 
  If we choose K, we cannot choose F. 
  If we choose M, we must choose both P and R.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:

  The panel must include at least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are selected, then we must consider all possible combinations of the remaining scientists to satisfy the conditions. 
  If we select F, then we cannot select K, and we cannot select M. Therefore, we must select at least one zoologist, and we can select either P or R.
  If we select K, then we cannot select F, and we cannot select M. Therefore, we must select at least one zoologist, and we can select either P or R.
  If we select M, then we must select both P and R, and we cannot select either F or K.
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or K if both G and H are among the scientists selected.
  
Action: Answer("A")

  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and one zoologist.
  
  A: F or else K - This option is not correct because it does not guarantee the inclusion of at least one botanist and one zoologist.
  B: F or else M - This option is not correct because it does not guarantee the inclusion of at least one botanist and one zoologist.
  C: K or else M - This option is not correct because it does not guarantee the inclusion of at least one botanist and one zoologist.
  D: M or else Q - This option is not correct because it does not guarantee the inclusion of at least one botanist and one zoologist.
  E: P or else Q - This option is correct because it guarantees the inclusion of at least one botanist and one zoologist. If G and H are selected, then at least one botanist is already selected. Therefore, selecting either P or Q will guarantee the inclusion of at least one zoologist.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. Also, if F is not selected, then K must be selected to ensure that there is at least one botanist. If F is selected, then K cannot be selected. If M is not selected, then either P or R or both must not be selected. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  
  A: F or else K - This is not necessarily true. If F is not selected, K must be selected, but if F is selected, K cannot be selected.
  B: F or else M - This is not necessarily true. If F is not selected, K must be selected, but if F is selected, K cannot be selected. Also, if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  C: K or else M - This is not necessarily true. If F is not selected, K must be selected, but if F is selected, K cannot be selected. Also, if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  D: M or else Q - This is not necessarily true. If M is not selected, either P or R or both must not be selected.
  E: P or else Q - This is not necessarily true. If M is not selected, either P or R or both must not be selected.

Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are selected, then there must be one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist selected. 
  If F is not selected, then either K or M must be selected. 
  If K is not selected, then either F or M must be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we need to determine the possible combinations of the remaining scientists that satisfy the given conditions. 
  We know that we need at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then either K or M must be selected. 
  If K is not selected, then either F or M must be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. 
  Therefore, the only possible combination that satisfies all the given conditions is if G, H, and either F or K are selected. 
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Solution:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  From the given options, only A and C include either F or K, which are the only botanists and chemists in the list.
  If we select both G and H, we still need one zoologist, which can only be either P or Q.
  If we select F, we cannot select K because F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, we must select K.
  If we select H, we cannot select M because K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, we must select M.
  So, the panel will include F, G, H, K, and M, and both P and R must be selected because M is selected.
  Therefore, the answer is C: K or else M. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either F or K. But, F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, if G and H are among the scientists selected, then K cannot be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Therefore, if G and H are among the scientists selected, then M cannot be selected. So, the panel must include F.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  A panel of five scientists will be formed from among three botanists, three chemists, and three zoologists.
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we have two cases:
  Case 1: G and H are the only botanists selected. In this case, we must select at least one chemist and one zoologist. Since we cannot select more than one zoologist, we must select either P or R. If M is not selected, then we must select either F or K. If M is selected, then we must select K. Therefore, the panel must include either F or else K. 
  Case 2: One of F, G, or H is not selected. In this case, we must select at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. If M is selected, then we must select both P and R. Therefore, we cannot select K. Therefore, the panel must include F or else M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we know that at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist have been selected. We also know that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, we can conclude that at most one botanist has been selected. We also know that F and K cannot both be selected, so if G and H are selected, then F cannot be selected. Finally, we know that if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  
  A: F or K cannot be selected if G and H are selected. Also, we know that at most one botanist can be selected, so this option is not valid.
  B: This option is not valid because if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  C: This option is valid because it includes K or M, which are both chemists. We know that at least one chemist must be selected, so this option is possible.
  D: This option is not valid because it only includes one zoologist, and we know that at least one zoologist must be selected. Also, if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  E: This option is valid because it includes both P and Q, which are zoologists. We know that at least one zoologist must be selected, so this option is possible.

  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  A: Kim and Mahr are not mentioned to work in Zone 3.

  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, the remaining sales representative must work in Zone 3. Also, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.

A: Kim and Mahr are not mentioned as working in the same sales zone as any of the other sales representatives, so we cannot determine if they work in Zone 3.
B: Kim is not mentioned as working in the same sales zone as any of the other sales representatives, so we cannot determine if she works in Zone 3. Tiao is mentioned as working in Zone 2, so he cannot work in Zone 3.

  B: Kim, Tiao - Udall must be in Zone 2, so there are not enough sales representatives to fill Zone 3.
  C: Parra, Quinn - Parra cannot be in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. So, there are not enough sales representatives to fill Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - This combination is possible. Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 1 or Zone 3, so there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The company has seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find the list of sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  From the given information, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, neither Parra nor Udall can work in Zone 3. This means that either Kim, Mahr, or Quinn must work in Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, we can eliminate choice A and B. Also, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so we can eliminate choice C. This leaves us with choices D and E. Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, they cannot both work in Zone 3. Therefore, the only possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Parra, Quinn, and either Kim or Mahr.
  
Action: Answer("E")

  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  Since there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, we can eliminate choices A and B, which only have one representative in Zone 3. 
  Choice C has both Parra and Quinn working in the same sales zone, but it doesn't have enough representatives for Zone 3. 
  Choice D has three representatives working in Zone 3, but it includes Tiao, who cannot work in the same zone as Udall. 
  Choice E has all four representatives who are not excluded by the given conditions, and it has enough representatives for Zone 3.

Action: Answer("E")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Analysis:
  - If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we can assume that the first batch of one kind of cookie must be made on Wednesday or Thursday, and the third batch of the other kind of cookie must be made on Wednesday or Thursday as well.
  - Since there are only three batches of each kind of cookie, and we have already accounted for two batches (one from each kind of cookie), the remaining batch for each kind of cookie must be made on a different day.
  - Using the given information, we can determine the exact days on which each batch of cookies is made.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - If we assume that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday as well (because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies).
  - This means that exactly two batches of cookies are made on Thursday, so (B) could be false.
Response 1:

  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. 
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then it means that:
  - The first batch of one kind of cookie is made on the same day as the third batch of another kind of cookie.
  - The first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
  - The third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Let's check each option:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - This is true as we know that at least one batch is made on Monday, and three batches are made on Thursday and Friday.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - This is false as we know that the third batch of one kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - This is false as we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and it could be more than one batch.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - This is true as we know that the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Tuesday, and the third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. - This is false as we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Friday, and it could be more than one batch.

  - Tuesday: oatmeal 2, peanut butter 1, sugar 2
  - Wednesday: oatmeal 3, peanut butter 2, sugar 1
  - Thursday: peanut butter 3, sugar 3
  - Friday: peanut butter 2, sugar 2
  In this scenario, statement B could be false since only one batch is made on Wednesday.

Scenario 2: Oatmeal's first batch is made on the same day as peanut butter's third batch.
  - Monday: At least one batch is made. (oatmeal 1, sugar 1)
  - Tuesday: oatmeal 2, peanut butter 1, sugar 2
  - Wednesday: oatmeal 3, sugar 1, peanut butter 2

  oatmeal - Wednesday
  peanut butter - Monday
  sugar - Friday
  
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - This is true since we have 3 kinds of cookies and 5 days to make them.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - This is false since only one batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - This is false since two batches of cookies are made on Monday (peanut butter and oatmeal).
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - This is true since the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of sugar cookies are made on Tuesday.

  - We can use this information to eliminate some of the answer choices:
    - A is true based on the given information.
    - B is true because there are three kinds of cookies, and each kind has three batches, so at least two batches of cookies are made each day.
    - C is false because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and we just determined that one kind of cookie's first batch is made on Wednesday. Therefore, it is possible that no batches of that kind of cookie are made on Monday.
    - D is true because there are three kinds of cookies, and each kind has three batches, so exactly two batches of cookies are made on each of Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
    - E is true based on the given information.
  - Therefore, the answer is C.

  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member, because if Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, the three project members must be selected from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be the project leader. If Ruiz is a project member, then Ruiz must be the project leader, because Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, Quinn must also be a project member. If Quinn and Ruiz are project members, then neither of them can be the project leader, because they can be project members only if leading the project. Therefore, the project leader must be Xue. In this case, the three project members are Quinn, Ruiz, and Xue. Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Quinn must be a project member.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member.
  We need to find one worker who must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, we must select Quinn or Ruiz as the project leader.
  We need to select two more workers from the remaining five: Smith, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  Since Taylor is not a project member, we must select Wells as a project member.
  If we select Verma as a project member, then we cannot select Wells or Ruiz.
  Therefore, we must select Xue as the third project member.
  Thus, the answer is D: Wells.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The project will have 3 members and 1 leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a member if they are leading the project.
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be a member.
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member either, since they must be selected together.
  Therefore, the project members are selected from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Therefore, the project leader must be selected from Quinn, Xue, or Wells.
  If Wells is not selected, then either Ruiz or Verma must be selected, since they can only be members if they are leading the project. Therefore, the project leader must be selected from Quinn, Xue, or the person selected from Ruiz and Verma.
  In either case, Xue must be a project member since they are the only remaining worker.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three workers and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member either, because if Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, the three project members must be selected from the following four workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, and Wells.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If Taylor is not a project member, then the three project members must be selected from the following four workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, and Wells. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member, so the project leader must be selected from Quinn or Xue. 
  If Wells is not a project member, then the project leader must be selected from Quinn, Ruiz, or Xue. 
  In either case, Quinn must be a project member, because Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. 
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Quinn must be a project member.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member either since "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be." 
  Therefore, the three project members are selected from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member. 
  Since exactly one of the project members will be the project leader, the leader must be selected from the remaining four workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Taylor, and Xue.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, if neither Quinn nor Ruiz is the project leader, then neither of them can be a project member. 
  If Taylor is not a project member, then the project leader must be selected from the remaining three workers: Quinn, Ruiz, and Xue. 
  Therefore, at least one of Quinn, Ruiz, or Xue must be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. This means that Wells cannot be a project member either because if Wells is a project member, then Ruiz and Verma cannot be. Therefore, the project members must be chosen from Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, and Xue.
  
  If Quinn is not a project member, then Ruiz must be the project leader, but this is not possible because Wells cannot be a project member if Ruiz is a project leader. Therefore, Quinn must be a project member and the project leader. This means that Ruiz cannot be a project member. The remaining workers are Verma and Xue, so one of them must be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have three members, and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, the constraint about Taylor and Smith does not apply. 
  We know that the project must have three members and one of them must be the leader. Let's consider the cases where Wells is a member and where Wells is not a member:
  Case 1: Wells is a project member
    In this case, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, the project members must be selected from the group {Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, Xue}. Since Wells is a member, we need to select two more members from the group {Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Xue}. We also know that one of the members must be the leader. Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, and Wells is already a member, the leader must be selected from the group {Smith, Taylor, Xue}. However, we know that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, the leader must be either Smith or Taylor. In this case, Verma cannot be a project member.
  Case 2: Wells is not a project member
    In this case, we need to select three members from the group {Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Xue}. Since Taylor is not a project member, we need to select three members from the group {Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Verma, Xue}. We also know that one of the members must be the leader. Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, the leader must be selected from the group {Smith, Taylor, Verma, Xue}. However, we know that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, the leader must be either Verma or Xue. In this case, Quinn cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, the worker who must be a project member is either Verma or Smith.
Action: Answer("C") or Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" is not applicable.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, the constraint "If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be" is applicable.
  Since Taylor is not a project member, we need to select three members from the remaining six workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  We can eliminate Quinn and Ruiz from the list of potential project members because they can only be project members if they are leading the project.
  If we select Wells as a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.
  Therefore, we must select Smith, and either Verma or Xue as project members.
  Answer: Answer("C") Verma.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three workers, and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member either, because if Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, the three workers who will be selected are among Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue. If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Quinn must be the project leader, and Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. This means that the three workers who will be selected are Quinn, Wells, and Xue. Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Quinn must be a project member.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have 3 members and 1 project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member either. 
  Therefore, the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" is not applicable.
  This means that any combination of 3 workers can be selected as project members.
  However, if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, if Wells is not a project member, then either Ruiz or Verma can be a project member.
  Since only one of the three project members can be the project leader, we can conclude that if Taylor is not a project member, then Wells must be a project member to ensure that either Ruiz or Verma can also be a project member.

  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  A: We cannot determine the order of Uneasy and Xpert.
  B: Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, but we cannot determine the order of Wellspring and Zircon.
  C: Xpert performs in a later slot than Vegemite, so Xpert cannot perform in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
  D: Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, but we cannot determine if it performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
  E: Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite, so Zircon cannot perform in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are six slots numbered one through six.
  - Six bands will perform in one slot each.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
  A: We don't know where Uneasy and Xpert are performing. This statement cannot be determined from the given information.
  B: We only know that Zircon performs after Vegemite, but we don't know where Wellspring is performing. This statement cannot be determined from the given information.
  C: We only know that Xpert performs after Wellspring and Zircon, but we don't know where Uneasy is performing. This statement cannot be determined from the given information.
  D: Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, but we don't know where Wellspring is performing. This statement cannot be determined from the given information.
  E: This statement contradicts the given information that Zircon performs after Vegemite. Therefore, this statement is false.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
  A: We don't know where Uneasy or Xpert are performing, so we cannot determine if Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  B: If Wellspring performs in a later slot than Zircon, then Xpert would have to perform in slot six, which would mean that Uneasy would have to perform in slot four or five, which is not possible. Therefore, Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  C: We don't know where Uneasy or Xpert are performing, so we cannot determine if Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
  D: If Yardsign performs in slot one, two, or three, then Wellspring and Zircon would have to perform in slot four, five, or six, which would mean that Xpert would have to perform in slot six, which is not possible. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in a later slot than Wellspring.
  E: If Zircon performs in slot four, five, or six, then Uneasy would have to perform in slot one, two, or three, which is not possible. Therefore, Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Six bands will perform in six slots numbered one through six.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or two. Therefore, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots two and three, and Xpert must perform in slot four, five, or six. Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, it must perform in slot four, five, or six. Therefore, Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring. However, we cannot determine the order of Uneasy and Xpert.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are six slots numbered one through six.
  Six bands will perform in the six slots.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then we know that Zircon will perform in one of the slots four through six. We also know that Wellspring will perform in one of the slots one through three. Therefore, we can eliminate options B, C, and E. We are left with options A and D.
  If Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert, then we know that Uneasy will perform in slot one or two, and Xpert will perform in slot five or six. However, we know that Vegemite is performing in slot three, which means that Yardsign must perform in slot one or two, and Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six. Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. This leaves us with only one possible answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are six slots numbered one through six.
  There are six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  Each band performs in just one slot.
  The order must meet the following constraints:
    1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in a later slot than Vegemite. This means that Zircon must perform in either slot four, five, or six. 
  This also means that Wellspring must perform in either slot one, two, or three, and Xpert must perform in either slot four, five, or six. 
  Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite, then Uneasy must perform in either slot four, five, or six.
  Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, and Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in either slot one or two.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will perform in six different slots (slot one through slot six).
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or slot two.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or slot two. Therefore, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slot four, slot five, or slot six. According to the constraints, Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, Xpert must perform in slot six. Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and Xpert is in slot six, Uneasy must be in slot four or slot five. That means Wellspring and Zircon must be in slot four and slot five, but we don't know which one is in which slot. Finally, Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, and Wellspring must be in slot four, so Yardsign must be in slot one or slot two. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The six slots at the benefit concert are numbered slot one through slot six.
  The six bands are Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then we know that Zircon must perform in one of the slots four, five, or six.
  
Analysis:
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or two, and Wellspring must perform in slot two or three. 
  Xpert must perform in slot four, five, or six. 
  Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six. 
  Zircon must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots numbered one through six.
  - There are six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Each band will perform in just one slot.
  - The order must meet the following constraints:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Process:
  - According to the constraints, Vegemite performs in slot three, which means that Yardsign must perform in slot one or two.
  - If Yardsign performs in slot one, then Uneasy must perform in slot five or six, and Zircon must perform in slot four or five, which is not possible.
  - Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot two, which means that Uneasy performs in slot four or five, and Zircon performs in slot four or five as well.
  - Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Zircon performs in slot four or five, then Wellspring must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  - Therefore, the only option that must be true is that Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must be recruited last. 
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Tao can't be recruited sixth. 
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas can't be recruited sixth either. 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn can't be recruited first. 
  Therefore, Rovero could be recruited third, and Stanton could be recruited second.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must have been recruited last. This means that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so he must have been recruited either first, second, or third. Quinn was recruited before Rovero, so he couldn't have been recruited first. Peters was recruited fourth, so he couldn't have been recruited first, second, or third. Villas was recruited immediately before White, so she couldn't have been recruited sixth. 
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Therefore, Stanton could have been recruited second.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the accomplices' recruitment is Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  
Analysis:
  We know that White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao. Therefore, we can conclude that White was recruited first, second or third. Since Peters was recruited fourth, Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Villas was recruited immediately before White, we can conclude that the order of recruitment is Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Peters, Stanton, Tao. Therefore, Tao was recruited sixth.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The order of the accomplices' recruitment is Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must be recruited fifth or seventh. If Tao is recruited seventh, then Villas must be recruited sixth, which is not possible because Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, Tao must be recruited fifth. Since Peters was recruited fourth, then Quinn must be recruited first or second. If Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero must be recruited third, and Stanton must be recruited sixth, which is not possible because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, Quinn must be recruited second, and Rovero must be recruited third. Stanton must be recruited first or seventh. If Stanton was recruited first, then Tao must be recruited sixth, which is not possible because Tao was recruited fifth. Therefore, Stanton must be recruited seventh, and Tao must be recruited sixth.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Using the given information, we can create a timeline of the recruitment order:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Peters
5. 
6. 
7. 

If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then we can infer that the timeline must look like this:
1. 
2. 
3. White
4. Rovero
5. Tao
6. 
7. Villas

Now we can check which of the given options could be true:
A. Quinn was recruited first. - This is not possible as Peters was recruited fourth.
B. Rovero was recruited third. - This is possible based on our timeline.
C. Stanton was recruited second. - This is not possible as Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
D. Tao was recruited sixth. - This is possible based on our timeline.
E. Villas was recruited sixth. - This is not possible as Villas was recruited immediately before White.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then we know that the order of recruitment is: [Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, Stanton].
  A: Quinn cannot be recruited first because Peters was recruited fourth.
  B: Rovero cannot be recruited third because Peters was recruited fourth and Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  C: Stanton cannot be recruited second because Peters was recruited fourth.
  D: Tao can be recruited sixth since he is immediately after Rovero.
  E: Villas cannot be recruited sixth because White is recruited after her.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then we know that the order of recruitment for these three individuals is White, Rovero, and Tao. 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be the first person recruited. 
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Tao cannot be the sixth person recruited. 
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas cannot be the sixth person recruited.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
  Since Tao was not recruited sixth, and Villas and Quinn were recruited earlier than Tao, the only possible option is that Stanton was recruited second.
Response 7:

  1. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Peters was recruited fourth.
  5. The accomplices were recruited one at a time.
  
Using the given information, we can deduce the following:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the first three recruits is: [unknown], [unknown], [unknown].
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be one of the first three recruits.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White must be one of the last two recruits.
  4. If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of the last four recruits is: [unknown], White, Rovero, Tao.
  5. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton must be one of the first three recruits.

Based on the above deductions, we can conclude that:
  A: Quinn was recruited first - This is possible, since Quinn must be one of the first three recruits.
  B: Rovero was recruited third - This is not possible, since Peters was recruited fourth and Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  C: Stanton was recruited second - This is not possible, since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero and Stanton must be one of the first three recruits.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth - This is not possible, since Peters was recruited fourth and the accomplices were recruited one at a time.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth - This is not possible, since Peters was recruited fourth and Villas was recruited immediately before White.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we know that Peters was recruited fourth and Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, the order of recruitment for Peters, Villas, and White is Peters, Villas, White. Also, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, the order of recruitment for Quinn and Rovero is Quinn, Rovero. We also know that Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao. Therefore, the order of recruitment for Rovero and Tao is Rovero, Tao. We also know that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.

  A: We don't know if Quinn was recruited first or not. So, A cannot be true.
  B: The order of recruitment for Quinn and Rovero is Quinn, Rovero. Therefore, Rovero cannot be recruited third. So, B cannot be true.
  C: We know that Tao was not recruited immediately before or after Stanton. So, C cannot be true.
  D: The order of recruitment for Rovero and Tao is Rovero, Tao. Therefore, Tao cannot be recruited sixth. So, D cannot be true.
  E: The order of recruitment for Peters, Villas, and White is Peters, Villas, White. Therefore, Villas cannot be recruited sixth. So, E cannot be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are on each shelf.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - Since there are at least 2 books on each shelf, and I is on the middle shelf, there must be at least 2 books on the top and bottom shelves.
  - Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf.
  - F is on the same shelf as M, so they must both be on the top, middle, or bottom shelf together.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf with L.
  - G and H have not been placed yet, but we know they cannot be on the same shelf as K, I, O, or L, so they must be on the top or bottom shelf with F and M.
  - Since there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf, and we know that F and M are not on the bottom shelf, we can eliminate choices A and B.
  - Since K cannot be on the bottom shelf, we can eliminate choice C.
  - Since G and H must be on the top or bottom shelf with F and M, we can eliminate choice E.
  - Therefore, the answer is D: F, G, M, O.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Using the given conditions, we can infer that:
  - The top shelf has at most 2 books.
  - The middle shelf has exactly 1 book (I).
  - The bottom shelf has at least 3 books.
  - K and O are on different shelves.
  - F and M are on the same shelf, which cannot be the top shelf.
  
Option A violates the condition that the bottom shelf has at least 3 books.
Option B violates the condition that H is not on the same shelf as F or M.
Option C violates the condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
Option D is a possible arrangement, where F, G, and M are on the bottom shelf, and O is on the top shelf.
Option E violates the condition that L is placed on a lower shelf than O.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  - Choice A cannot be correct because it only has two books, and the question states that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - Choice B cannot be correct because it has H on the bottom shelf, but K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and H is not one of the books that is higher than F.
  - Choice C cannot be correct because it does not have any of the books that are placed on the middle shelf, and I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - Choice D cannot be correct because it has G and O on the bottom shelf, but O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and G is not one of the books that is higher than L.
  - Choice E could be correct because it has G, H, L, and M on the bottom shelf, and it satisfies the conditions that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, I is placed on the middle shelf, K is placed on a higher shelf than F, O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are on each shelf.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - From the given conditions, we know that I is on the middle shelf, so it is not on the bottom shelf.
  - We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since there are at least 2 books on each shelf, and we already have I and F/M placed, we can eliminate options C and E because they do not have enough books for the bottom shelf.
  - We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the bottom shelf.
  - Finally, we know that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so we can eliminate option A because it only has 2 books on the bottom shelf.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O).
  - There are 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - At least 2 books are on each shelf.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Using the given conditions, we can deduce that I must be on the middle shelf, so we can eliminate answer choices C, D, and E because they do not include I on the middle shelf. 

We know that F and M are on the same shelf, so they must be either both on the top shelf, both on the middle shelf, or both on the bottom shelf. However, we also know that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so we can eliminate answer choice A because it only includes two books on the bottom shelf. 

That leaves us with answer choice B: F, H, M. This is a possible list of books placed on the bottom shelf because it includes at least two books on the bottom shelf (F and H) and also includes F and M on the same shelf. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  A: F, M cannot be the complete and accurate list of books placed on the bottom shelf, because there must be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  B: F, H, M cannot be the complete and accurate list of books placed on the bottom shelf, because there must be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  C: G, H, K cannot be the complete and accurate list of books placed on the bottom shelf, because K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  D: F, G, M, O could be the complete and accurate list of books placed on the bottom shelf. This satisfies the condition that there must be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and F and M are placed on the same shelf.
  E: G, H, L, M cannot be the complete and accurate list of books placed on the bottom shelf, because O is placed on a higher shelf than L.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  We know that there are exactly three shelves, and at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  Since there are exactly three shelves and at least two books are placed on each shelf, we can eliminate choices C and E because they have four books listed.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so we can eliminate choice A because it only has two books listed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can eliminate choice D because it does not have I listed on the middle shelf.
  That leaves us with choice B.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  - Choice A cannot be correct because it only has two books on the bottom shelf, which is fewer than the number of books on the top shelf.
  - Choice B cannot be correct because H is not placed on the same shelf as F and M.
  - Choice C cannot be correct because none of the books listed are placed on the same shelf as I.
  - Choice D cannot be correct because O is not placed on the same shelf as any of the books listed.
  - Choice E cannot be correct because L is not placed on the same shelf as any of the books listed.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are eight books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - From the given conditions, we know that I must be on the middle shelf, and K and O must be on a higher shelf than F.
  - We also know that F and M must be on the same shelf, and that there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - Therefore, the only possible configuration for the bottom shelf is F, M, and one other book.
  - The only answer choice that includes both F and M is (B), which also includes H.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  - Since I is placed on the middle shelf, it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the same shelf as M.
  - Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is on the bottom shelf.
  - Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, they must be on the same shelf, and therefore cannot be split between the top and bottom shelves.
  
Analysis:
  - We know that at least two books are placed on each shelf and that there are exactly three shelves. Therefore, there must be at least two books on the bottom shelf and at most two books on the top shelf.
  - We also know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there cannot be two books on the bottom shelf and two books on the top shelf.
  - From the remaining books (G, H, and O), we can only place one of them on the bottom shelf, since there must be at least two books on each shelf.
  - Therefore, the only possible complete and accurate list of books placed on the bottom shelf is F, G, and M.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are six cookbooks: K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  - Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons: fall or spring.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  - K and N must be published in the same season.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Action: Answer("D")
  
Explanation:
  - Option A is not correct because it does not have the same effect as the original condition. It only affects the publication of M and L, not M and N.
  - Option B is not correct because it affects N and P, not M and N.
  - Option C is not correct because it affects M and P, not M and N.
  - Option D is correct because it has the same effect as the original condition. If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This is the same as saying that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  - Option E is not correct because it affects O and N, not M and N.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year.
  - Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
  - A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This condition does not have any direct relationship with the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  - B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This condition does not have any direct relationship with the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  - C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This condition does not have any direct relationship with the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  - D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This condition is equivalent to the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, because it ensures that M and N are always published in different seasons.
  - E: If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This condition does not have any direct relationship with the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year.
  - Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  - The original condition is "If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring." This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  - Choice A is not equivalent to the original condition because it does not mention N and it requires L to be published in the fall.
  - Choice B is not equivalent to the original condition because it mentions N and P being published in the same season, which is not a requirement in the original condition.
  - Choice C is not equivalent to the original condition because it mentions M and P being published in different seasons, which is not a requirement in the original condition.
  - Choice D is equivalent to the original condition because it states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season, which is the same requirement as the original condition.
  - Choice E is not equivalent to the original condition because it mentions O and N being published in the same season, which is not a requirement in the original condition.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The original condition is: If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  A: This condition is not related to the original one.
  B: This condition is not related to the original one.
  C: This condition is not related to the original one.
  D: This condition is the same as the original one but with the seasons reversed.
  E: This condition is not related to the original one.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:

  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This condition does not have the same effect as the original condition.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This condition does not have the same effect as the original condition.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This condition does not have the same effect as the original condition.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This condition has the same effect as the original condition.
  E: If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This condition does not have the same effect as the original condition.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  The original rule states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season. Choice D has the same effect because it states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in different seasons. The other choices do not have the same effect on the publication schedule.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This condition does not have the same effect as the given condition.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This condition does not have the same effect as the given condition.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This condition does not have the same effect as the given condition.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  A: This condition does not have the same effect as the original condition because it does not involve M and N. 
  B: This condition does not have the same effect as the original condition because it involves N and P, not M and N.
  C: This condition does not have the same effect as the original condition because it involves M and P, not M and N.
  D: This condition has the same effect as the original condition because it involves M and N and states that they cannot be published in the same season.
  E: This condition does not have the same effect as the original condition because it involves O and N, not M and N.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six cookbooks: K, L, M, N, O, and P
  - Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons: fall or spring
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: 
  Substituting the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, means that if M is published in the fall, something else must be published in the spring. Therefore, the correct answer is A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The original rule states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This rule is different from the original rule and does not have the same effect.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This rule is different from the original rule and does not have the same effect.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This rule is different from the original rule and does not have the same effect.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This rule is different from the original rule and does not have the same effect.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the four walls has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on wall 1.
    - This is because no wall can have only watercolors and no wall can have only paintings by one student. Therefore, wall 2 must have one painting by Isaacs and one painting by another student, and wall 3 must have one painting by Franz and one painting by another student. Since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs, wall 2 cannot have a painting by Franz, and wall 3 cannot have a painting by Isaacs. Therefore, Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on wall 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Each of the four art students will display exactly two paintings - an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room - walls 1, 2, 3, and 4 - with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  - If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Isaacs's oil will be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 3.
  - If Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 3, and it cannot be displayed on wall 4 either since Isaacs's oil is already displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Therefore, Franz's watercolor must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 2.
  - Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student displays exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1. This is because:
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, the only option that must be displayed on wall 1 is Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Each of the four walls must have exactly two paintings.
  2. No wall can have only watercolors.
  3. No wall can have only one student's work.
  4. No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 4. But Isaacs's oil is already displayed on wall 4, so it cannot be on wall 1. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor and oil are both displayed on wall 2 and wall 4, respectively. Since no wall can have only one student's work, and no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs, then wall 1 must have one painting by Greene and one painting by Hidalgo. Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of wall 3. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each of the four walls has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on walls 1 and 4. This is because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, and Isaacs's oil is already displayed on wall 4. Also, since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, Hidalgo's paintings must include at least one oil painting. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 1, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 4. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs, each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.

  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  - Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4.
  - Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 2.
  - Since no wall can have only watercolors, Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  - Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 3.
  - Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  - Thus, the answer is C, Greene's watercolor.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Four art students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs
  - Each student will display exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor

Explanation: 
  - Since Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  - Since no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1.
  - Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1.
  - Since no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, Hidalgo's oil and Hidalgo's watercolor cannot both be displayed on wall 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor, displayed in the upper and lower positions.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Using the given information, we can deduce that:
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4, and his watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
  - Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, so his watercolor cannot be on wall 3 or wall 4.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil, so Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 3 or wall 4.
  - No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs, so neither of their paintings can be on wall 1.
  - Since no wall can have only watercolors, and we know that Isaacs's watercolor is on wall 2, then Isaacs's oil must be on wall 4, and Hidalgo's paintings must be on wall 1.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:

  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then:
  - Isaacs's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 4.
  - Greene's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 4.
  - Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on wall 2 and wall 3.
  - Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because it would mean that Franz's oil is also displayed on wall 2.
  - Therefore, Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  
  Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:
  - Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 2, since his watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 1, since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 4, since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Response 0:

  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another.
  
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday. We know that George gives a report on Tuesday and that exactly two reports are given each day. Therefore, Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday since all three of them will have given their reports by then.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which is impossible since George is giving his report on that day.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Since Robert cannot give an afternoon report, he must give his report on Monday, leaving Olivia to give her report on Wednesday. This scenario satisfies all the given conditions.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday. If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then Robert must give his report on Tuesday, leaving Nina to give her report on Wednesday. However, this scenario violates the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday. If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then Nina must give her report on Monday, leaving Helen and Irving to give their reports on Tuesday. However, this scenario violates the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
  A: Helen giving a report on Wednesday does not work because Helen has to give a report on the day after Nina gives a report, and Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina giving a report on Monday does not work because if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, but George has to give a report on Tuesday, so this is not possible.
  C: Nina giving a report on Tuesday works because then Helen and Irving can give reports on Wednesday.
  D: Olivia giving a report on Monday does not work because Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
  E: Robert giving a report on Wednesday works because George has to give a report on Tuesday, and Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday, so Robert has to give a report on Wednesday.

- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give their reports in the morning.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday, because that would mean Helen and Irving would have to give a report on Tuesday, which is not possible since George is already giving a report on that day.
- Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday, and Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday.
- This leaves Lenore and Kyle to give reports on Monday and Tuesday, but we don't know which one will give a report on which day.
- So, the only statement that could be true is that Nina gives a report on Tuesday.

  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then George must give his report on Tuesday. Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, and Robert is giving a report, then Robert must give his report in the morning. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Wednesday, which means that on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports. Since George is giving his report on Tuesday, then Nina's report cannot be given on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Wednesday. This means that Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. Based on this, the following could be true:

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The project will have 3 members and 1 leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a member, Taylor must also be a member.
  If Wells is a member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find a condition that will completely determine the selection of the project members and leader. This means that given the condition, we can determine exactly which three workers will be selected and who will be the project leader.

A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be a member (because she must be a member if Smith is a member). This means that we only have 4 workers left to choose from: Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue. However, we cannot determine which three of these workers will be selected, because we do not know whether Quinn will be a member or not (since Quinn can only be a member if leading the project). Therefore, this condition does not completely determine the selection.

B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be a member (because Taylor must be a member if Smith is a member). This means that we only have 4 workers left to choose from: Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue. However, we cannot determine which three of these workers will be selected, because we do not know whether Quinn will be a member or not (since Quinn can only be a member if leading the project). Therefore, this condition does not completely determine the selection.

C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then we only have 5 workers left to choose from: Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Wells. We know that exactly three of these workers will be selected, so the only way to satisfy this condition is to select Ruiz, Smith, and Taylor as the members, with Ruiz as the leader. This is because if Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be (according to the third constraint), and if Wells is not a member, then we must select either Quinn or Ruiz as the leader (according to the first constraint). Therefore, this condition completely determines the selection.

D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we only have 5 workers left to choose from: Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Xue. We know that exactly three of these workers will be selected, so the only way to satisfy this condition is to select Quinn, Smith, and Taylor as the members, with Quinn as the leader. This is because if Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be (according to the second constraint), and if neither Ruiz nor Wells is a member, then we must select either Quinn or Ruiz as the leader (according to the first constraint). Therefore, this condition completely determines the selection.

E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we only have 5 workers left to choose from: Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue. We know that exactly three of these workers will be selected, so the only way to satisfy this condition is to select Quinn, Smith, and Taylor as the members, with Quinn as the leader. This is because if Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be (according to the second constraint), and if Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be (according to the third constraint). Therefore, this condition completely determines the selection.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.

  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, it is still possible to have Quinn or Ruiz as the project leader and Smith and Taylor as the other two members. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, it is still possible to have Quinn or Ruiz as the project leader and Smith and Wells as the other two members. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, it is still possible to have Quinn or Ruiz as the project leader and Smith and Taylor as the other two members. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, it is still possible to have Quinn or Ruiz as the project leader and Smith and Taylor as the other two members. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, it is not possible to have Wells as a project member. Therefore, the only possible combination is Quinn or Ruiz as the project leader and Smith and Taylor as the other two members.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three workers will be selected for the project.
  Exactly one of the three selected workers will be the project leader.

  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Analysis:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be a project member, which means that Wells, Verma, and Xue cannot be project members. Therefore, only two workers would be available for selection as project members, which is not enough to fill the three project member slots. Thus, this option cannot completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which means that Wells, Ruiz, and Verma cannot be project members. Therefore, only three workers would be available for selection as project members, which is exactly enough to fill the three project member slots. Thus, this option could completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then there are no constraints on the selection of the project members, but there are also no constraints on the selection of the project leader. Thus, this option cannot completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then there are no constraints on the selection of the project members, but there are also no constraints on the selection of the project leader. Thus, this option cannot completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then if Wells is selected, Taylor must be selected, which means that Smith must also be selected. Therefore, only three workers would be available for selection as project members, which is exactly enough to fill the three project member slots. Thus, this option could completely determine the selection for the project.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Elimination:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. - This does not determine the selection because there are still multiple possibilities for the third member and the leader.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected. - This does not determine the selection because there are still multiple possibilities for the third member and the leader.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected. - This does not determine the selection because there are still multiple possibilities for the third member and the leader.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected. - This determines the selection because if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the only option for the project leader is either Quinn or Ruiz. Therefore, the three members of the project are Smith, Taylor, and either Quinn or Ruiz as the leader.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

  Exactly 3 workers will be selected for the project.
  Exactly 1 of these 3 workers will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  To determine which statement would completely determine the selection of the project, we need to find a statement that would allow us to determine which workers must be selected and which workers cannot be selected. 
  
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, we do not know if Taylor will be selected or not. We also do not know if either Ruiz or Verma will be selected. This statement does not completely determine the selection of the project.
  
  B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, we do not know if Smith will be selected or not. We also do not know if either Ruiz or Verma will be selected. This statement does not completely determine the selection of the project.
  
  C: If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we do not know if Smith and Taylor will be selected or not. We also do not know if either Ruiz or Verma will be selected. This statement does not completely determine the selection of the project.
  
  D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, we know that Verma must be selected since only 3 workers can be selected. We also know that either Quinn or Smith must be selected since one of them must be the project leader if either of them is a project member. This statement does completely determine the selection of the project.
  
  E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, we do not know if Smith and Taylor will be selected or not. We also do not know if either Quinn or Ruiz will be selected. This statement does not completely determine the selection of the project.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must work in the same sales zone as well.
  If Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey and Mahr, then there are at least 3 sales representatives working in that zone.
  Therefore, the only possible choice is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they cannot both work in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they cannot both work in Zone 2. 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 1 or Zone 3, then Parra must work in Zone 1 and Tiao must work in Zone 2. 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 1, then Quinn and Parra must work in Zone 1 as well, which means that Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 2, so A and B are not possible. 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3, then there must be more than two sales representatives working in Zone 3, which means that Parra cannot work in Zone 3, so C is not possible. 
  Therefore, the only possible option is D, which says that Stuckey works in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs seven sales representatives to work in its three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they must work in Zone 3, because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. 
  A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2, because there are fewer sales representatives working in Zone 2 than in Zone 3.
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 1, because neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 3, and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3, because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  D: Stuckey can work in Zone 2, but we know that Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, which must be Zone 3.
  E: Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and we know that Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must work in Zone 3. Therefore, D: Stuckey works in Zone 2, could be true.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  A: There is no information about Kim's sales zone.
  B: There is no information about Mahr's sales zone.
  C: There is no information about Parra's sales zone.
  D: Stuckey can work in Zone 2 if Mahr also works in Zone 2. This is a possible scenario.
  E: Tiao can work in Zone 1 if Parra works in Zone 3 and Udall works in Zone 2. This is a possible scenario.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that sales zone because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Zone 1 and Zone 2 must each have only one sales representative. Parra cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 1 and Parra works in Zone 3. Quinn must work in the same sales zone as Parra, which is Zone 3. Kim must work in Zone 2 because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.

  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that same sales zone. This is because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Parra and Quinn must work in a different sales zone. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that Mahr, Kim, and Tiao must work in Zone 3. This leaves only Parra to work in Zone 1, and Udall to work in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - The company has 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.

  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must work in the same sales zone as well.
  - Parra cannot work in Zone 1, because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, because if Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 2, which is not possible.
  - Kim cannot work in Zone 2, because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")

  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they must both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. 
  A: We don't know where Kim works, so we cannot determine if this is true or false.
  B: We don't know where Mahr works, so we cannot determine if this is true or false.
  C: We know that Parra cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, Parra must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it is possible that Parra works in Zone 3. This choice could be true.
  D: If Stuckey works in Zone 2, then Mahr must also work in Zone 2 because Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone. But we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so this choice cannot be true.
  E: We don't know where Tiao works, so we cannot determine if this is true or false.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If X is mentioned in chapter 1, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2.

Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The mystery novel consists of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  Seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—are to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. 
  Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so it must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  T must be mentioned before W, so T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.
  Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 3, 5, 6, or 7.
  R must be mentioned in one of the remaining chapters.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  T must be mentioned before W, so T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.
  Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 3, 5, 6, or 7.
  R must be mentioned in one of the remaining chapters, which are 3, 4, 6, and 7.
  Therefore, R could be mentioned in chapter 7, so the answer is B.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. According to the constraint, T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, and it cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 either (since T must be separated from W by exactly two chapters). So, T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later. 

If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6. Therefore, U must be mentioned in chapter 5, and X must be mentioned in chapter 7. This means that S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 3, but we know that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, this case is not possible.

If T is mentioned in chapter 5, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, U must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 1. This means that S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 4, but we know that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, this case is not possible.

If T is mentioned in chapter 6 or later, then W must be mentioned in a later chapter. Therefore, U and X must be mentioned in the two chapters between T and W. This means that S and Z must be mentioned in the other two chapters between T and W, but we know that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, this case is not possible.

Therefore, the only possible option is:
Action: Answer("D")  W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  - Since W is mentioned in chapter 5, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  - S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so S must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  - That leaves R to be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 6.
  
Action: Answer("B") - R is mentioned in chapter 7.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each chapter must mention exactly one clue.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so it must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.
  Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 6 and 7 in some order.
  This leaves R to be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, depending on whether T is mentioned in chapter 3 or later.

Action: Answer("B")  
Choice B is possible if R is mentioned in chapter 7, which is possible if T is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each of the seven clues must be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so it must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, so T must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  R and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters adjacent to S, so S must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 7.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  There are seven chapters, numbered 1 through 7.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later. Since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3. If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 3 and 4, so one of them must be mentioned in chapter 5, and the other in chapter 7. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 3, and U must be mentioned in chapter 4. This satisfies all of the constraints, so the answer is (A) R is mentioned in chapter 3.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The mystery novel consists of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  - Seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—are to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - According to the constraint, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  - Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  - According to the constraint, S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  - Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  - According to the constraint, W must be mentioned after T, with exactly two chapters separating them, so W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4.
  - Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  - According to the constraint, W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so X cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  - Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  - According to the constraint, R must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 7.

Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, if X is mentioned in chapter 1, it is possible that R is mentioned in chapter 7.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
- Each of the seven clues is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
- T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1:
- U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
- W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
- If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and T and W cannot have S or Z between them. Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 4 and 5 in some order. This means that R and U must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 4 in some order. Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 7. 
- If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7, and T and W cannot have S or Z between them. Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 3 in some order. This means that R and U must be mentioned in chapters 5 and 6 in some order. Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. This is not possible because if T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and T and W cannot have S or Z between them. Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 4 and 5 in some order. This means that R and U must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 4 in some order. Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. 
B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. This is possible because R can be mentioned in any chapter except the first one, and X is mentioned in chapter 1. 
C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. This is not possible because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later, and this means that S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 3 and 5 in some order. 
D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. This is possible because if T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and T and W cannot have S or Z between them. Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 4 and 5 in some order. This means that R and U must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 4 in some order. Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 7. 
E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3. This is not possible because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later, and this means that S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 3 and 5 in some order. 

Action: Answer("B")

Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so it must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4, so S must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 6, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4, so S must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 6, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 5, so S must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 6, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 5, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6, so S must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 6, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 7, so S must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 5.
  Therefore, R can be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 7.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a valid order for the clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z, given the constraints.
  X is mentioned in chapter 1, so we can start by placing X in chapter 1 and then placing the other clues according to the constraints.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 either since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if X is in chapter 1, neither S nor Z can be in chapter 2.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so W cannot be in chapter 2.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so U must be in chapter 2.
  Therefore, the valid order for the clues is: X, U, T, R, S, W, Z.
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, W could be mentioned in chapter 5.

  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then:
  - Gagnon has two photographs in that section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  - Therefore, Gagnon's two photographs must be in either the Lifestyle or Metro section.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. (Not possible because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.)
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. (Possible if Gagnon's two photographs are in the Metro section and Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Metro section.)
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. (Not possible because Gagnon's two photographs must be in either the Lifestyle or Metro section.)
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue. (Possible if Gagnon's two photographs are in the Lifestyle section and Hue has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.)

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: 
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, Gagnon must have both photographs in either the Lifestyle or Metro section.
  - If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Gagnon, then the condition "At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section" is violated. Therefore, A is not true.
  - If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then the condition "At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section" is also violated. Therefore, C is not true.
  - If Gagnon has one photograph in the Metro section, then the other photograph in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue. This means that neither Fuentes nor Hue can have both photographs in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, D is not true.
  - If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are not by Gagnon, then Gagnon must have both photographs in the Metro section. This means that neither Fuentes nor Hue can have both photographs in the Metro section. Therefore, B is not true.
  - If both photographs in the Sports section are by Gagnon, then Fuentes and Hue cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. This means that both Fuentes and Hue must have one photograph in the Lifestyle section and one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, E is true.
  
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have either two photographs by Fuentes and none by Hue, or one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue. Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, the Lifestyle section cannot have both photographs by Hue. Therefore, the only possible option is that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. This means that the photograph in the Metro section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be either by Fuentes or Hue. However, since we already have one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue in the Lifestyle section, the photograph in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes. Therefore, the photograph in the Metro section must be by Hue. This means that both photographs in the Sports section are by Fuentes. 
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  Each of the three sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) must have exactly two different photographs, and each photograph was taken by one of the three photographers.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then there can be at most one Gagnon photograph in each of the other two sections.
  
  A: If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then there can be at most one Hue photograph in each of the other two sections. This means that there cannot be any Gagnon photograph in the Lifestyle section, which contradicts the given condition that both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  
  B: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there can be at most one Fuentes photograph and at most one Hue photograph in each of the other two sections. This means that there can be at most one Gagnon photograph in each of the other two sections. Therefore, this choice is possible.
  
  C: If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there can be at most one Fuentes photograph in each of the other two sections. This means that there cannot be any Gagnon photograph in the Lifestyle section, which contradicts the given condition that both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  
  D: If one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there can be at most one Gagnon photograph and at most one Hue photograph in each of the other two sections. This means that there can be at most one Fuentes photograph in the Lifestyle section and at most one Fuentes photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, this choice is possible.
  
  E: If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then there can be at most one Hue photograph in each of the other two sections.

  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then:
    - Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
    - Gagnon must have exactly two photographs in one of the other two sections.
    - The other photographer in that section must have at least one photograph in the section where Gagnon has no photographs.
    - If Gagnon has two photographs in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must have two photographs in the Sports section, and Hue must have one photograph in the Metro section and one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
    - If Gagnon has two photographs in the Metro section, then Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section and one photograph in the Lifestyle section, and Hue must have two photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. (Not possible because if Gagnon has both photographs in one section, then Hue can have at most one photograph in that section.)

Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Each section must have two photographs, and each photograph must be taken by one of the three photographers.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then neither of those photographs can be in the Sports section, because Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the two photographs by Gagnon must be split between the Lifestyle and Metro sections. This means that the Lifestyle section must have at least one photograph by a photographer who also has a photograph in the Metro section. The only photographer who has not been ruled out of the Lifestyle section is Hue, so at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, so if both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then both photographs in the Sports section must be by Hue. Therefore, the only choice that could be true is E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.

  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then:
    - Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
    - Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle or Metro section.
    - The other photograph in the section where both photographs are by Gagnon must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
    - If Gagnon has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes or Hue must also have a photograph in the Lifestyle section.
    - If Gagnon has a photograph in the Metro section, then Fuentes or Hue must also have a photograph in the Metro section.
    
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. (Not possible since Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle or Metro section.)
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. (Possible if Gagnon has a photograph in the Lifestyle section and the photograph by Fuentes is in the Sports section.)
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. (Not possible since Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle or Metro section.)
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue. (Possible if Gagnon has a photograph in the Metro section.)

Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs are to appear in three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Each section should have exactly two photographs.
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the photographs in the Sports section must be taken by Fuentes and Hue. According to the conditions, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Thus, both photographs in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Hue. Also, at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes. This means that the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue. Thus, (A) is not true. Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes because Fuentes has to have at least one photograph in the Sports section. Thus, (C) is not true. One photograph in the Metro section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, it cannot be both by Gagnon. Thus, (D) is not true. The only option left is (E), which states that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is possible because Hue can have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.

  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have photographs by both Fuentes and Hue. According to the given conditions, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Since there are no Gagnon photographs in the Sports section, the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be one. Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must also be one. This means that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes or Hue, and the other photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon. Thus, choice B is possible: one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  Each section must have exactly two photographs.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon has two photographs in that section and cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the number of Gagnon's photographs in the Lifestyle and Metro sections must be between 1 and 3.
  
  A: If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Lifestyle section, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  B: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Lifestyle section, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  C: If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section. However, this photograph must be by either Fuentes or Hue, which means that Gagnon cannot have two photographs in the same section. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  D: If one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, which satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, this choice is possible.
  E: If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which means that Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Sports section. However, this contradicts the given information that none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  - The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
  - From the given conditions, we can infer that the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Thus, the harmonica, lamp, and mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, and June 3rd, but not necessarily in that order.
  - From the second condition, if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and mirror must be auctioned on June 1st and the 3rd, but we cannot determine which is which.
  - From the third condition, the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. This means that the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 6th, and the vase must be auctioned on June 6th. Also, the sundial must be auctioned on either June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th. However, we cannot determine the exact date of the sundial auction.
  - From the fourth condition, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. This means that the table must be auctioned on either June 1st, June 2nd, or June 6th. However, we cannot determine the exact date of the table auction.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
  - The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd or later. This would mean that the mirror is also auctioned on June 2nd or later. But this contradicts the condition that the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This means that the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase, so it must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This means that the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th and June 5th, but we don't know which one is auctioned on which day. Finally, the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th. Therefore, the following could be true:
    - The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. (A)
    - The lamp is auctioned on June 6th. (B is false)
    - The vase is auctioned on June 5th. (C is false)
    - The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. (D is false)
    - The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. (E is false)

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we can infer that the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. 
  Also, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 6th. 
  The table cannot be auctioned on June 6th. 
  The vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. 
  From the third condition, we can infer that the sundial is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  From the fourth condition, we can infer that the table is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.

Action: Answer("B") 
  The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. 
  This is possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, and the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, which means the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Also, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, which means the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 3rd or later. Therefore, the lamp can only be auctioned on June 2nd.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Six antiques (harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase) are auctioned one per day for six consecutive days.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
  - From the third rule, we know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd at the earliest since it is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - From the fourth rule, we know that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the earliest dates for the table are June 1st or June 2nd.
  - From the second rule, we know that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the earliest dates for the harmonica and the mirror are June 1st and June 2nd, but we don't know which is which.
  - From the first rule, we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the earliest date for the sundial is June 2nd.
  - From the above analysis, we can conclude that the earliest date for the lamp is June 3rd since the sundial, table, harmonica, and mirror already have earlier dates.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
- The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
- The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
- If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd because the mirror cannot be auctioned before June 2nd.
- The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
- The sundial is auctioned before the mirror, so the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
- The sundial is auctioned before the vase, so the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
- The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
- The harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st because the sundial is not auctioned on that day. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
- If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st and the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th or later. However, this violates the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd.
- If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. However, if the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th or later, which violates the condition that the mirror is auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st and the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th or later.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
- The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
- The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
- From the first rule, we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- From the third rule, we know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
- From the fourth rule, we know that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
- If the table is auctioned before the vase, then the vase must be auctioned on June 6th, which means the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. This also means that the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. 
- If the table is auctioned before the harmonica, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd or later, which means the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th or later. This also means that the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.

Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, the lamp could be auctioned on June 3rd.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - Since the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both, and the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, the table must be auctioned on June 1st.
  - Since the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st, it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - Since the table is auctioned before the harmonica, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 2nd. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - Since the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase, and the sundial is already auctioned on June 2nd, the mirror and the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.
  - Since the harmonica must be auctioned after the table, and the table is already auctioned on June 1st, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - Therefore, the only possible dates for the harmonica are June 2nd and June 3rd.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 2nd, which is not possible since the sundial is already auctioned on June 2nd.
  - Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 3rd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th.
  - The vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, and the only remaining antique is the lamp, which must be auctioned on June 4th.
  
Action: Answer("D") - The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica is auctioned on a date later than the lamp, or both are not auctioned on the same day.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. 
  - If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
  - The sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later.
  - The table cannot be auctioned on June 4th because it would violate the condition that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  - Therefore, it is not possible for the mirror to be auctioned on June 2nd.
  
B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  - If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
  - The sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later.
  - The table can be auctioned on June 1st, which satisfies the condition that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase.
  - Therefore, it is possible for the lamp to be auctioned on June 2nd.
  - This is a valid answer.
  
C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
  - If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
  - The sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
  - The table can be auctioned on June 1st, which satisfies the condition that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase.
  - Therefore, it is not possible for the vase to be auctioned on June 2nd.
  
D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  - If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 4th or later.
  - The sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or later.
  - The table can be auctioned on June 1st, which satisfies the condition that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase.
  - Therefore, it is possible for the lamp to be auctioned on June 3rd.
  - This is a valid answer.
  
E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
  - If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 6th.
  - The sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later.
  - The table can be auctioned on June 2nd, which satisfies the condition that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase.
  - Therefore, it is not possible for the mirror to be auctioned on June 5th.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Action: 
  We know that the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  From the given conditions, we can deduce that the table cannot be auctioned on June 6th because it is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the vase must be auctioned on June 6th, which is not possible because the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the table is not auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th and June 5th, but it is not clear whether the mirror or the vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd and June 3rd, but it is not clear whether the mirror or the vase is auctioned on June 5th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd and June 3rd, and the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th and June 6th, but it is not clear which one is auctioned on which date.
  Therefore, the following could be true:
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp for the mirror to be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  From the second condition, if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, which is the last day of the auction. Therefore, the mirror must be auctioned on June 5th, which is the only day before the lamp.
  From the third condition, the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. This means that the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or June 6th, since June 2nd and June 3rd are already assigned to the sundial and the harmonica or the table.
  From the fourth condition, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 4th, since June 3rd and June 5th are already assigned to the sundial and the mirror.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays

  The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  We need to find the possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony, so they can be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. So, Lai can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. So, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. So, Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.

Solution:
  From the above analysis, we can conclude that the possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony is Frost, Knutson, and Lai.
  Therefore, the answer is (C) Gonzalez, Knutson. 
  Note that (A), (B), (D), and (E) are not possible complete assignments of photographers to the Silva University ceremony based on the given constraints.

  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, if Knutson is assigned to Silva, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned to Thorne.

Solution:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. So, Frost and Heideck must be assigned to either Silva or Thorne. If they are assigned to Silva, then at least two more photographers are required for Silva. We know that Lai cannot be assigned to Silva if Gonzalez is assigned to Silva. So, Lai and Mays must be assigned to Thorne. But, if Lai and Mays are assigned to Thorne, then Gonzalez must be assigned to Silva. This means that Knutson must also be assigned to Silva, and Heideck and Mays must be assigned to Thorne. This is a valid assignment of photographers to the ceremonies. Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
Analysis:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment must have been one of the following: 
    1- Tao - X - X - Peters - X - X - X
    2- X - Tao - X - Peters - X - X - X
    3- X - X - Tao - Peters - X - X - X
    4- X - X - X - Peters - Tao - X - X
    5- X - X - X - Peters - X - Tao - X
    6- X - X - X - Peters - X - X - Tao
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton must have been recruited either first, third, fifth, or seventh.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited either first, second, or third.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so either Villas was recruited fifth and White was recruited sixth or Villas was recruited sixth and White was recruited seventh.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Tao was recruited second, the possible orders of recruitment are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then the possible orders are 5 and 6. If White was recruited third, then the order must be 5, which means Villas was recruited sixth. Therefore, Answer D is the correct choice.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be:
1. X
2. Tao
3. X
4. Peters
5. X
6. X
7. X

The following options are possible based on the given information:
A: Quinn was recruited third. (Possible)
B: Rovero was recruited fifth. (Not possible, because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero)
C: Stanton was recruited sixth. (Not possible, because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao)
D: Villas was recruited sixth. (Not possible, because Villas was recruited immediately before White)
E: White was recruited third. (Not possible, because Peters was recruited fourth)

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  - Tao was recruited second, so Peters must have been recruited third.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited fifth and White sixth.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must have been recruited first, second, or sixth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited either first or second.
  - Therefore, if Tao was recruited second, Quinn must have been recruited first, and Stanton must have been recruited sixth.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Tao was recruited second, then only one of the following could be true.
  
Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited third.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn was recruited either first or second.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas was recruited either fifth or sixth.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton was recruited either first, fifth, or sixth.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
  If Tao was recruited second, then Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Peters was recruited fourth.
  5. The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  
If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the accomplices would be Tao, X, Y, Peters, Z, Villas, White, where X, Y and Z are the other three accomplices recruited before Peters. 

Analysis of Choices:
  A: If Tao was recruited second, then Quinn could not have been recruited third because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  B: If Tao was recruited second, then Rovero could not have been recruited fifth because Peters was recruited fourth.
  C: If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton could not have been recruited sixth because Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  D: If Tao was recruited second, then Villas could not have been recruited sixth because Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  E: If Tao was recruited second, then White could not have been recruited third because Peters was recruited fourth.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
Using the given information, we can determine the order of the accomplices as follows:
1. Peters
2. Tao
3. (unknown)
4. (unknown)
5. (unknown)
6. (unknown)
7. Villas - White

Option A: If Quinn was recruited third, then Rovero would have to be recruited fifth. However, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so this option is not possible.

Option B: If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Quinn would have to be recruited third. However, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so this option is not possible.

Option C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the only possible order for the remaining three accomplices would be: Tao, Peters, Quinn. However, we know that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so this option is not possible.

Option D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then the only possible order for the remaining three accomplices would be: Tao, Peters, Quinn. This order satisfies all the given conditions, so this is a possible option.

Option E: If White was recruited third, then the only possible order for the remaining four accomplices would be: Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao. However, we know that Peters was recruited fourth, so this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Tao was recruited second, Peters must have been recruited third.
  - Therefore, Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited first or second.
  - Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, and Peters was recruited fourth, then Villas must have been recruited fifth, and White recruited last.
  - Since Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, and Peters was recruited fourth, then Stanton must have been recruited either first, sixth, or seventh.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton could have been recruited sixth.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Tao was recruited second.
  2. Peters was recruited fourth.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.

Using the given information, we can deduce the following order of recruitment: 
  1. Peters
  2. Tao
  3. Quinn
  4. Rovero
  5. Villas
  6. White
  7. Stanton

If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be as follows:
  1. Peters
  2. Tao
  3. Quinn
  4. Rovero
  5. Villas
  6. White
  7. Stanton

Now we can check which of the options is possible:
  A: Quinn was recruited third. This is possible based on the order deduced above.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth. This is true based on the order deduced above.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth. This is not possible as Stanton was recruited last.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth. This is not possible as Villas was recruited fifth.
  E: White was recruited third. This is not possible as Quinn was recruited third.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be: 
  1. Peters
  2. Tao
  3. Quinn or Rovero
  4. The other of Quinn or Rovero
  5. Villas
  6. White
  7. Stanton

A: If Quinn was recruited third, then Rovero must be recruited fourth which violates rule 2. Incorrect.
B: If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Quinn must be recruited third which satisfies rule 2. Correct.
C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then White must be recruited fifth which violates rule 3. Incorrect.
D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then White must be recruited fifth which satisfies rule 3. Incorrect.
E: If White was recruited third, then Villas must be recruited second which violates rule 3. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first.
  
Using the given information, we can create the following table:

| Order | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Name  | P | T |   | P |   |   |   |

Option A: If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first, and Quinn cannot be recruited third because Peters was recruited third. Therefore, option A is not true.

Option B: If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first, and Rovero cannot be recruited fifth because Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, option B is not true.

Option C: If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first, and Stanton cannot be recruited sixth because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao. Therefore, option C is not true.

Option D: If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first, and Villas could be recruited sixth because Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, option D could be true.

Option E: If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first, and White cannot be recruited third because Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, option E is not true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Logic: 
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day, and its voicemail target must be 2 days. 
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target must also be 1 day. 
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. 
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Image's website target must be 1 day, and Truvest's website target must be 2 days.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions: 
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. 
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. 
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, that means Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's voicemail target must be 1 day or 2 days.
  If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days.
  If Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.
  If Image's voicemail target is 1 day, then Image's website target must be 1 day or 2 days.
  If Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, then Solide's website target must be 1 day if Truvest's website target is 2 days.
  If Solide's website target is 1 day, then Solide's voicemail target must be 1 day or 2 days.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Truvest has two targets, one for website and one for voicemail.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day and Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days. This is because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. 

Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must also be 1 day. 

Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. 

Therefore, Image's website target must be 2 days because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Truvest has two targets, one for website and one for voicemail.
  - Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  - Image has two targets, one for website and one for voicemail.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - There are three possible service targets: 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.

Action: Answer("D")
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must be 1 day. Therefore, Image's website target must be 2 days because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. So, the correct answer is D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has a website target and a voicemail target.
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is 1 day and Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is 1 day and Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is 1 day. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Solide's voicemail target is 2 days. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is 1 day. Therefore, Solide's website target is 2 days. Thus, the answer is D.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  We don't know the exact service targets for each client.
  
Analysis:
  Since Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, Truvest's voicemail target must be 1 day and its website target must be 2 days. This means Solide's website target must be shorter than 2 days, and Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 1 day. However, we don't know the exact service targets for each client, so we can't determine which of the remaining options is true.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Analysis: 
  Since Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, Truvest's website target must be 1 day and its voicemail target must be 2 days. This means that Solide's website target must be shorter than 1 day, and Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, it cannot be 2 days. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. This means that Solide's website target must be shorter than 1 day, which leaves only one option, E, as the correct answer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.

  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's voicemail target is longer than its website target.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's voicemail target is longer than its website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 1 day or 2 days.
  - According to the given conditions, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day if Truvest's website target is 2 days, or 2 days if Truvest's website target is 1 day.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, if Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's voicemail target is longer than Image's voicemail target. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day or 2 days.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, if Image's voicemail target is 1 day, then its website target must also be 1 day. If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then its website target must be 1 day or 2 days.
  
Action: Answer("C") - Image's website target is 1 day.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Each client has two service targets: one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.

  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day and Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must be 1 day as well. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. Therefore, Image's website target must be 2 days. The only option that matches this is D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The six targets are set according to the following conditions:

    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then we can infer that Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than its website target.
  
Analysis:
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than its website target.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - Therefore, Solide's website target cannot be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Therefore, Image's voicemail target cannot be 2 days or longer.
  - Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.
  - Therefore, Image's website target must also be 1 day, because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third

1. _ _ _ Y _ _ _
2. _ _ _ _ Y _ _
3. _ _ _ _ _ Y _
4. _ _ _ _ _ _ Y

Option 1: If J is second, then G must be first, and H must be third. However, this violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. Therefore, option A is not true.

Option 2: If J is third, then G must be first, and H must be second. Q and R cannot be fourth or fifth since they are consecutive articles covering the same topic. Therefore, Q cannot be third, and this violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, option B is not true.

Option 3: If Q is first, then S must be second, and R must be third. This violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, option C is not true.

Option 4: If Q is third, then S must be first, and R must be second. G must be fourth, H must be fifth, and J must be sixth. Therefore, Y must be seventh. Therefore, option D is true.

  1. Q _ S Y J G R
  2. S _ Q Y J G R
  
  A: J cannot be second in either order because G must be earlier than J.
  B: J must be third in both orders because G must be earlier than J, and Y must be after S.
  C: Q cannot be first in either order because S must be earlier than Q if Q is not third.
  D: Q must be third in both orders because S must be earlier than Q, and Y must be after S.

  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be Q, R, and S. 
  Since J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, the order of the last three articles must be J, G, and R. 
  Therefore, the order of the articles is Q, R, S, Y, J, G, and R.
  A: J cannot be second because Q, R, and S must be the first three articles.
  B: J must be earlier than G, so J cannot be third.
  C: Q, R, and S must be the first three articles, so Q cannot be first.
  D: Q, R, and S must be the first three articles, so Q cannot be third.
  E: R cannot be seventh because it is the last article to be edited.

  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  The mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, option B cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1.
Response 2:

  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
  A: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2. The horror film is shown on a different screen than the mystery, so it cannot be shown on screen 1. Therefore, this is not a possible list of movies for screen 1.
  B: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be shown on screen 2. Therefore, this is a possible list of movies for screen 1.
  C: The western must be shown on screen 1 or 2 and must begin before the horror film. The horror film cannot be shown on screen 1, so it must be shown on screen 2. Therefore, this is a possible list of movies for screen 1.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies showing at the theater: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  We need to determine which of the given options cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.
  From the given conditions, we know that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. This eliminates options B and D.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does. Therefore, the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. if the western is also shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. This eliminates option C.
  This leaves us with options A and E. Both of these options are possible, depending on the scheduling of the other movies.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  According to the given conditions, the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 with the sci-fi film, which eliminates choices A and B. The western begins at some time before the horror film does, which eliminates choice C. The romance is not shown on screen 2, which eliminates choice D. Therefore, the only option left is E, which can be a valid list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.
Response 6:

  - There are five movies showing at the repertory theater: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  - There are three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  - We need to determine which of the given options CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.
  - The western must be shown before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
  - The romance cannot be shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  - Option A is possible because the sci-fi film can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. followed by the horror film on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  - Option B is possible because the sci-fi film can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. followed by the mystery on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  - Option C is possible because the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. followed by the horror film on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  - Option D is possible because the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. followed by the mystery on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  - Option E is NOT possible because the western cannot be shown on screen 1 and the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3. Therefore, it is impossible to have the western and the sci-fi film shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies showing at the theater: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  Since screen 1 shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M., and the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, we know that one of the following pairs must be shown on screen 1: (western, sci-fi), (western, romance), (sci-fi, romance). 
  We also know that the western begins at some time before the horror film does, and the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. Therefore, the western and the horror film cannot both be shown on screen 1, and the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1. 
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate choices A, C, and E, leaving us with choices B and D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Elimination:
  We are asked to find a list that CANNOT be accurate for screen 1.
  A: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2. But the horror film is shown after the western, so it cannot be shown on screen 1. This list is possible.
  B: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so this list is possible.
  C: The western must be shown on either screen 1 or 2, but it cannot be shown on screen 2 because the romance is not shown on screen 2. Therefore, the western must be shown on screen 1. But the horror film is shown after the western, so it cannot be shown on screen 1. This list is not possible.
  D: The western must be shown on either screen 1 or 2, but it cannot be shown on screen 2 because the romance is not shown on screen 2. Therefore, the western must be shown on screen 1. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so this list is possible.
  E: The western must be shown on either screen 1 or 2, but it cannot be shown on screen 2 because the romance is not shown on screen 2. Therefore, the western must be shown on screen 1. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2. This list is possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that the western is shown before the horror film, and the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the western can only be shown on screen 1 or 2, and the horror film can only be shown on screen 2 or 3. Furthermore, the romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 3. Since the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, it must be shown on screen 1 or 2. Therefore, the possible combinations for screen 1 and 2 are: 
  - Screen 1: western and sci-fi; Screen 2: horror and mystery
  - Screen 1: western and horror; Screen 2: sci-fi and mystery
  - Screen 1: western and mystery; Screen 2: sci-fi and horror
  The combination of western and romance can only be shown on screen 3. Therefore, the following cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first:

Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there would be no sales representative left to work in Zone 2, which is not possible.
  - If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, it is possible since we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, it is possible since we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, it is possible since we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, it is not possible since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.

  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there is only one sales representative left to work in Zone 2, which contradicts the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, A is true and cannot be false.
  - If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there are only two sales representatives left to work in Zone 1, which contradicts the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. So, B is true and cannot be false.
  - If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, it is possible because there can be more than two sales representatives in Zone 3. So, C is not necessarily false.
  - If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, it is possible because there can be more than two sales representatives in Zone 3. So, D is not necessarily false.
  - If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, it is possible because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. So, E is not necessarily false.

  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there would be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 2 and three sales representatives left to work in Zone 3. This is not possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, A is false.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there would be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 2 and two sales representatives left to work in Zone 1. This is not possible because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, B is false.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there would be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 2 and two sales representatives left to work in Zone 1. This is possible because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, C is not necessarily false.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there would be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 2 and two sales representatives left to work in Zone 1. This is possible because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, D is not necessarily false.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there would be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 2 and three sales representatives left to work in Zone 3. This is not possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, E is false.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies.
- Each breed of kitten and puppy is featured exactly once on each day of the seven consecutive days.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Since there are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies, there are 9 possible breed combinations.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so any breed that is featured on the same day as Greyhounds can only be featured on days 1, 4, and 7.
- Any breed featured on day 1 cannot be featured on day 2, so the only breed that can be featured on day 2 is one of the breeds that was not featured on day 1.
- Any breed that is featured on day 7 can only be featured on days 4, 5, and 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Therefore, Himalayans can be featured on days 2, 4, 5, 6, and cannot be featured on days 1, 3, 7.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers can be featured on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and cannot be featured on day 3 or 7.

  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, then one breed must be featured on only one day. However, each breed of kitten and puppy is featured exactly once on each of the seven days. Therefore, this cannot be true.
B: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Himalayans would be featured on day 1, which is not possible. Therefore, this cannot be true.
C: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans would be featured on day 1, which is not possible. Therefore, this cannot be true.
D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans would be featured on day 7, which is not possible. Therefore, this cannot be true.
E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers would be featured on day 1, which is true. Also, since Himalayans are not featured on day 1, Rottweilers are not featured on day 2. Furthermore, since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, Rottweilers are not featured on day 3, 4, or 5. Finally, since Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, Rottweilers must be featured on day 6. Therefore, this could be true.

Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, and the voicemail targets for Solide and Truvest must be either 1 day or 2 days. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Solide's website target must be 2 days, and Truvest's website target must be 1 day. Therefore, the only option that is not necessarily true is A: Image's website target is 1 day.

- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the maximum voicemail target is 2 days. 
Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target is 1 day. 
Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and the maximum website target is 3 days, Solide's website target is 2 days and Truvest's website target is 3 days. 
Therefore, the only option that is not necessarily true is A: Image's website target is 1 day. It could be 2 or 3 days, depending on the targets for the other clients.
Response 3:

  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")
Explanation: 
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be either 1 day or 2 days. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, it cannot be 2 days. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, and since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must also be 1 day. This means that option A is true, and it cannot be the answer. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so option D is true. Solide's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days, so option C can be true. Truvest's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days, so option E can be true. Therefore, the only option that cannot be true is A.

- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be either 1 day or 2 days. If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then Solide's and Truvest's voicemail targets must also be 2 days, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must also be 1 day. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is 2 days and Truvest's website target is 3 days. Therefore, the only statement that is not necessarily true is A: Image's website target is 1 day. It could be 2 days if Image's voicemail target is 2 days. The other statements are all true based on the given conditions.

  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.

Truvest's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must be 1 day. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days.

  A: Image's website target can be 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days. This statement may or may not be true, so it is not necessarily false.
  B: Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target is 2 days. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day. This statement is true.

  - The service targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("A") 

If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then it means that the voicemail target for each client is either 1 day, or 2 days. This also means that the website target for each client is either 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days. 

Option A states that Image's website target is 1 day. This could be true, since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and we don't know what Image's voicemail target is. Therefore, option A could be true and is not necessarily false. 

Option B states that Solide's website target is 2 days. This could be true, since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and we don't know what Truvest's website target is. Therefore, option B could be true and is not necessarily false.

Option C states that Solide's voicemail target is 2 days. This could be true, since the voicemail target for each client is either 1 day or 2 days, and we don't know what Solide's voicemail target is. Therefore, option C could be true and is not necessarily false.

Option D states that Truvest's website target is 2 days. This could be true, since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and we don't know what Solide's website target is. Therefore, option D could be true and is not necessarily false.

Option E states that Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days. This could be true, since the voicemail target for each client is either 1 day or 2 days, and we don't know what Truvest's voicemail target is. Therefore, option E could be true and is not necessarily false.

Therefore, the only option that is not necessarily true is option A, so the answer is A.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  
Analysis:
  - If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
  - Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  - If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day.
  - If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day.
  - Therefore, either Solide's website target is 1 day and Truvest's website target is 2 days, or vice versa.
  - This means that options B, D, and E must be true.

  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days. 
  From the conditions, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target is 2 days and Truvest's website target is 3 days. 
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target is 1 day and Solide and Truvest's voicemail targets are 2 days. 
  The only statement that is not necessarily true is C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days. It could be 1 day.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Each client has two targets: one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("C")

If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, it means that the longest voicemail target is 2 days. This means that Solide's voicemail target cannot be 3 days, so it must be 2 days. Therefore, Solide's website target must be shorter than 2 days, which means it must be 1 day. Truvest's website target must be longer than Solide's website target, so it must be 2 days. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so it must be 1 day. This leaves us with Truvest's voicemail target, which can be either 1 day or 2 days. Therefore, the statement "Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days" may or may not be true, depending on the specific target chosen. Therefore, the answer is (E) Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- There will be six different photographs in total, exactly two photographs per section in Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
- There are no Gagnon's photographs in the Sports section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.

Analysis:
- Option A is not possible because if both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there will be more than three photographs by Fuentes in total, which violates the condition that no more than three photographs by a photographer can appear.
- Option B is not possible because there are only three photographers, and if both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then there will be no photographs by Fuentes or Hue in the Metro section, which violates the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- Option C is possible because one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue, and there is no restriction on the number of Hue's photographs in the Metro section.
- Option D is not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and we already know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes.
- Option E is possible because there is no restriction on the number of photographs by Hue or any other photographer in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
- There will be six photographs in total, with exactly two photographs per section.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
- The other photograph in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Fuentes or Hue.
- At least one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
- The other photograph in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes or Hue.
- The photographs in the Sports section must include one by Fuentes and one by Hue.

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. (Not possible since at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by Hue or Fuentes)
B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. (Not possible since at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by Hue or Fuentes)
C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. (Possible since at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by Hue or Fuentes)
D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. (Not possible since the photographs in the Sports section must include one by Fuentes and one by Hue)
E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. (Not possible since the photographs in the Sports section must include one by Fuentes and one by Hue)

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Six photographs will appear in three different sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
- Two photographs will appear in each section.
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photographs appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: 
- If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - The remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be taken by either Fuentes or Hue.
  - At least one photograph in the Metro section must be taken by either Fuentes or Hue.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so the two photographs in the Sports section must be taken by Fuentes and Hue.
  - Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which means that one of the two photographs in the Metro section must be taken by Hue.
  - Thus, the only option that could be true is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  
Answer: C
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then it means that there are no photographs by Gagnon in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and that photographer can only be Fuentes or Hue. If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then Fuentes will have three photographs in total, which is not allowed. If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then there will be no photographs by Fuentes or Hue in the Metro section, which is also not allowed. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, which means that the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Gagnon. In the Sports section, the number of Hue's photographs must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs, which means that there can be at most one photograph by Hue in the Sports section. Therefore, both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue, which eliminates choice (D). Finally, since Fuentes has one photograph in the Lifestyle section and one photograph in the Sports section, Fuentes can have at most one photograph in the Metro section, which eliminates choice (A). Therefore, the answer is (C), exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Six different photographs will appear, exactly two photographs per section, in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper.
- The available photographs were taken by Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- At least one but no more than three of each photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This satisfies the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of the other choices can be true based on the given conditions.
Response 5:

  - There are 6 photographs in total: 2 in Lifestyle, 2 in Metro, and 2 in Sports.
  - There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer can have between 1 and 3 photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - There is no information about the third photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - There is no information about the photographs in the Sports section.
  - There is no information about the photographs in the Metro section, except that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.

Analysis:
  - A cannot be true because if both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there would be no photograph by Hue in the Metro section, which contradicts the given information.
  - B cannot be true because none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, which means that Gagnon can have at most 2 photographs in total, and therefore cannot have 2 photographs in the Metro section.
  - C could be true because there is no information about the second photograph in the Metro section, and it is possible that it is by Hue.
  - D cannot be true because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and we already know that there is one photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section.
  - E could be true because there is no information about the photographs in the Sports section.

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. 
  - This is not possible because Fuentes already has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, so he can have at most two more photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, he cannot have both photographs in the Metro section.
  
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  - This is possible because Gagnon has not been assigned any restrictions yet.
  
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  - This is possible because Hue has not been assigned any restrictions yet.
  
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  - This is not possible because Fuentes must have at least one more photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, he cannot have zero photographs in the Sports section.
  
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  - This is possible because Fuentes must have at least one more photograph in the Sports section and Gagnon has not been assigned any restrictions yet.

  - The remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be taken by either Fuentes or Hue.
  - The photographs in the Metro section must be taken by the remaining photographer and one of the other two photographers.
  - The photographs in the Sports section must be taken by the remaining two photographers.
  - Since Fuentes has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, he cannot have more than two photographs in the Sports section.
  - Since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, he must have two photographs in the Metro section.
  
Analysis:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This is not possible since Fuentes already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. This is not possible since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is possible since Hue has a photograph in the Lifestyle section and there are only two photographers left for the Metro section.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is not possible since Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Sports section.

  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  From the given information, we know that bay 5 holds fuel and bay 3 holds textiles. We also know that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so bay 2 must hold livestock and bay 1 must hold grain. Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are completely determined, which is a total of 5 bays. The type of cargo for bay 6 is not determined. Therefore, the answer is B: three.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be bay 3 or bay 5.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so the bay holding produce must be bay 5 or bay 6.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so the bay holding livestock must be bay 1, bay 2, or bay 3.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain must be bay 4, bay 5, or bay 6.
  Therefore, the only unknown bay is the bay holding machinery, which must be bay 1, bay 2, or bay 3.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Bay numbers and cargo types are related in a specific way.
  Bay 1 is on one side of the dock and Bay 6 is on the other side.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Solution:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be in bay 3. 
  Therefore, the bay holding livestock must be in bay 2 and the bay holding grain must be in bay 1.
  The bay holding fuel must be in bay 5 and the bay holding machinery must be in bay 6.
  Therefore, the type of cargo for all six bays is completely determined.
Action: Answer("E")

  There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
Action: Answer("C")  
If bay 4 is holding produce, then bay 5 must be holding textiles and bay 3 must be holding fuel. Bay 1 must be holding livestock and bay 2 must be holding grain. Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is completely determined, which is a total of 4 bays.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so the bay holding fuel must be either bay 1 or bay 2.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so the bay holding livestock must be either bay 2 or bay 3.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain must be either bay 4, 5, or 6.
  Therefore, the only undetermined bay is the one holding machinery, which must be either bay 1 or bay 6.

  - There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  
Solution: 
  From the given information, we can deduce the following order of bays from left to right:
  Fuel, Textiles, Produce, Livestock, Grain, Machinery
  Since Bay 4 is holding produce, we know that Bay 5 is holding fuel and Bay 3 is holding textiles. 
  From the given information, we know that the bay holding livestock is Bay 2 and the bay holding grain is Bay 6. 
  Therefore, the type of cargo for Bays 1 and 4 are completely determined. 
  Answer: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce. 
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are six bays and each bay is holding a different type of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  
Solution:
  From the given information, we know that bay 5 must be holding fuel and bay 3 must be holding textiles. 
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so bay 2 must be holding livestock and bay 1 must be holding grain.
  Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are completely determined.
  Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles—each held in a different bay numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  We know that bay 4 is holding produce, and that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, the bay holding fuel must be one of bays 1, 2, or 3. We also know that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding textiles must be one of bays 3, 4, or 5. We also know that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so the bay holding livestock must be one of bays 1 or 2, and the bay holding grain must be the other of those two bays. This means that the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are completely determined by the given information.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Bay numbers and cargo types are related by a set of rules.
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  There are six bays.
  There are six types of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
Action: Bay 4 is holding produce, which means that the bay holding fuel must be bay 1, since the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles must be bay 2, since it is next to the bay holding produce. The bay holding livestock must be bay 3, since the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding grain must be bay 5, since the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, the type of cargo that each bay is holding is completely determined for five of the six bays.

  - Option D satisfies all the conditions and is a possible selection of employees for the team.
  - Option E violates the condition that if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination:
  A: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. So, this option is not possible because Myers and Paine are both on the team.
  B: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. So, this option is not possible because Ortega and Paine are both on the team.
  C: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. So, this option is not possible because neither Myers nor Yoder is on the team.
  D: This option satisfies all the given conditions. Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson are on the team, and Yoder is on the team. So, this option is possible.
  E: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. So, this option is not possible because Wong is on the team but neither Myers nor Yoder is on the team.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
A: Myers and Paine are on the same team, which is not allowed. Schmidt is on the team, which would require both Paine and Thomson to be on the team. Therefore, A is not a possible selection.
B: Ortega and Paine are on the same team, which is not allowed. Schmidt is not on the team, which means there is no requirement for Paine and Thomson to be on the team. Therefore, B is a possible selection.
C: Schmidt is on the team, which would require both Paine and Thomson to be on the team. However, neither Myers nor Yoder are on the team, which would be required if Wong were on the team. Therefore, C is not a possible selection.
D: Schmidt is on the team, which would require both Paine and Thomson to be on the team. Wong is not on the team, which would be required if Myers were on the team. Therefore, D is not a possible selection.
E: Wong is on the team, which would require both Myers and Yoder to be on the team. Thomson is on the team, which would be required if Schmidt were on the team. Therefore, E is a possible selection.

Action: Answer("E")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then at most two sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then at most two sales representatives work in Zone 3. Therefore, either one or two sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, at least one of them works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, at least one of them works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone. Therefore, if Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn also works in Zone 3. This would mean that there are two sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the fact that at most two sales representatives work in Zone 3. Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Therefore, if Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey also works in Zone 3. This would mean that there are two sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the fact that at most two sales representatives work in Zone 3. Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 3.
  - If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 (because either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but not both). Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3. This means that there are two sales representatives in Zone 2 and one sales representative in Zone 1, which contradicts the fact that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 1.
  - If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1 (because either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but not both). Therefore, Parra works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3. This means that there are two sales representatives in Zone 2 and one sales representative in Zone 1, which satisfies the condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao could work in Zone 1.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
- There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- We are given that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.

Analysis:
- Since more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, it means that either 4 or 5 representatives work in Zone 1, and either 1 or 2 representatives work in Zone 3.
- From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. This means that at least one of Parra and Tiao works in Zone 1, and at least one of Tiao and Udall works in Zone 2.
- From the condition that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, we know that if Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn also works in Zone 1.
- From the condition that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, we know that if Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey also works in Zone 2.
- We are asked which one of the following could be true.

Solution:
- If Kim works in Zone 2, then there would be at most 1 representative in Zone 1 (either Parra or Tiao), at most 1 representative in Zone 2 (either Tiao or Udall), and at least 5 representatives in Zone 3. This contradicts the given condition that more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, A cannot be true.
- If Mahr works in Zone 2, then there would be at most 1 representative in Zone 1 (either Parra or Tiao), exactly 2 representatives in Zone 2 (Tiao and Udall), and at least 4 representatives in Zone 3. This satisfies the given condition that more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, B could be true.
- If Parra works in Zone 3, then there would be at most 1 representative in Zone 1 (either Tiao or Udall), at most 1 representative in Zone 2 (either Tiao or Udall), and at least 5 representatives in Zone 3. This contradicts the given condition that more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, C cannot be true.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then there would be exactly 1 representative in Zone 1 (Tiao), at most 1 representative in Zone 2 (Udall), and at least 5 representatives in Zone 3. This satisfies the given condition that more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, D could be true.
- If Udall works in Zone 3, then there would be at most 1 representative in Zone 1 (either Parra or Tiao), at most 1 representative in Zone 2 (either Tiao or Udall), and at least 5 representatives in Zone 3. This contradicts the given condition that more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 has at least 3 sales representatives.
  
Eliminating choices:
  - A: We don't know where Kim works.
  - B: We don't know where Mahr works.
  - C: If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 1, which means that Zone 1 has at least 2 sales representatives, and since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then Zone 3 must have at least 3 sales representatives, which means that there are at least 2+3=5 sales representatives, but we only have 7 sales representatives, so this choice is not possible.
  - D: If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3, which means that Zone 3 has at least 2 sales representatives, and since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then Zone 3 must have at least 3 sales representatives, which means that there are at least 2+3=5 sales representatives, but we only have 7 sales representatives, so this choice is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives in Zone 2 must be the smallest.
  - From the given conditions, we know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because there would be fewer sales representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3.
  - This eliminates option D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  - From the remaining options, the only one that is consistent with the given conditions is option E: Udall works in Zone 3.
  - Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Udall could work in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  We know that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We need to determine which option could be true if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  - Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, it follows that Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1.
  - Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, Quinn also works in Zone 1.
  - Since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, and Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, it follows that Udall works in Zone 2.
  - Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, Stuckey also works in Zone 2.
  - Therefore, there are two sales representatives in Zone 1 (Parra and Quinn), two sales representatives in Zone 2 (Stuckey and Udall), and three sales representatives in Zone 3 (Kim, Mahr, and Tiao).
  - Based on this analysis, we can eliminate options A and B because neither Kim nor Mahr can work in Zone 2.
  - Option C is also incorrect because Parra works in Zone 1.
  - Option D is correct because Tiao works in Zone 1.
  - Option E is incorrect because Udall works in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are exactly 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  - There are only two sales representatives who can work in Zone 1: Parra or Tiao.
  - There are only two sales representatives who can work in Zone 2: Tiao or Udall.
  - If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra must work in Zone 3 and there would be only one sales representative in Zone 1, which contradicts the given condition.
  - Therefore, Parra must work in Zone 1 and Tiao must work in Zone 2.
  - Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, Quinn must also work in Zone 1.
  - Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, they cannot both work in Zone 2, so they must both work in Zone 3.
  - Therefore, there are 3 sales representatives in Zone 3 and 2 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives.
  The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: 
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 3, because if Tiao worked in Zone 3, then Parra would have to work in Zone 1, which would mean that there would be more sales representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2. If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn must work in Zone 1, and there would be at most one other sales representative working in Zone 1. This means that there would be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3. Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, and there are at most two sales representatives working in Zone 2, it follows that Udall must work in Zone 3. Therefore, the only option that could be true is E: Udall works in Zone 3. Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  - If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, which means there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2. This contradicts the fact that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  - If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well, which means there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1. This contradicts the fact that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 3.
  - If Kim or Mahr works in Zone 2, then there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, which contradicts the fact that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, neither Kim nor Mahr can work in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives in Zone 2 is either 1 or 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives in Zone 3 is either 2 or 1.
  - If there are 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, then there must be 1 sales representative in Zone 2 and 4 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  - If there is 1 sales representative in Zone 3, then there must be 1 or 2 sales representatives in Zone 2 and 5 or 4 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  - From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Udall or Parra works in Zone 2.
  - If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must also work in Zone 3. This means that there are at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  - If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 2. This means that there are 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: If Mahr works in Zone 2, then there are 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, which means there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3. This is consistent with the given conditions, and therefore, it could be true.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 (but not both).
- Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2 (but not both).
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 3 or 4 sales representatives in Zone 1.

Analysis:
- If Kim works in Zone 2, then neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 1, which contradicts the given conditions. Eliminate A.
- If Mahr works in Zone 2, then neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 2, which contradicts the given conditions. Eliminate B.
- If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1 and Udall must work in Zone 2. This means that there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, which contradicts the given condition that there are either 3 or 4 sales representatives in Zone 1. Eliminate C.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 3. This means that there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Eliminate D.
- If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well. This means that Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 2, and Tiao and Kim must work in Zone 1. This satisfies all the given conditions, and there are 3 sales representatives in Zone 1, 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, and 2 sales representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, the answer is E.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.

  5. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  6. Theresa tests J on the first day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. We know that Theresa tests J on the first day, and each bicycle must be tested on both days. Therefore, J cannot be tested on the second day by Reynaldo, and this choice is not possible.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki must test F on the first day and Seamus must test G on the first day. Then, Seamus must test H on the second day, and Reynaldo must test J on the second day. Therefore, this choice is possible.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki must test F on the first day and Seamus must test G on the first day. Then, Seamus must test H on the second day, and Reynaldo must test J on the second day. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki must test F on the first day and Seamus must test G on the first day. Then, Seamus must test H on the second day, and Reynaldo must test J on the second day. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki must test F on the first day and Seamus must test G on the first day. Then, Seamus must test H on the second day, and Reynaldo must test J on the second day. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day.
  
Analysis:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day. Therefore, Yuki must test either F, G, or H on the first day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the second day. Therefore, Seamus must test either F, G, or H on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day. Therefore, Reynaldo must test either F, H, or J on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki tests either F, G, or H on the first day. If Yuki tests H on the first day, then Theresa tests F on the second day, Seamus tests J on the second day, and Reynaldo tests G on the second day. Therefore, Yuki could test H on the second day.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J.
  Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. 
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be H and the bicycle that Seamus tests on the second day must be J.
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. It is not possible because Reynaldo cannot test F, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day. It is not possible because Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day. It is possible because Yuki must test H on the first day, and each rider tests only one bicycle per day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. It is not possible because the bicycle that Seamus tests on the second day must be J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. It is not possible because Theresa tests J on the first day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  - Four bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider will test one of the bicycles on the first day and a different one on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - Yuki tests a bike on the first day that Seamus tests on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the second day.
  
Analysis:
  - Theresa tests J on the first day, so Seamus cannot test J on the second day.
  - Yuki cannot test J, so Seamus must test J on the first day.
  - Yuki tests a bike on the first day that Seamus tests on the second day, so Yuki must test F on the first day.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so Reynaldo must test G on the first day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo must test H on the second day.
  - Seamus tests H on the second day, so (A) is not possible.
  - Seamus tests J on the first day, so (D) is not possible.
  - Yuki tests H on the second day, so (C) is possible.
  - Theresa tests J on the first day, so (E) is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  5. Each rider will test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  6. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  
If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the second day. Thus, J cannot be tested by Reynaldo or Yuki on the second day. Since Theresa must be one of the testers for H, H must be tested by either Reynaldo or Yuki on the second day. Seamus cannot test H on the first day because he must test J on the first day. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Yuki tests H on the second day. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  5. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  6. Theresa tests J on the first day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. (This could be true. Reynaldo cannot test F, but he can test G, and he has not tested G yet.)
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day. (This cannot be true. Theresa must be one of the testers for H, and she is testing J.)
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day. (This cannot be true. Yuki cannot test J, and she has not tested H yet.)
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. (This could be true. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, and Yuki cannot test J. Therefore, Seamus must test J on the second day.)
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. (This cannot be true. Theresa is testing J on the first day.)

Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia

  E: Robert, George, and Helen
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left to give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  
  We need to determine the three students who will give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, given that Kyle and Lenore will not give reports.
  
  A: Helen, George, and Nina - If this were the case, then Irving, Olivia, and Robert would give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively. However, this is not possible because Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen - If this were the case, then Nina, George, and Olivia would give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively. However, this is not possible because George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia - If this were the case, then George, Irving, and Robert would give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively. This is possible because George can only give a report on Tuesday, and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - If this were the case, then George, Helen, and Nina would give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively. However, this is not possible because Nina's report would have to be on Wednesday, which would mean that Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Tuesday, which is not allowed.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen - If this were the case, then Nina, Irving, and Olivia would give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively. However, this is not possible because George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("C") - The morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Nina, Helen, and Olivia.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 students in the seminar who will give oral reports on 3 consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday).
  - Exactly 2 reports will be given each day (1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon).
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are 6 students left to give reports.
  
  Possible morning reports on Monday:
  - Kyle and Lenore cannot give reports
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday
  - If Nina does not give a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Tuesday
  - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday
  - If George does not give a report on Tuesday, then Nina can give a report on Wednesday
  
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
    - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which means neither of them can give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday, which contradicts the given conditions. Incorrect.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
    - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which means neither of them can give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday, which contradicts the given conditions. Incorrect.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
    - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which means neither of them can give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday, which contradicts the given conditions. Incorrect.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
    - Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so he must give a morning report. 
    - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which means neither of them can give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday, which contradicts the given conditions. Incorrect.
    - If Nina does not give a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina can give a report on Wednesday. 
    - This means that the morning reports on Wednesday could be given by Kyle and Lenore, who have not given reports yet. 
    - Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Olivia, Robert, and Irving. 
    - This satisfies all the given conditions and is a possible scenario. 
    - Correct. 
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
    - George can only give a report on Tuesday, so this is not possible. Incorrect.

- Therefore, the answer is A: Helen, George, and Nina. 

Answer: A
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The seminar has eight students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Solution:
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who will give reports are: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Since Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, he must give a report on Tuesday, and it must be in the morning.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give their reports in the morning.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. So, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, and they must be in the morning. If Nina's report is given on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give their reports on Monday, and they can be in the morning.
  So, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina (incorrect, because George's report must be on Tuesday)
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen (incorrect, because Robert cannot give a report in the afternoon)
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia (incorrect, because Nina's report cannot be on Tuesday, and Olivia cannot give a report in the afternoon)
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving (incorrect, because Robert cannot give a report in the afternoon)
  E: Robert, George, and Helen (correct, because George's report must be on Tuesday in the morning, and Robert and Helen can give their reports on Monday in the morning) 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Exactly 6 students will give reports, 2 reports per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- George can only give a report on Tuesday.
- Olivia and Robert can't give afternoon reports.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.

Action: 
- Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, there are only six students left to give reports.
- We know that George must give his report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
- We also know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give their reports in the morning.
- If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, except if Nina's report is on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday.
- Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, they cannot give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
- Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
  - A: Helen, George, and Nina (not possible since Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday)
  - B: Irving, Robert, and Helen (not possible since Robert cannot give an afternoon report)
  - C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia (not possible since Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday)
  - D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving (possible since Olivia and Robert can give morning reports, and Irving can give an afternoon report)
  - E: Robert, George, and Helen (not possible since George must give his report on Tuesday)

Therefore, the answer is D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  We need to determine which students can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, given that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Solution:
  Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we know that they cannot give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We also know that George cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday, so he must give a report on Tuesday. 
  We also know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports. 
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
  Therefore, we know that Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, otherwise Helen and Irving would both have to give reports on Wednesday. 
  So, Nina must give a report on Monday or Wednesday. 
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert must both give reports on Wednesday. 
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert must both give reports on Tuesday. 
  Thus, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina (not possible since George must give a report on Tuesday)
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen (not possible since Helen and Irving cannot give reports on the same day)
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia (not possible since Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday)
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving (possible if Nina gives a report on Wednesday)
  E: Robert, George, and Helen (not possible since George must give a report on Tuesday)
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  * Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days.
  * Two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  * Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  * Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  * If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  * Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
Solution:
  * Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the students giving reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  * Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  * Since Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, they must give morning reports.
  * If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Thus, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, otherwise, Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, which is not possible since only two reports can be given on Wednesday.
  * Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  * Since George cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday, he must give a report on Tuesday.
  * Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the remaining students giving reports are Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  * Since Nina is giving a report on Wednesday, Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday.
  * Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Answer("B") Irving, Robert, and Helen.

Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If I is placed on the middle shelf, we know that the top shelf must have at least 2 books and the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  - If F is placed on the same shelf as M, then they cannot be on the top shelf because the top shelf has at least 2 books.
  - If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K and F cannot be on the same shelf. K must be on the middle or top shelf, and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - None of the conditions give us information about the placement of G or H.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on the other shelf with L and O. We also know that K and G must be on the remaining shelf. However, we don't know which shelf is which, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where any of the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must be on the same shelf, and O must be on the bottom shelf. We also know that I must be on the remaining shelf with K and G. Therefore, it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where any of the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where any of the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
  A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F, G, H, K, L, and O are placed. So, this is not enough to determine which shelf each book is placed on.
  B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F, H, I, L, M, and O are placed. So, this is not enough to determine which shelf each book is placed on.
  C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M is also on the same shelf as F, and we know that K, I, and O are not on the same shelf as F, so we can determine the placement of all the books. Therefore, this is enough to determine which shelf each book is placed on.
  D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F, G, I, K, L, and O are placed. So, this is not enough to determine which shelf each book is placed on.
  E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F, G, I, K, L, and M are placed. So, this is not enough to determine which shelf each book is placed on.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F is located, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F, L, M, and O are located, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M is also on the same shelf, because F and M are on the same shelf. We also know that K, I, and O are not on the same shelf as L and F, because K is on a higher shelf than F, I is on the middle shelf, and O is on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, the only option left for K, I, and O is to be on the remaining shelf, which is the top shelf. This means that L and F are on the bottom shelf, and M is on the middle shelf. So, if L and F are placed on the same shelf, it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F and L are located, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F, G, I, K, and L are located, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The bookcase has exactly three shelves.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  
Analysis:
  If I is placed on the middle shelf, and at least two books are placed on each shelf, then the top shelf cannot have more books than the middle shelf. Therefore, the bottom shelf must have the most books, and the top shelf must have the least books. 
  If F and M are placed on the same shelf, then they cannot be placed on the top shelf, since the top shelf has fewer books than the other shelves. Therefore, F and M must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be placed on the middle or bottom shelf if F is placed on the top shelf. Therefore, F must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, and K must be placed on the top shelf.
  If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be placed on the middle or bottom shelf if L is placed on the top shelf. Therefore, L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, and O must be placed on the top shelf.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf must have at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If I is on the middle shelf, then the top shelf must have at least two books, and the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  - If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf, and F cannot be on the top shelf.
  - If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf, and L cannot be on the top shelf.
  - If F is on the same shelf as M, then both F and M must be on the same shelf, and that shelf cannot be the top shelf.
  - If any two books are placed on the same shelf, then the placement of the other six books can be determined using the given conditions.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
  - I is on the middle shelf
  - K is on a higher shelf than F
  - O is on a higher shelf than L
  - F is on the same shelf as M
Action: Answer("A") 

If I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, then F must be on a different shelf from I and M. Since F is on the same shelf as M, it follows that I and M must be on the same shelf as F, leaving K, G, H, and O to be placed on the remaining shelf or shelves. The placement of K, G, H, and O can be determined based on the given conditions, so it is fully determined which shelf each book is placed on. Therefore, the answer is A.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on a different shelf than I and M since F is on the same shelf as M. We also know that K and O must be on the bottom shelf since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf and K and O are the only two books left. However, we cannot determine where the remaining books (F, G, H, and L) are placed. Therefore, A is not fully determined.

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K and F must be on different shelves. We also know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so O and L must be on different shelves. Since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we can deduce that K and G are on the top shelf, I and O are on the middle shelf, and the remaining books (F, H, and L) are on the bottom shelf. Therefore, B is fully determined.

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that F is on the same shelf as M, so L must be on a different shelf than F and M. We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K and L must be on different shelves. However, we cannot determine where the remaining books (G, H, I, and O) are placed. Therefore, C is not fully determined.

D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on a different shelf than M and H since F is on the same shelf as M. We also know that K and O must be on the bottom shelf since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf and K and O are the only two books left. However, we cannot determine where the remaining books (F, G, H, I, and L) are placed. Therefore, D is not fully determined.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that K and O must be on the bottom shelf since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf and K and O are the only two books left. We also know that I is on the middle shelf, so I and H must be on the top shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, we can deduce that F and G are on the middle shelf and the remaining book (L) is on the bottom shelf. Therefore, E is fully determined.

  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  - If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we know that F is on the remaining shelf, and we can use the other conditions to determine which shelf each book is on. Therefore, A is a possible answer.
  - If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine which shelf each book is on. For example, K and G could be on the middle shelf, and the remaining books could be on the top and bottom shelves. Therefore, B is not a possible answer.
  - If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine which shelf each book is on. For example, L and F could be on the middle shelf, and the remaining books could be on the top and bottom shelves. Therefore, C is not a possible answer.

  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  - If I is placed on the middle shelf, then the top shelf must have at least 2 books, and the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  - If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf, and F cannot be on the top shelf.
  - If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf, and L cannot be on the top shelf.
  - If F is placed on the same shelf as M, then there are only two possibilities: either F and M are both on the top shelf, or they are both on the middle shelf.

Solution:
  - Option A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, we cannot determine the placement of any other book. Incorrect.
  - Option B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other, we cannot determine the placement of any other book. Incorrect.
  - Option C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, we know that F and M are also on that shelf, and there are only two possibilities: either F, M, and L are on the top shelf, or they are on the middle shelf. However, we cannot determine the placement of any other book. Incorrect.
  - Option D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other, we cannot determine the placement of any other book. Incorrect.
  - Option E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other, we know that O is not on the bottom shelf, and H is not on the top shelf. Therefore, H and O must be on the middle shelf, and the remaining 6 books must be on the top and bottom shelves. Since F and M are on the same shelf, and K is on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf, and F and M must be on the bottom shelf. This leaves G, I, and L to be placed on the remaining shelf, which is the top shelf. Therefore, the placement of all the books is fully determined if H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other. Correct.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.

  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. (No information is given about Reynaldo testing H on the first day. This option is not necessarily true.)
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. (Reynaldo cannot test F, and Yuki cannot test J. Therefore, Reynaldo must test either H or G on the first day. If Reynaldo tests G, then Yuki must test J on the first day, but Seamus cannot test G on the second day. Therefore, Reynaldo must test J on the first day.)
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day. (Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, Theresa must test H on either the first or second day. If Theresa tests H on the first day, then Yuki must test J on the first day, but Seamus cannot test H on the second day. Therefore, Theresa tests G on the first day and H on the second day.)
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. (Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, Theresa cannot test J on the first day.)
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day. (Yuki cannot test J. Therefore, Yuki must test H on either the first or second day. If Yuki tests H on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the first day, but Yuki cannot test H on the second day. Therefore, Yuki tests G on the first day and H on the second day.)

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Theresa must be one of the testers for H, then she cannot test F or J on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day.
  - Therefore, Theresa must test H on the first day.
  - Yuki cannot test J, so he must test F on the first day.
  - Seamus will test J on the first day.
  - Reynaldo will test G on the first day.
  - On the second day, Seamus will test Yuki's bicycle from the first day, which is F. Therefore, Seamus will test F on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test H, so he will test J on the second day.
  - Theresa will test G on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  - There are four bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider tests one bicycle on the first day and a different one on the second day.
  - All four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then:
  - Theresa cannot test G on the first day.
  - Theresa must test H on the first day.
  - Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so Yuki tests F on the first day.
  - Seamus tests J on the first day.
  - Reynaldo tests G on the first day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. False, Reynaldo tests G on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. True, Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day. False, Theresa tests G on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. False, Theresa tests H on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day. False, Yuki tests J on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

If Theresa tests G on the second day, then on the first day she must test either F, H, or J. 
- If she tests F, then Reynaldo cannot test on the first day because he cannot test F. Therefore, Reynaldo must test H or J on the first day. But if Reynaldo tests H on the first day, then Yuki cannot test H on the second day. So, Reynaldo must test J on the first day. But this contradicts the fact that Yuki cannot test J. Therefore, Theresa cannot test F on the first day.
- If Theresa tests H on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test on the first day because he cannot test F, and he cannot test H because Theresa is testing H. Therefore, Reynaldo must test J on the first day. Then, Yuki must test F on the first day, and Seamus must test G on the first day. On the second day, Reynaldo must test H, Yuki cannot test H, and Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day, which is F. Therefore, Theresa tests G on the second day.
- If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test on the first day because he cannot test F, and he cannot test J because Yuki is testing J. Therefore, Reynaldo must test H on the first day. Then, Yuki must test F on the first day, and Seamus must test G on the first day. On the second day, Reynaldo must test J, Yuki cannot test H, and Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day, which is J. Therefore, Theresa cannot test G on the second day.

Therefore, the only option that must be true is:
Action: Answer("D") Theresa tests J on the first day.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider will test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test G on the first day.
  - Therefore, Theresa must test either F, H, or J on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests H on the first day, then Yuki must test J on the first day and Seamus must test H on the second day.
  - If Reynaldo tests J on the first day, then he cannot test G on the second day.
  - Therefore, Reynaldo must test either F, H, or J on the first day.
  - If Reynaldo tests H on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the first day and Yuki must test H on the second day.
  - If Reynaldo tests F on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the first day and Yuki must test G on the second day.
  - Therefore, if Theresa tests G on the second day, then Reynaldo must test H on the first day.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:

  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo cannot test F, so he cannot test H on the first day. Incorrect.
  B: Reynaldo cannot test F, and Yuki cannot test J. This means Reynaldo must test J on the first day. Incorrect.
  C: Theresa must test H on one of the two days, but not necessarily on the second day. Incorrect.
  D: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day. Therefore, Theresa must test H on the first day. Correct.
  E: Yuki cannot test J, and if Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day. Therefore, Yuki must test H on the second day. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:

  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. We don't know if this is true or not based on the given information.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. We don't know if this is true or not based on the given information.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day. This cannot be true because we know that Theresa tests G on the second day, and Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so she must test H on the first day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. This cannot be true because we know that Yuki cannot test J, and each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day. This must be true because we know that Theresa tests G on the second day, and Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, Yuki must test H on the first day, and Seamus must test G on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider will test a different bicycle on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test G on the first day.
  
Solution:
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test G on the first day. Therefore, Reynaldo, Seamus, and Yuki will test F, H, and J on the first day.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, Theresa tests H on the first day.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, Seamus tests G on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F. Therefore, Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  
Analysis:
  - Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she tests H on the first day.
  - Therefore, the answer is C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

If Theresa tests G on the second day, then we know that she must test H on the first day. This means that Yuki will test J on the first day and Seamus will test F on the first day. 

Therefore, Reynaldo must test G on the first day because he cannot test F. This also means that Yuki will test H on the second day because she cannot test J. 

So the answer is: 
Action: Answer("B") Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. There are no restrictions on Reynaldo testing H on the first day, but we don't know if this is true or not based on the given information. 
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test either H or J on the first day. If Theresa is testing G on the second day, then H must be tested by Yuki or Seamus on the second day. If Yuki tests H on the second day, then Seamus must test J on the first day, which means that Reynaldo must test F on the first day. Therefore, Reynaldo cannot test J on the first day. 
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day. We know that Theresa must test H, but we don't know if it's on the first or second day. 
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo must test F on the first day, which is not possible. Therefore, Theresa cannot test J on the first day. 
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day. If Theresa is testing G on the second day, then H must be tested by Yuki or Seamus on the second day. If Seamus tests H on the second day, then Yuki must test J on the first day, which means that Reynaldo must test F on the first day. Therefore, Yuki must test H on the second day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three of the articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three other articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  The remaining article covers wildlife: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be from the nutrition articles Q, R, and S; however, it is not clear what the order of those three articles would be. Therefore, the order of the articles is not fully determined if H is fourth.
  If H is sixth, then the first five articles must be G, Q, S, Y, and R; however, it is not clear what the order of the first three articles would be. Therefore, the order of the articles is not fully determined if H is sixth.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be from the finance articles G, H, and J; however, it is not clear what the order of those three articles would be. Therefore, the order of the articles is not fully determined if R is fourth.
  If R is seventh, then the first six articles must be G, J, H, Q, S, and Y. This satisfies all of the conditions, so the order of the articles is fully determined if R is seventh.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be from the nutrition articles Q, R, and S, and then G or J. However, it is not clear which of G or J would be edited fifth. Therefore, the order of the articles is not fully determined if Y is fifth.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:

  There are 7 articles: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: If H is fourth, then the order of the articles is not fully determined yet. We don't know where Q, R, S, and Y are, and we don't know if G or J is first.
B: If H is sixth, then we know that G, J, Q, R, and S are the first five articles. However, we don't know where Y is, and we don't know if G or J is first.
C: If R is fourth, then we know that S is first, followed by Q, H, R, and then G or J. However, we don't know where Y is, and we don't know if G or J is after R.
D: If R is seventh, then we know that S is first, followed by Q, H, G, J, and then R. However, we don't know where Y is.
E: If Y is fifth, then we know that S must be first, followed by Q, H, G, and then Y. However, we don't know if J or R is after Y.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 articles to edit, and they are divided into 3 finance, 3 nutrition, and 1 wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be nutrition, and the only way to satisfy the condition is to have Q, S, then R. The next three articles must be finance, and the only way to satisfy the condition is to have J, G, then H. The last article must be Y. Therefore, the order is determined.
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be finance, and the only way to satisfy the condition is to have J, G, then R. The next three articles must be nutrition, and the only way to satisfy the condition is to have Q, S, then H. The last article must be Y. Therefore, the order is determined.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be nutrition, and the only way to satisfy the condition is to have S, Q, then R. The next three articles must be finance, and the only way to satisfy the condition is to have J, G, then H. The last article must be Y. Therefore, the order is determined.
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be nutrition, and the only way to satisfy the condition is to have S, Q, then R. The next three articles must be finance, and the only way to satisfy the condition is to have J, G, then H. The sixth article must be Y. However, there are two options for the fourth and fifth articles, which are R and either Q or S. Therefore, the order is not determined.
  If Y is fifth, then the first three articles must be nutrition, and the only way to satisfy the condition is to have S, Q, then R. The next two articles must be wildlife and finance, and the only way to satisfy the condition is to have Y and either J or G. The last article must be H or G, depending on which one was not chosen before. Therefore, the order is not determined.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles is subject to certain conditions.
  Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles, which means that S must be the first article. However, we do not know the order of Q and R, so we cannot determine the order of the articles.
  If H is sixth, then the first five articles must be nutrition articles, which means that S must be the first article, and Q must be the third article. R must be the fifth article, which means that G must be the fourth article, and J must be the second article. Y must be the seventh article. Therefore, the order of the articles is fully determined if H is sixth.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be finance articles, and the fourth article must be G. However, we do not know the order of H and J, so we cannot determine the order of the articles.
  If R is seventh, then the first six articles must be finance and nutrition articles, and the seventh article must be Y. However, we do not know the order of the finance and nutrition articles, so we cannot determine the order of the articles.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be finance and nutrition articles, and the fifth article must be S. However, we do not know the order of Q and R, so we cannot determine the order of the articles.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:

  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the order of the articles is still undetermined because we do not know the order of the first three articles.
  If H is sixth, then the order of the articles is still undetermined because we do not know the order of the first five articles.
  If R is fourth, then the order of the articles is fully determined as follows: S, Q, R, G, J, H, Y.
  If R is seventh, then the order of the articles is still undetermined because we do not know the order of the first six articles.
  If Y is fifth, then the order of the articles is still undetermined because we do not know the order of the first four articles.

  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, in that order. Then, the remaining articles must be edited in the order H, J, G, and Y. This satisfies all of the conditions, and the order is fully determined.
  
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, in that order. Then, the fourth article must be Y, and the fifth article must be one of G or J. However, since G must be earlier than R, the order is not fully determined.
  
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y, in that order. Then, the remaining articles must be edited in the order R, G, H, and J. This satisfies all of the conditions, and the order is fully determined.
  
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y, in that order. Then, the remaining articles must be edited in the order G, H, R, and J. This satisfies all of the conditions, and the order is fully determined.
  
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, R, and G or J (in either order). However, since S must be earlier than Y, this is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The articles are divided into three groups: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be from the nutrition group (Q, R, S), and the fourth must be from the wildlife group (Y). The remaining three articles must be from the finance group (G, H, J). However, we don't know the order of the finance group, so this is not enough to fully determine the order.
B: If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be from the nutrition group (Q, R, S), and the fourth, fifth, and sixth must be from the finance group (G, H, J). The last article must be from the wildlife group (Y). This satisfies all the conditions, so the order is fully determined.
C: If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be from the finance group (G, H, J), and the fourth must be from the nutrition group (Q, R, S). The remaining three articles must be from the wildlife group (Y). However, we don't know the order of the nutrition group, so this is not enough to fully determine the order.
D: If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be from the finance group (G, H, J), the next three must be from the nutrition group (Q, R, S), and the last one must be from the wildlife group (Y). However, we don't know the order of the finance group, so this is not enough to fully determine the order.
E: If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be from the finance and nutrition groups, and the fifth must be Y. This violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y, so this is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  To determine the order of the articles, we can start with the articles that have the most restrictions and work from there. We know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, the order must be JGR. We also know that S must be earlier than Y, so the order must be JGRS Y. This leaves two articles for the fourth and fifth positions: Q and H. We know that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third, so the order must be JGRSQH Y. This means that the order is fully determined if Q is third.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are seven articles to be edited.
  Three articles cover finance (G, H, J).
  Three articles cover nutrition (Q, R, S).
  One article covers wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then G must be first, J must be second, Y must be third, S must be fifth, Q must be sixth, and R must be seventh. This satisfies the conditions, so the order is fully determined. 
  If H is sixth, then Q must be third, which means S must be first or second. But S cannot be first because it must be earlier than Y. So S must be second, which means R must be first, G must be fourth, J must be fifth, Y must be seventh, and H must be sixth. This satisfies the conditions, so the order is fully determined.
  If R is fourth, then S must be first, Q must be third, and Y must be fifth. But G, H, and J cannot be second, fourth, and sixth, so this order is not fully determined.
  If R is seventh, then S must be first, Q must be third, Y must be fifth, and G, H, and J must be second, fourth, and sixth in some order. But this violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, so this order is not fully determined.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be first, Q must be third, and R must be seventh. But G, H, and J cannot be second, fourth, and sixth, so this order is not fully determined.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three of the articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three of the articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles, and the fourth article must be an article on finance. However, it is not clear what the order of the remaining articles should be, so this does not fully determine the order.
  If H is sixth, then the first five articles must be nutrition articles, and the sixth article must be an article on finance. However, it is not clear what the order of the remaining article should be, so this does not fully determine the order.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles, and the fourth article must be an article on finance. The fifth article must be S, and the sixth article must be Y. The last article must be G, so this fully determines the order.
  If R is seventh, then the last article must be R, and the sixth article must be an article on finance. However, it is not clear what the order of the remaining articles should be, so this does not fully determine the order.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be nutrition articles, and the fifth article must be S. However, it is not clear what the order of the remaining articles should be, so this does not fully determine the order.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
  - I is on the middle shelf
  - K is on a higher shelf than F
  - O is on a higher shelf than L
  - F is on the same shelf as M
  - If G is on the top shelf, then G is not on the middle or bottom shelf
  
Analysis:
  - If G is on the top shelf, then there are at least 2 books on the top shelf and at most 2 books on the middle shelf
  - I is on the middle shelf, so the list of books on the middle shelf must include I
  - F is on the same shelf as M, so if F is not on the top shelf, then both F and M are on the middle or bottom shelf
  - K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf if F is on the middle or bottom shelf
  - O is on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the middle shelf if L is on the middle shelf

Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  - If G is on the top shelf, then the list of books on the top shelf is {G, ...}
  - Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the list of books on the bottom shelf is {F, K, L, M, O}
  - I is on the middle shelf, so the list of books on the middle shelf is {H, I, ...}
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M and G is on the top shelf, then F and M must be on the middle shelf
  - Therefore, the list of books on the middle shelf is {H, I} and the answer is A.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Eight books are placed on three shelves.
  More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are three books on the top shelf.
  There must be at least two books on each shelf.
  
Analysis:
  If G is on the top shelf, then there are three books on the top shelf. 
  More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there are either four or five books on the bottom shelf.
  I is on the middle shelf, so there are either two or three books on the middle shelf.
  F and M are on the same shelf, but neither of them can be on the top shelf since G is already there. 
  K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the middle or top shelf.
  O is on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  
  If we assume that there are four books on the bottom shelf, then there are two books on the middle shelf. 
  Since I is on the middle shelf, the only other book that can be on the middle shelf is either K or L. 
  But K must be on the middle or top shelf, so L must be on the bottom shelf. 
  This means that H and G must be on the top shelf, but this violates the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. 
  Therefore, there must be five books on the bottom shelf and two books on the middle shelf. 
  Since I is on the middle shelf, the only other book that can be on the middle shelf is either K or L. 
  But K must be on the middle or top shelf, so L must be on the bottom shelf. 
  This means that H and G must be on the top shelf, and the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is I and K.
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly eight books are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.

  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is on the top shelf, then the remaining books (besides I) must be placed on the bottom shelf because there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, the middle shelf must have I only. 
  
  A: H, I - H is not placed on any shelf.
  B: I, L - L is not placed on any shelf.
  C: H, I, L - H and L are not placed on any shelf.
  D: I, K, L - K is not placed on any shelf.

  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
If G is placed on the top shelf, then we know that:
  - The top shelf has at least two books (including G).
  - The middle and bottom shelves each have at least three books.
  
If G is on the top shelf, then we know that F and M cannot be on the top shelf, since F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf. We also know that I is on the middle shelf, so the middle shelf must have at least two books (including I).

Option A: H, I
If H and I are on the middle shelf, then the bottom shelf must have at least four books (including O and L), and the top shelf must have at least two books (including G). This arrangement satisfies all the conditions, so it is possible.
Option B: I, L
If I and L are on the middle shelf, then the bottom shelf must have at least five books (including O), and the top shelf must have at least two books (including G). This arrangement satisfies all the conditions, so it is possible.
Option C: H, I, L
If H, I, and L are on the middle shelf, then the bottom shelf must have at least four books (including O), and the top shelf must have at least two books (including G). This arrangement satisfies all the conditions, so it is possible.
Option D: I, K, L
If I, K, and L are on the middle shelf, then the bottom shelf must have at least four books (including O), and the top shelf must have at least two books (including G). However, this arrangement violates the condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, since we do not know where F is placed.
Option E: F, I, M
If F, I, and M are on the middle shelf, then the bottom shelf must have at least four books (including O and L), and the top shelf must have at least two books (including G). This arrangement satisfies all the conditions, so it is possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O).
  - There are 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
If G is on the top shelf, then we know that F and M must be on the bottom or middle shelf. We also know that there must be at least 2 books on the top shelf, so G is not alone. 

Option A is not possible because H cannot be on the middle shelf since there are already two books on that shelf (I and either F or M).

Option B is not possible because I is already on the middle shelf and L cannot be on the middle shelf since there are already two books on that shelf (I and either F or M).

Option C is not possible because H cannot be on the middle shelf since there are already two books on that shelf (I and either F or M).

Option D is not possible because K cannot be on the middle shelf since it is on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the bottom or middle shelf.

Option E is possible because F and M can be on the middle shelf with I, and the remaining books (H, K, L, O) can be on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top shelf, middle shelf, bottom shelf
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
  - I is placed on the middle shelf
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M
  - If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf, and at least 2 books on the middle shelf.
  
Analysis:
  - If G is on the top shelf, then H, I, K, L, M, and O must be on the bottom two shelves.
  - I is on the middle shelf, so H, K, L, M, and O must be on the bottom shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F, so F must be on the middle shelf.
  - F is on the same shelf as M, so M must be on the middle shelf.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L must be on the middle shelf and O must be on the bottom shelf.
  - Therefore, the only book that could be on the middle shelf with I, H, L, and M is K.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then we have at least two books on the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  
Analysis:
  If G is on the top shelf, then we have at least two books on the top shelf. 
  We know that I is on the middle shelf, so we have at least two books on the bottom shelf.
  We also know that F is on the same shelf as M and K is on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, F, M, and K must be on the same shelf, and it cannot be the middle shelf because I is already there.
  Since O is on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  Thus, the only possible complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is I and L.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The middle shelf has at least 2 books.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  
Analysis:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are 3 books on the top shelf, and at least 4 books on the bottom shelf. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, it is not on the top or bottom shelf. Therefore, I must be on the middle shelf with at least one other book. We know that F is on the same shelf as M, but we don't know which shelf that is. We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf if F is on the middle or bottom shelf. O is on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf if L is on the middle or bottom shelf. If L is on the middle shelf, then H and G must be on the bottom shelf, which is not possible since there must be at least 4 books on the bottom shelf. Therefore, L must be on the top shelf, and H must be on the middle shelf. If F is on the middle shelf, then K must be on the top shelf, and if F is on the bottom shelf, then O must be on the top shelf. Therefore, the possible complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is I and H.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O).
  - There are 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
If G is placed on the top shelf, then we know that F and M must be on the same shelf, and they can't be on the top shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf. We also know that I is on the middle shelf, so we can conclude that the top shelf has only one book (G), and the middle shelf has at least two books (I and one of H, L, or K). 

Option A: H, I
If H and I are on the middle shelf, then L, K, F, M, and O must be on the bottom shelf. This violates the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, option A is not possible.

Option B: I, L
If I and L are on the middle shelf, then H, K, F, M, and O must be on the bottom shelf. This satisfies all the conditions, so option B is a possible list.

Option C: H, I, L
If H, I, and L are on the middle shelf, then K, F, M, and O must be on the bottom shelf. This violates the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, option C is not possible.

Option D: I, K, L
If I, K, and L are on the middle shelf, then H, F, M, and O must be on the bottom shelf. This satisfies all the conditions, so option D is a possible list.

Option E: F, I, M
If F, I, and M are on the middle shelf, then H, K, L, and O must be on the bottom shelf. This violates the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, option E is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - If G is placed on the top shelf, then G is not placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  
Analysis:
  - If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at least 2 books on the top shelf and at most 3 books on the bottom shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is not on the middle shelf, then M is not on the middle shelf either.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf if F is not.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the middle shelf if L is not.
  - Therefore, if G is placed on the top shelf, then H and L must be on the middle shelf to satisfy the conditions.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  2. If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  3. The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  4. The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
  5. The antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days.

Analysis:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. 
  According to condition 4, the table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both. Therefore, the harmonica or the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  According to condition 2, if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th. 
  According to condition 3, the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  According to condition 1, the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd.
  Therefore, the harmonica or the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd. 
  Based on the above analysis, the only option that could be true is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, it means that the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - Since the table is auctioned on a later date than the vase, the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd or June 4th.
  - Since the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror, the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd or June 4th.
  - Since the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th or June 6th.
  - Since the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st and the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd or later.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, it would contradict the condition that the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Analysis:
  - We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  - Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, since the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 1st, which contradicts the fact that the mirror is auctioned on a later date than the table.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, then the mirror must also be auctioned on the same day as the harmonica or on June 1st, which again contradicts the fact that the mirror is auctioned on a later date than the table.
  - Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 4th or on an earlier date, which again contradicts the fact that the mirror is auctioned on a later date than the table.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, which is consistent with the fact that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  - Therefore, the answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, we know that the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th. This means that the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 6th. However, this violates the condition that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 6th.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - We know the order of the antiques auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd: the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd. Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because it must be auctioned before the table or the vase.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  - The table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the sundial, harmonica, and lamp must be auctioned before the table.
  - The harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because it must be auctioned before the table or the vase.
  - The sundial is auctioned on June 2nd.
  - Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd, 4th, or 5th.
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the only possible order is: June 1st - lamp, June 2nd - sundial, June 3rd - harmonica, June 4th - vase, June 5th - mirror, June 6th - table. Therefore, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, so the answer is B.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, then the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the only possible order for these three antiques is: harmonica, mirror, lamp.
  - If the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, then it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  - If the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase, then the only possible order for these three antiques is: sundial, vase, mirror.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, it means that the table is auctioned on either June 5th or June 6th. 
From the given conditions, we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, which means it must be auctioned on either June 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th. 
Also, we know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase, which means the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. 
If the mirror is auctioned on June 3rd, then the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later. This means the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd. However, this violates the condition that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, this option is not possible.
If the vase is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 4th or later. This means the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd. This satisfies all the conditions, and therefore this option is possible.
Therefore, the answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  2. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  3. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase, which means the mirror is auctioned on a date later than the sundial.
  4. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  
Analysis: 
  Since the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, we can conclude that the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. 
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the vase and the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd and June 4th, but we don't know the order of these two antiques. The harmonica, the lamp, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, and June 6th, but we don't know the order of these three antiques either. Therefore, we cannot conclude that A, B, C, or D must be true. 
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the vase and the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd and June 4th, in that order. The harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd, but we don't know the order of these two antiques. The sundial must be auctioned on June 5th. Therefore, we can conclude that E is true.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Action: 
  - From the given conditions, we can deduce that the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, and it is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - If the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  - Since the table is auctioned after the vase, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  - Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, then the mirror must also be auctioned on one of those days, and the lamp must be auctioned on a later day.
  - Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, and it must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - Thus, the table must be auctioned on June 6th, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st.
  - Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  The table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.

Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.
  E: The toy store is in space 3.

  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in either space 4 or space 6.
  - The pharmacy cannot be in space 7 because the restaurant must be in one of the ends.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in spaces 1 and 2 or spaces 6 and 7.
  - Therefore, a restaurant must be in space 4.
  - The toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6 because it cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 3.
  - The optometrist cannot be in space 2 because the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the pharmacy is not in space 2.
  - Therefore, the shoe store must be in space 2 and the pharmacy must be in space 6.

  - Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in either space 4 or space 6 (because it must be next to the veterinarian).
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, it must be in space 6.
  - Therefore, one of the restaurants must be in space 1 (because the pharmacy must be at one end and a restaurant at the other).
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the other restaurant cannot be in space 2 or space 3.
  - Therefore, the toy store cannot be in space 2 or space 4 (because it cannot be next to the veterinarian).
  - So, the toy store must be in space 3.
  - The optometrist cannot be in space 2 (because the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian).
  - Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 7.

  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in either space 4 or space 6.
  - The pharmacy cannot be in space 7 because one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row.
  - Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 4 if the optometrist is in space 3 or in space 6 if the optometrist is in space 7.
  - The toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6 because it would be next to the veterinarian.
  - Therefore, the toy store must be in space 3 or space 7.
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, a restaurant cannot be in space 4 or space 6.
  - Therefore, a restaurant must be in space 1 or space 7.
  - If a restaurant is in space 7, then the pharmacy must be in space 6 and the optometrist must be in space 3, which means the shoe store must be in space 2 and the toy store must be in space 1. This contradicts the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - Therefore, a restaurant must be in space 1.
  - This means the pharmacy must be in space 4 and the optometrist must be in space 6.
  - The shoe store must be in space 2 and the toy store must be in space 3.

  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Eliminating options:
  Option A is not necessarily true because the optometrist could be in space 1, 3, 4, 6, or 7.
  Option B is not necessarily true because the pharmacy could be in space 1 or 2.
  Option D is not necessarily true because the shoe store could be in space 1 or 7.
  Option E is not necessarily true because the toy store could be in space 1, 2, 4, 6, or 7.

Analyzing option C:
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be in space 4 or 6.
  If the pharmacy is in space 4, then the optometrist must be in space 3 and one of the restaurants must be in space 7. This means that the other restaurant must be in space 2 and the shoe store and toy store must be in spaces 1 and 6, respectively. This satisfies all the constraints, and therefore, option C must be true.
  If the pharmacy is in space 6, then the optometrist must be in space 7 and one of the restaurants must be in space 3. This means that the other restaurant must be in space 2 and the shoe store and toy store must be in spaces 1 and 4, respectively. However, this violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The veterinarian is in space 5.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  From the constraints, we know that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7. If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2. However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the optometrist must be in space 2. Therefore, the shoe store must be in space 3, and the toy store must be in space 4. Then, the two restaurants must be in spaces 6 and 7, with the restaurant being in space 7, which is at the other end of the row from the pharmacy. Therefore, the correct answer is C: A restaurant is in space 4.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread.
  - Six colors of thread are available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  - Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.

  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Solution:
  - If forest is used in a multicolored rug, then it must be combined with either olive, peach, white, or yellow. However, olive cannot be used with forest, and peach and yellow cannot be used together. Therefore, forest cannot be used in a multicolored rug. Hence, A is true.
  - If turquoise is used in a multicolored rug, then it must be combined with either forest, olive, peach, or white. However, peach cannot be used with turquoise, and forest cannot be used with turquoise. Therefore, turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug. Hence, B is true.
  - Since peach is used in a rug with olive, it cannot be used in a rug with turquoise. Therefore, peach must be used in a rug with white or yellow. Hence, C is true.
  - Turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug, but it can be used in a solid rug. Therefore, D is not necessarily true.
  - Yellow can be used in a rug with peach, but it cannot be used in a rug with white. Therefore, yellow must be used in a rug with forest, olive, or turquoise. Hence, E is not necessarily true.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  Six colors of thread are available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Analysis:
  From the given rules, we know that forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. However, there is no restriction on using either of them in a multicolored rug. So, A and B cannot be true.
  We also know that peach is used in a rug if olive is used in that rug. So, C must be true.
  There is no restriction on using turquoise in a rug. So, D may or may not be true.
  Similarly, there is no restriction on using yellow in a rug. So, E may or may not be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread.
  - Six colors of thread are available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  - Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Solution:
  - Since each color can be used in only one rug, and there are three rugs, exactly three colors will be used in solid rugs.
  - If white is used in a solid rug, it must be used with two other colors, so the other two solid rugs will each use one color.
  - If olive is used in a solid rug, it must be used with peach, so the other two solid rugs will each use one color.
  - Therefore, the only multicolored rug must use the remaining three colors.
  - Peach cannot be used in the multicolored rug, because it is already used in a solid rug with olive.
  - Turquoise cannot be used in the multicolored rug, because it is not used with forest and peach.
  - Yellow can be used in the multicolored rug, because it is not used with peach.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:

  - If forest is used in a multicolored rug, then it must be used with two other colors. However, there are only five colors available, so forest cannot be used in a multicolored rug. Therefore, A is true.
  - Turquoise cannot be used in a rug with forest or peach, so it can only be used with olive, white, or yellow. Therefore, it is possible for turquoise to be used in a multicolored rug. B is false.
  - Since peach is used in a rug with olive, and olive is used in exactly one rug, then peach must be used in exactly one rug. Therefore, C is true.
  - Turquoise cannot be used in a rug with peach, so it can only be used with olive, white, or yellow. Therefore, it is possible for turquoise to be used in a multicolored rug. D is false.
  - Yellow can be used in a rug with olive, white, or turquoise, so it is possible for yellow to be used in a multicolored rug. E is true.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread.
  - Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Solution:
  - From the given rules, we know that forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. Therefore, they must be used in different rugs.
  - Also, peach and olive must be used together in a rug. Therefore, they cannot be used in the same rug as turquoise.
  - From the given rules, we know that in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. Therefore, white cannot be used alone in a rug.
  - From the given rules, we know that peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug. Therefore, they must be used in different rugs.
  - We can now consider the possible combinations of colors for each rug:
    - Rug 1: forest + (olive or peach) + (turquoise or white or yellow)
    - Rug 2: turquoise + (olive or peach) + (forest or white or yellow)
    - Rug 3: (white or yellow) + (olive or peach) + (forest or turquoise)
  - From the above combinations, we can see that all the given options are possible except for option B, which states that there are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used. This is not possible since we have already seen that turquoise can be used in Rug 2.

  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then U and X must be mentioned in chapters 5 and 6, but we don't know which one comes first.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in either chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. This means that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, because there would be only one chapter separating T from W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in either chapter 3, 4, or 5, and W must be mentioned in either chapter 6 or 7.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S must be mentioned in either chapter 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then U and X must be mentioned in chapters 5 and 6, but we don't know which one comes first.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in either chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. This means that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, because there would be only one chapter separating T from W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in either chapter 3, 4, or 5, and W must be mentioned in either chapter 6 or 7.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S must be mentioned in either chapter 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so X must be mentioned in either chapter 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S must be mentioned in either chapter 1, 2, 4, or 5. The only option that satisfies this condition is B, where S is mentioned in chapter 3.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The project has four years assigned to four different students.
  - Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  A: We don't know if Louis is assigned to the project or not.
  B: We don't know if Ryan is assigned to the project or not.
  C: We don't know if Tiffany is assigned to the project or not.
  D: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. That leaves only Louis and Mollie to be assigned to 1921 and 1922, but Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922 if Tiffany is not assigned to the project. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  E: If Louis is assigned to 1924, then the remaining years must be assigned to Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx. However, if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project either, which contradicts the condition "If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project." Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.

- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
- There are four years to be assigned, and each year must have exactly one student assigned to it.
- Yoshio is not assigned to the project.

Analysis:
- If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, and Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922. This means that Louis, Mollie, and Yoshio must be assigned to 1921, 1924, and 1922, respectively.
- If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. This means that Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, and neither can Onyx. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to a year other than 1923, and the remaining students must be assigned to the other years.
- If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project either. This means that Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1924. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1922, and the remaining students must be assigned to the other years.
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. This means that Louis, Tiffany, Ryan, Onyx, and Yoshio must be assigned to the other years.

  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project.
  
Analysis: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project. 
  There are four years, and each year must have exactly one student assigned to it. 
  Therefore, one of the students must not be assigned to the project.
  Let's analyze each choice:
  A: Louis not assigned to the project is not possible because Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and there are only five students available for the project.
  B: Ryan not assigned to the project is possible because if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, and there are only five students available for the project.
  C: Tiffany not assigned to the project is not possible because Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and there are only five students available for the project.
  D: Onyx assigned to 1922 is possible because if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, and there are only five students available for the project.
  E: Louis assigned to 1924 is not possible because Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and there are only five students available for the project.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - There are four years to be assigned, and each year is assigned to exactly one student.
  
Analysis:
  - If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there are five students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, the other three years (1923, 1924, and one of 1921 or 1922) must be assigned to Louis, Onyx, and Ryan/Tiffany.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923, as only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922, as 1922 is not immediately prior to 1923 or 1924.
  - Therefore, the only possible year for Onyx to be assigned to is 1922. This leaves Louis and Ryan/Tiffany to be assigned to 1923 and 1924.
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then he cannot be assigned to 1923. This means Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan must be assigned to 1924. However, this violates the condition that if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to the project.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The project has four years, and four students will be assigned to it, one for each year.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find a choice that could be true given that Yoshio is not assigned to the project. 
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. But if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project because there will not be a student available to assign to Ryan's year. Therefore, choices C and E are false.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. But if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be three students available to assign to 1921, 1922, and 1924. Therefore, it is possible that Mollie is not assigned to the project. Therefore, choice B is possible.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. But if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be three students available to assign to 1921, 1922, and 1924. Therefore, it is possible that Onyx is assigned to 1922. Therefore, choice D is possible.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available to assign to the project. Therefore, it is possible that Louis is not assigned to the project. Therefore, choice A is possible.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  We are given a set of conditions that dictate which student can be assigned to which year.
  The years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924 will each have exactly one student assigned to it.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be only five students available for the project. 
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to any year since there is no student whose year is immediately after 1920.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which is not possible since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, which means that Onyx cannot be assigned to any year.
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which is not possible since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The project has four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
- Each year has exactly one student assigned to it.
- Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
- Yoshio is not assigned to the project.

Action: 
- If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
- From the conditions, we know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Yoshio is not assigned, then Louis could be assigned to 1923.
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. However, we don't know if Mollie is assigned to the project or not, so we cannot determine if this condition applies.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. However, we don't know if Tiffany is assigned to the project or not, so we cannot determine if this condition applies.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. If Yoshio is not assigned, then Onyx could be assigned to 1922, which is the year immediately prior to Ryan's (1923).
- Therefore, the answer is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are four years to be assigned, and each year is assigned to exactly one student.
  - If Mollie is assigned, she must be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned, Ryan must be assigned.
  - If Ryan is assigned, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - If Yoshio is not assigned, there will be five students available for the project.
  
Analysis:
  - If Yoshio is not assigned, there will be five students available for the project. Therefore, one of the six students will not be assigned to the project.
  - If Louis is not assigned, then there will be only one student (Tiffany) available for 1923, which violates the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is not assigned, then there will be no student available for the year immediately prior to Onyx's, which violates the condition that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, which violates the condition that if Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  - If Mollie is assigned, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922, and Onyx must be assigned to 1920 (the year immediately prior to Louis's). Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1922, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921, and Onyx must be assigned to 1921 (the year immediately prior to Louis's). Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922, and Onyx must be assigned to 1923 (the year immediately prior to Ryan's). Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.

Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, it could be true that Ryan is not assigned to the project.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The project requires four students to be assigned to four different years, one student per year.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students left to assign to the four years. 
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices:
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. But if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must also be assigned, which means there is no one left to assign to the fourth year. So, Louis must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned either, since Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. So, Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. But if Louis is assigned to 1923, then there is no one left to assign to the year that Tiffany was supposed to be assigned to. So, Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, Ryan must be assigned to the remaining year (1921 or 1922), and Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This leaves Mollie unassigned, which violates the condition that Mollie must be assigned to the project if she is available. So, Louis cannot be assigned to 1924.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, it could be true that Ryan is not assigned to the project.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
- There are six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: 
- If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project.
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, leaving only three students available for the other three years. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to the project.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. However, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only four students available, and it is not possible to assign both Tiffany and Ryan to the project. Therefore, Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. However, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available, and it is not possible to assign both Ryan and Onyx to the project. Therefore, Ryan cannot be assigned to the project.
- If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there are still four students available for the project, and it is possible to assign one student to each year. Therefore, A could be true.
- If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, Tiffany must be assigned to 1924, and Louis must be assigned to 1921. Therefore, D could be true.
- If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, Ryan must be assigned to 1922, and Onyx must be assigned to 1921. Therefore, E could be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. M cannot be published in the same season as P.
  2. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  3. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  4. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. This means that L and P must be published in the spring. So, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring, based on condition 4. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M. Also, P cannot be published in the fall with M, based on condition 1. Therefore, P must be published in the spring with N. If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall, based on condition 3. Therefore, K and O cannot be published in the spring with M. That leaves us with L and 0 as the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  We need to find a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M.
  
Analysis: 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, so N cannot be published in the fall. Therefore, we can eliminate options B and D. 
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. However, we do not know if K is published in the fall or not, so we cannot determine if O can be published in the fall. Therefore, we cannot select option A. 
  If M is published in the fall, P cannot be published in the fall. Therefore, we can eliminate option E. 
  This leaves us with option C, L and O, which could both be published in the fall along with M. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - M is published in the fall.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  
Analysis:
  - If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be in the answer.
  - Since K and N must be published in the same season as each other, and N cannot be in the answer, then K cannot be in the answer either.
  - If M is published in the fall, then P must be published in the spring. Therefore, P cannot be in the answer.
  - If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, O cannot be in the answer.
  - This leaves us with only one possible pair: L and 0.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- M is published in the fall.
- If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
- K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
- If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
- M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.

Analysis:
- If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring.
- K and N must be published in the same season, so K cannot be published in the fall.
- If K is not published in the fall, then O cannot be published in the fall either.
- Therefore, K, O, and N must all be published in the spring.
- M and P cannot be published in the same season, so P must be published in the spring as well.
- That leaves L and 0 as the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. This eliminates choices A, B, and C.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The order of performance of the compositions must satisfy several conditions.
  - S is performed fourth.
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  A: If F is performed fifth, then T must be performed immediately before F. But this would mean that R is performed after F, which would violate the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Therefore, A is not a possible answer.
  B: If S is performed fourth, then P must be performed before S. But if L or H is performed last, then P cannot be performed before S since P must be performed before L or H. Therefore, B is not a possible answer.
  C: If O is performed first, then P must be performed after S, which would violate the condition that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Therefore, C is not a possible answer.
  D: If O is performed first, then P must be performed after S, which would violate the condition that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Therefore, D is not a possible answer.
  E: If S is performed fourth, then P must be performed before S. If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed after R, which would mean that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. If L or H is performed last, then O must be performed first. Therefore, E is a possible answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be one of the following:
  - O, P, R
  - O, P, T
  - P, R, T
  
  A: F, H, P - This cannot be the correct answer because there is no information about F, H, and R's order.
  B: H, P. L - This cannot be the correct answer because there is no information about L's position.
  C: O, P, R - This could be a possible order. O is performed either first or fifth, and P is performed before S. So, O must be performed first, and P must be performed second. Then, R must be performed after P, and T must be performed after R or before F. Since S is performed fourth, T cannot be performed before F. Therefore, T must be performed after R. This leads to the order O, P, R.
  D: O, P, T - This could be a possible order. O is performed either first or fifth, and P is performed before S. So, O must be performed first, and P must be performed second. Then, T must be performed after P and before F or after R. Since S is performed fourth, T must be performed after R. This leads to the order O, P, T.
  E: P, R, T - This could be a possible order. P is performed before S, and T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. Since S is performed fourth, T must be performed after R. Therefore, the order must be P, R, T.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed before S must be O and either F or R, and the compositions performed after S must be P and either F or R. 
  A: F, H, P - If F is performed fifth, then T must be performed immediately after R, and L or H must be performed sixth. This violates the condition that O must be performed either first or fifth.
  B: H, P, L - If H is performed eighth, then L must be performed sixth, and T must be performed immediately before F. This violates the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  C: O, P, R - This is a valid sequence of compositions. If O is performed first, then F and R must be performed fifth and sixth, and T must be performed immediately after F or immediately after R. The eighth composition can be either L or H.
  D: O, P, T - If O is performed first, then either F or R must be performed fifth, and the other one must be performed sixth. This violates the condition that T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  E: P, R, T - If P is performed first, then O must be performed fifth, and F and R must be performed sixth and seventh. This violates the condition that O must be performed either first or fifth.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions that can be performed before S are O and P.
  O is performed either first or fifth, so if O is performed before S, then the possible order of the first three compositions are:
    - O, P, F (if T is performed immediately after R)
    - O, P, R (if T is performed immediately before F)
  If P is performed before S, then the possible order of the first three compositions are:
    - H, L, O (if T is performed immediately after R)
    - L, H, O (if T is performed immediately before F)
    
Choices:
  A: F, H, P - P is performed after S, so this order is not possible.
  B: H, P. L - P is performed before S, so this order is not possible.
  C: O, P, R - This order is possible if T is performed immediately before F.
  D: O, P, T - This order is possible if T is performed immediately after R.
  E: P, R, T - P is performed before S, so this order is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The order of performance of the compositions must satisfy the following conditions:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  We are given that S is performed fourth.
  A: F, H, P - If P is performed after S, then P cannot be performed before S, so this option is not possible.
  B: H, P, L - If S is performed fourth, then P must be performed before S, so this option is not possible.
  C: O, P, R - If O is performed first, then P must be performed after O and before S, which is possible. Then, R must be performed after P and before F, which is also possible. Therefore, this option is possible.
  D: O, P, T - If O is performed first, then P must be performed after O and before S, which is possible. Then, T must be performed immediately after P or immediately before F, which is not possible since F must be performed after R. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  E: P, R, T - If S is performed fourth, then P must be performed before S, which is possible. Then, R must be performed after P and before F, which is possible. Therefore, this option is possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  3. O is performed either first or fifth.
  4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  5. P is performed at some time before S.
  6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
Since S is performed fourth, we know that P must be performed before S, so O cannot be performed first. Therefore, O must be performed fifth. Also, since the eighth composition performed is either L or H, we know that L or H must be performed seventh. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A, B, and E. 

Option C: O, P, R is not possible because P must be performed before S and S is performed fourth.

Option D: O, P, T is possible because O is performed fifth, P is performed before S, and T can be performed immediately after R.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then we know that P must be performed before S. Therefore, O cannot be performed first because there would be no way to fit P between O and S. This means that O must be performed fifth. We also know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H, so we can eliminate choices C and D because they do not include either L or H. 
  
Analysis:
  A: F, H, P - This order does not work because we know that P must be performed before S, and S is performed fourth.
  B: H, P, L - This order is possible because P can be performed before S, and L is one of the compositions that could be performed eighth.
  C: O, P, R - This order does not work because O must be performed fifth, and R cannot be performed second because there must be at least two compositions between F and R.
  D: O, P, T - This order does not work because O must be performed fifth, and T cannot be performed third because there must be at least two compositions between F and R.
  E: P, R, T - This order does not work because P must be performed before S, and S is performed fourth.
  
Action: Answer("B")

  - F _ _ _ (T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and there are at least two compositions performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Therefore, the first composition cannot be T or R)
  - _ F _ _ (T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and there are at least two compositions performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Therefore, the second composition cannot be T or R)
  - _ _ F _ (T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and there are at least two compositions performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Therefore, the third composition cannot be T or R)
  
  A: F, H, P (P is performed at some time before S, but S is performed fourth, so this is not possible)
  B: H, P, L (P is performed at some time before S, but S is performed fourth, so this is not possible)
  C: O, P, R (This is possible. O is performed first, P is performed second (before S), and R is performed third)

  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then we know that P must be performed before S. This means that O must be performed first or fifth, and since O cannot be performed fifth, then O must be performed first. This also means that the compositions performed after O and before S must be F, R, and T in some order. Since T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, then we know that the order must be O, T, F, S, and the compositions performed after S and before O must be H, L, and P in some order. Since the eighth composition performed is either L or H, then we know that the order must be O, T, F, S, P, H, L or O, T, F, S, P, L, H.
  
  A: F, H, P - This cannot be the correct answer because it does not include O, which must be performed first.
  B: H, P, L - This cannot be the correct answer because it does not include O, which must be performed first.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo and Bay 6 holds another one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay holding grain > bay holding livestock
  Bay holding livestock > bay holding textiles
  Bay holding produce > bay holding fuel
  Bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  There are six types of cargo--fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  
  To determine which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4, we need to use the given information to determine which types of cargo can be held in bay 4 and then eliminate those options from the choices.
  
  If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be bay 3 or bay 5, and the bay holding produce must be the other. If the bay holding produce is bay 5, then the bay holding fuel must be bay 4. If the bay holding produce is bay 3, then the bay holding fuel must be bay 2. In either case, the bay holding machinery must be bay 1 or bay 6, and the remaining cargo must be in the remaining bay. Therefore, the type of cargo held in bay 4 must be either fuel or machinery.
  
  A: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, grain cannot be held in bay 4.
  B: The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, livestock cannot be held in bay 4.
  C: Machinery can be held in bay 4.
  D: The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, produce cannot be held in bay 4.
  E: The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. Therefore, textiles cannot be held in bay 4.

  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  We need to find the type of cargo that CANNOT be in bay 4.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we can deduce that bay 5 must hold either grain or livestock, and bay 2 must hold either produce or fuel. Also, bay 6 must hold either textiles or machinery. Since the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, bay 5 must hold grain and bay 2 must hold produce. Therefore, bay 6 must hold textiles and bay 3 must hold fuel. Now, we know that bay 4 must hold either livestock or machinery.
  
  A: Grain cannot be in bay 4 because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and bay 5 must hold grain.
  B: Livestock cannot be in bay 4 because the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, and bay 6 must hold textiles.
  C: Machinery can be in bay 4.
  D: Produce cannot be in bay 4 because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, and bay 2 must hold produce.

  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the last remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  Bay 1, 2, and 3 cannot hold machinery, produce, or textiles because they have to hold grain, livestock, and textiles in some order.
  Bay 5 and 6 cannot hold livestock or grain because they have to hold fuel, machinery, or produce in some order.
  Bay 4 cannot hold produce because produce has to be in a higher-numbered bay than fuel, and bay 4 is the only remaining bay that can hold fuel.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  - There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  - According to the given information, the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. This means that bay 3 and bay 5 must hold produce and textiles, but it is not clear which one of them holds which cargo.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. This means that bay 4 cannot hold produce because it is between bay 3 and bay 5, which must hold produce and textiles.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. This means that bay 5 cannot hold livestock because it is next to the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. This means that bay 6 must hold grain.
  - Therefore, the only option left for bay 4 is machinery.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo, bay 2 holds another of the six types, and so on until bay 6.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Bay 4 is located between bay 3 and bay 5.
  Therefore, the type of cargo held in bay 4 must be different from the types of cargo held in bay 3 and bay 5.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  2. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of wall 3. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. This means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of wall 2. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will each display exactly two paintings (an oil and a watercolor).
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room (walls 1, 2, 3, and 4), with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. This means that Greene's watercolor must be displayed on either wall 1, 3, or 4. However, we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 4. Therefore, Greene's watercolor must be on either wall 1 or 3. We also know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so there must be an oil painting on the same wall as Greene's watercolor. The only student whose oil painting has not been placed yet is Hidalgo. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position on the same wall as Greene's watercolor. This means that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, and the answer is (C).
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student has two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. This means that Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4, since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, and the answer is (C).
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will display two paintings each (one oil and one watercolor).
  - Two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls in the room.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, then Greene's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, and in the lower position. This means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of that same wall. Since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, and we already have two paintings by Franz, Greene, and Isaacs displayed, then Hidalgo's two paintings must be displayed on the remaining wall, which is wall 3. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position on wall 3. Answer choice (C) is the only option that matches this conclusion.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Franz and Isaacs cannot have paintings displayed on the same wall.
  2. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  3. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  4. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  5. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  
Reasoning:
  - If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  - From condition 2, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil. Therefore, Greene's oil cannot be displayed in an upper position on that wall.
  - From condition 5, we know that each wall has paintings from at least two different students. Therefore, if Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then that wall would have only paintings from those two students, which violates condition 5.
  - If Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, then that wall would have only paintings from Hidalgo and Isaacs, which violates condition 5.
  - If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then that wall would have only paintings from Hidalgo and Isaacs, which violates condition 5.
  - From condition 3, we know that Isaacs's watercolor is not displayed on wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall from Isaacs's oil.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the four walls has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
To determine the answer, we need to figure out which painting belongs to Hidalgo and where it is displayed. We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of that wall. This means that Hidalgo's paintings cannot be on that wall, since no wall can have only one student's paintings. We also know that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. Therefore, the only option left is that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position on a wall that also has Isaacs's watercolor displayed on it. This means that the correct answer is (D) Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student displays exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. - It is not necessarily true.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. - It is not necessarily true.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position. - It is not necessarily true.
  D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. - It is not necessarily true.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position. - It is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students displaying two paintings each.
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then Franz's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of that wall. Therefore, neither Hidalgo nor Isaacs can have both paintings displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor. This means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position, and since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, then Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4. Therefore, the only option that must be true is that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position (choice C).
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students will display exactly two paintings each.
  - Two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then:
  - Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of a different wall.
  - Isaacs's oil must be displayed in the upper position of the same wall as Franz's watercolor.
  - Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on the remaining wall(s) that do not have paintings by Franz and Isaacs.
  - Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  
Analysis:
  - A: There is no information that determines the position of Greene's oil painting.
  - B: Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  - C: There is no information that determines the position of Hidalgo's oil painting.
  - D: Hidalgo's oil painting cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor because Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on the remaining wall(s) that do not have paintings by Franz and Isaacs.
  - E: This statement is true based on the given condition that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor, in the upper and lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors.
  - No wall has the work of only one student.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
To determine which statement must be true if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, we need to consider the possible walls where these paintings could be displayed. 

If Franz's watercolor is on wall 1, then Greene's oil must be on wall 2. This would mean that Hidalgo's paintings would have to be on walls 3 and 4, which violates the condition that no wall has only watercolors. Therefore, Franz's watercolor cannot be on wall 1.

If Franz's watercolor is on wall 2, then Greene's oil must be on wall 1. This means that Isaacs's paintings must be on walls 3 and 4, and Hidalgo's paintings must be on wall 3. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position on wall 3. This satisfies the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. 

If Franz's watercolor is on wall 3, then Greene's oil must be on wall 4. This means that Isaacs's paintings must be on walls 1 and 2, and Hidalgo's paintings must be on wall 1. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position on wall 1. This satisfies the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. 

If Franz's watercolor is on wall 4, then Greene's oil must be on wall 3. This would mean that Hidalgo's paintings would have to be on walls 1 and 2, which violates the condition that no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, Franz's watercolor cannot be on wall 4.

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position. Therefore, the answer is (C) Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.

  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the optometrist and the shoe store must occupy two consecutive spaces.
  
Analysis:
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the order of the businesses must be one of the following:
    1. optometrist, shoe store, ?, ?, ?, ?, pharmacy/restaurant
    2. ?, optometrist, shoe store, ?, ?, ?, pharmacy/restaurant
    3. pharmacy/restaurant, ?, ?, ?, optometrist, shoe store, ?
    4. pharmacy/restaurant, ?, ?, ?, ?, optometrist, shoe store
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Thus, the order of the businesses must be either 1 or 4.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Thus, the order of the businesses must be 1.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Thus, the order of the businesses must be 1 with the two restaurants separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Thus, the order of the businesses must be 1 with the toy store not next to the veterinarian.
  - Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store must be the pharmacy and a restaurant.

where X, Y, and Z are the shoe store, optometrist, and veterinarian (in some order).

If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then we have:
Pharmacy - Restaurant - Shoe Store - Optometrist - Restaurant - Y - Z

The only possible options for Y and Z are the toy store and the veterinarian, but the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, we must have:
Pharmacy - Restaurant - Shoe Store - Optometrist - Restaurant - Toy Store - Veterinarian

So, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair are the restaurant and the toy store.

  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the optometrist and the shoe store must occupy spaces 2 and 3 in some order.
  
  A: The pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian if the optometrist and the shoe store occupy spaces 2 and 3. Also, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be next to the shoe store. Thus, A is not correct.
  B: The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. If the optometrist and the shoe store occupy spaces 2 and 3, then the pharmacy must occupy space 1 or space 4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the only option is for the pharmacy to occupy space 1 and the toy store to occupy space 4. Thus, B is correct.
  C: The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. If the optometrist and the shoe store occupy spaces 2 and 3, then there are only three spaces left for the other businesses: spaces 1, 4, and 5. There is no way to place two restaurants in these three spaces with at least two other businesses between them. Thus, C is not correct.
  D: The toy store must occupy space 4 if the optometrist and the shoe store occupy spaces 2 and 3. Thus, D is not correct.
  E: The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. If the optometrist and the shoe store occupy spaces 2 and 3, then the pharmacy must occupy space 1 or space 4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot occupy space 5. Thus, E is not correct.

  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then there are only two possible locations for the optometrist and the shoe store: (1) spaces 1 and 2 or (2) spaces 6 and 7.
  
Analysis:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store in spaces 1 and 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 3 or 7. If the pharmacy is in space 3, then the veterinarian must be in space 4 or 6, which would be next to the toy store, violating the constraint. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7, and the veterinarian must be in space 6. The two restaurants must be in spaces 4 and 5, and the toy store must be in space 3. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store in spaces 1 and 2 are the pharmacy and the toy store.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  2. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  3. Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  4. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  5. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  6. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  7. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  1. Since exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, there are a total of 9 batches of cookies (3 batches/kind x 3 kinds).
  2. Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, there are at most 2 batches of cookies made each day.
  3. If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are a total of 8 batches of cookies made from Monday to Thursday.
  4. Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, there is only one batch of sugar cookies made from Monday to Wednesday.
  5. Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, there are at most 2 batches of cookies made on Monday. This means that the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday (choice A is false).
  6. Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday (choice D is false).
  7. Since the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on a different day than the second batch of oatmeal cookies, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday (choice B is false).
  8. This leaves only choices C and E as possibilities.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the bakery must have made two batches of cookies on Thursday. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the bakery must have made one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies on Thursday. Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must have been made on Wednesday. Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must have been made on Tuesday. This means that the third batch of oatmeal cookies must have been made on Friday. Thus, the only choice that could be true is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are two possibilities:
    1. One batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
    2. One batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Friday.
  - We need to check which of the given statements is possible in each of the above cases.
  - A cannot be true because the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday or Thursday.
  - B cannot be true because the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday or Friday.
  - C cannot be true because the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday.
  - D cannot be true because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday or Friday.

Knowledge:
  1. There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  2. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  3. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  4. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  5. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  6. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there must be a total of 8 batches of cookies made from Monday to Friday. 
  From condition 5, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on a day earlier than the second batch of oatmeal cookies. Hence, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday or Thursday. 
  From condition 6, the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on a day earlier than Thursday. Hence, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday or Friday. 
  From condition 3, there cannot be two batches of the same kind of cookie made on the same day. Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday or Wednesday. 
  From condition 4, at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday. 
  Therefore, the only possible option is that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. Hence, the answer is C.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  2. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  3. Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  4. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  5. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  6. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  7. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, the only way to have exactly three batches of each kind of cookie is to have one batch of oatmeal cookies, one batch of peanut butter cookies, and one batch of sugar cookies made on Friday.
  The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and it is not a batch of sugar cookies.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is not made on Tuesday.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies can be made on Friday because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.

  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are two batches made on Thursday.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
  - No two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday or Thursday.
  - Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday or Wednesday.
  - If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday or Thursday, which is not possible.
  - Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  - If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday, which is possible.

Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. - This is not possible because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on a day other than Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday. - This is not possible because the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Tuesday, which violates the rule that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. - This is possible because the first and second batches of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday and Wednesday (in some order), and the third batch of oatmeal cookies can be made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. - This is not possible because the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.

  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one.
  
Analysis:
  - We know that there are three batches of each kind of cookie made each week, so there must be a total of 9 batches made.
  - We know that at least one batch is made on Monday, so there are 8 batches left to be made.
  - We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so those two batches must be made on the same day.
  - We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so there are only 2 batches left to be made on Friday.
  - Since there can only be one batch made on Friday, there must be two batches made on one of the other days.
  - We can eliminate option A since the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday since there are already batches of other cookies being made on Monday.
  - We can eliminate option B since the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - We can eliminate option C since the third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday since there are only two batches left to be made on Friday.
  - We can eliminate option D since the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.

  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.

  - Since each kind of cookie has three batches, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, each day must have one batch of each kind of cookie.
  - We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first and third batches of sugar cookies must have been made on Monday and Wednesday, respectively.
  - We also know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday, as that is when the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?
Choices:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
  C: the sci-fi film, the western
  D: the western, the horror film
  E: the western, the mystery
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Elimination:
  - Choice A: The western should begin before the horror film, so this cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening. Eliminate A.
  - Choice B: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it should be shown on either screen 1 or 2. This is a possible list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening. Keep B.
  - Choice C: The western should begin before the horror film, so this cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening. Eliminate C.
  - Choice D: This is a possible list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening. Keep D.
  - Choice E: The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so this cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening. Eliminate E.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
Analysis:
  Since screen 2 shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M., the movie that is shown at 9 P.M. must be either the horror film or the mystery. Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, the movie that is shown at 7 P.M. on screen 2 must be either the sci-fi film or the western. The western begins at some time before the horror film does, so the western must be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 2 and the horror film must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2. Therefore, the romance cannot be shown on screen 2. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 2. This means that the mystery must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1. Therefore, the only possible accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first, is "the sci-fi film, the western".

  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.

Analysis:
  We need to determine which of the given options CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.
  Option A: The sci-fi film, the horror film - This option is possible since the horror film can start after the western.
  Option B: The sci-fi film, the mystery - This option is possible since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Option C: The sci-fi film, the western - This option is possible since the western can start before the horror film.
  Option D: The western, the horror film - This option is possible since the western can start before the horror film.

  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation:

Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies showing at the repertory theater: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  According to the conditions, the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so if one of them is shown on screen 2, then the other one cannot be shown on screen 2. 
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it cannot be part of the list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does, so if the western is shown on screen 2, then it must be shown at 7 P.M. and the horror film must be shown at 9 P.M.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or 2. 

Action: Answer("B")  
  If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M., then the mystery cannot be shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M. because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 cannot be "the sci-fi film, the mystery".
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies showing at the repertory theater: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find a list of movies that CANNOT be shown on screen 2. 
  We know that the romance is not shown on screen 2, so we can eliminate any list that includes the romance.
  We also know that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so we can eliminate any list that includes both the horror film and the mystery.
  We know that the western begins at some time before the horror film does, so we can eliminate any list that includes the horror film before the western.
  We know that the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so we can eliminate any list that includes the sci-fi film on screen 3.

Action: Answer("B") 
  The list "the sci-fi film, the mystery" cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening, because the mystery cannot be shown on the same screen as the horror film, which means it cannot be shown on screen 1 either. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The shopping center has exactly seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the businesses in spaces 3 and 5 must not be the toy store or the veterinarian (since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian). Therefore, the businesses in spaces 3 and 5 must be the two restaurants, the optometrist, or the pharmacy. However, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row (according to the constraints), so it cannot be in spaces 3 or 5. Therefore, the businesses in spaces 3 and 5 must be the two restaurants or the optometrist. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the optometrist must be in space 2 or 6. However, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, which means that choice B is true.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 spaces in a straight row, numbered 1 through 7.
  - There are 7 businesses: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Analysis:
  - The pharmacy must be at either space 1 or space 7, and one of the restaurants must be at the other end.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so there are only two possible arrangements: R _ _ R _ _ _ or _ _ _ R _ _ R.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the pharmacy cannot be at space 1 if the optometrist is at space 2 or at space 7 if the veterinarian is at space 6.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be at space 3 or space 5.
  - The shoe store is at space 4, so it must be next to either a restaurant or the pharmacy.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The shoe store is in space 4.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Based on the constraints, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and the restaurant must be at the other end. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7. If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the restaurant must be in space 7 and the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 2. However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian must be in space 6 and the toy store in space 5. This leaves spaces 3 and 4 for the two restaurants, but they must be separated by at least two other businesses, which is not possible. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7, the restaurant in space 1, and the optometrist or veterinarian in space 6. Since the shoe store is in space 4, the only remaining space for the veterinarian or optometrist is space 5, which means the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, Answer B is correct.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end and one of the restaurants at the other end.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: Since the shoe store is in space 4, we know that the pharmacy is either in space 1 or space 7. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 3 or space 5. However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 3, and the optometrist must be in space 5. This means that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, so (B) is true.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end and one of the restaurants at the other end.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: 
If the shoe store is in space 4, then the businesses in spaces 3 and 5 must be determined. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so neither restaurant can be in space 3. Therefore, restaurant must be in space 7. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it must be in space 1. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist must be in space 2 and the veterinarian in space 3. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 5. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, making choice B the correct answer.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The shoe store is in space 4.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Elimination:
  A: The optometrist cannot be in space 3, since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the optometrist cannot be next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy cannot be in space 1, since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 2, and the veterinarian must be in space 1 or space 3. Thus, B is true.
  C: The toy store cannot be in space 3, since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, a restaurant cannot be next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is in space 4, so it cannot be next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is in space 4, so it cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - A shopping center has seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The shoe store is in space 4.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, the restaurant that is not at the end of the row must be in space 7.
  Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the optometrist and the veterinarian must be in spaces 2 and 6, in some order.
  Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7, and the veterinarian must be in space 2 or 6. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian.
  Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the toy store must be in space 3 or 5.
  Therefore, the shoe store is not next to the toy store, and it must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. So, the only option that must be true is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. Answer("B").
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The shopping center has exactly seven spaces in a straight row.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7.

  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
If the shoe store is in space 4, the businesses in spaces 3 and 5 must not be the toy store or the veterinarian because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 3 or 5, and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the pharmacy cannot be next to the toy store or the veterinarian, it must be next to the optometrist. Therefore, the optometrist is either in space 2 or 6. Because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, neither of the restaurants can be in space 1 or 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 3, and one of the restaurants must be in space 7. Since the pharmacy is next to the optometrist, the veterinarian must be in space 2, and the toy store must be in space 6. Therefore, the shoe store is not next to the veterinarian or the toy store. The only option that must be true is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, so the answer is B.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We are looking for a pair of colors that cannot be used in two solid rugs.
  Solid rugs are woven in a single color.
  We have six colors: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be three colors used in total.
  The colors of the two solid rugs cannot be used in the same multicolored rug.
  Therefore, the three colors used must be unique to each rug.
  
  A: forest and peach cannot be used together in a multicolored rug, but they could be used in two different solid rugs. Incorrect.
  B: forest and yellow cannot be used together in a multicolored rug, but they could be used in two different solid rugs. Incorrect.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  We are looking for two colors that cannot be used in solid rugs.
  There are six colors available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  
Analysis:
  Let's first identify the colors that cannot be used together in a rug:
  - Forest and turquoise
  - Peach and turquoise
  - Peach and yellow
  
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug. This means that at least three colors will be used in the multicolored rug. Let's consider the possible combinations of three colors that can be used in the multicolored rug:
  - White, olive, and peach
  - White, olive, and turquoise
  - White, olive, and yellow
  - White, peach, and turquoise
  - White, peach, and yellow
  - White, turquoise, and yellow
  - Olive, peach, and turquoise
  - Olive, peach, and yellow
  - Olive, turquoise, and yellow
  - Peach, turquoise, and yellow
  
  We know that the two solid rugs cannot use the same color. Therefore, we need to consider all possible pairs of colors that can be used in solid rugs:
  - Forest and olive
  - Forest and peach
  - Forest and turquoise
  - Forest and white
  - Forest and yellow
  - Olive and peach
  - Olive and turquoise
  - Olive and white
  - Olive and yellow
  - Peach and turquoise
  - Peach and white
  - Peach and yellow
  - Turquoise and white
  - Turquoise and yellow
  - White and yellow
  
  We need to eliminate the pairs of colors that include one of the colors that cannot be used together in a rug. We also need to eliminate the pairs of colors that include white, since white can only be used in a multicolored rug. The remaining pairs of colors are:
  - Forest and olive
  - Olive and yellow
  - Peach and white
  - Turquoise and white
  
  We need to check if any of these pairs of colors can be used in solid rugs. The only pair that cannot be used in solid rugs is Peach and white. Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find two colors that cannot be used together in two solid rugs.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
  If we assume that the multicolored rug has all six colors, then each of the solid rugs must have two colors.
  We can use the given rules to eliminate the choices that cannot be used together in two solid rugs.
  
  A: forest and peach cannot be used together in a rug because olive must be used with peach, but forest and olive cannot be used together.
  B: forest and yellow can be used together in two solid rugs because neither of them violates any of the given rules.
  C: peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug because peach and turquoise cannot be used together in any rug.
  D: peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug because peach and yellow cannot be used together in any rug.
  E: turquoise and yellow can be used together in two solid rugs because neither of them violates any of the given rules.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are six colors of thread available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  We are asked to find the two colors that cannot be used in the solid rugs.
  
Analysis:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  If white is used in the multicolored rug, then two other colors must be used as well. 
  If olive is used in one of the solid rugs, then peach must also be used in that rug.
  If forest is used in one of the solid rugs, then turquoise cannot be used in that rug.
  If peach is used in one of the solid rugs, then yellow cannot be used in that rug.
  Therefore, the two solid rugs cannot have the following combinations of colors:
    - forest and turquoise
    - peach and yellow
  This means that the answer is either A or B.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:

  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  Exactly two of the rugs are solid.
  
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  If a color is used in the multicolored rug, it cannot be used in any of the solid rugs.
  If a color is used in a solid rug, it cannot be used in the other solid rug or in the multicolored rug.
  
  A: forest and peach can be used in different rugs. For example, forest can be used in a solid rug with olive, peach, turquoise, and white; and peach can be used in another solid rug with forest, olive, turquoise, and yellow.
  B: forest and yellow can be used in different rugs. For example, forest can be used in a solid rug with olive, peach, turquoise, and white; and yellow can be used in another solid rug with forest, olive, peach, and white.
  C: peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug, but they can be used in different rugs. For example, peach can be used in a solid rug with forest, olive, turquoise, and white; and turquoise can be used in another solid rug with forest, olive, peach, and white.
  D: peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, but they can be used in different rugs. For example, peach can be used in a solid rug with forest, olive, turquoise, and white; and yellow can be used in another solid rug with forest, olive, peach, and white.

  The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  There are exactly two solid rugs.
  
Analysis:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each of the five colors will be used in exactly two rugs. 
  We need to check which two colors cannot be used together in a solid rug.
  If we use forest in a solid rug, then we cannot use peach in any of the two solid rugs, because forest and peach cannot be used together in any rug.
  If we use yellow in a solid rug, then we cannot use peach in any of the two solid rugs, because peach and yellow cannot be used together in any rug.
  Therefore, the colors of those two rugs CANNOT be forest and peach (Option A) or peach and yellow (Option D).
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are six colors of thread available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five colors will be used to weave the rugs.

  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Analysis:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug. 
  Let's consider the possible pairs of solid rugs:
  - Forest and Peach: If we use forest and peach in two solid rugs, then we cannot use olive, turquoise, and yellow in any of the rugs. This leaves us with only two colors (white and forest) for the multicolored rug, which violates the rule that in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. Therefore, forest and peach cannot be used in two solid rugs.
  - Forest and Yellow: If we use forest and yellow in two solid rugs, then we cannot use olive, turquoise, and peach in any of the rugs. This leaves us with only two colors (white and forest) for the multicolored rug, which violates the rule that in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. Therefore, forest and yellow cannot be used in two solid rugs.
  - Peach and Turquoise: If we use peach and turquoise in two solid rugs, then we cannot use olive, yellow, and forest in any of the rugs. This leaves us with only two colors (white and turquoise) for the multicolored rug, which violates the rule that in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. Therefore, peach and turquoise cannot be used in two solid rugs.
  - Peach and Yellow: If we use peach and yellow in two solid rugs, then we cannot use olive, turquoise, and forest in any of the rugs. This leaves us with only two colors (white and yellow) for the multicolored rug, which violates the rule that in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. Therefore, peach and yellow cannot be used in two solid rugs.
  - Turquoise and Yellow: If we use turquoise and yellow in two solid rugs, then we cannot use olive, peach, and forest in any of the rugs. This leaves us with only two colors (white and turquoise) for the multicolored rug, which violates the rule that in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. Therefore, turquoise and yellow cannot be used in two solid rugs.

  If Verma is the project leader, then Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Wells is not a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.
  Therefore, the project members must be selected from the group {Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Xue}.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member. Therefore, the project members must be selected from the group {Quinn, Smith, Taylor}.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then that person must be the project leader. Therefore, the project members must be selected from the group {Quinn, Ruiz} and the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz.

Action: Answer("D")  
  If Smith is not selected, then Taylor is not a project member. Therefore, the project members must be selected from the group {Quinn, Xue, Wells}. In this case, Verma could be the project leader.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have 3 members and 1 leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
  Therefore, the only way Verma can be the project leader is if Smith is not a project member.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The project leader must be one of the three project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Verma must be one of the three project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  Therefore, the three project members must be chosen from Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, and Xue.
  If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then neither Smith nor Taylor can be a project member. Therefore, Verma cannot be a project member, and thus Verma cannot be the project leader.
  If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader. Therefore, Verma can be the project leader.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then she must be one of the three members. 
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. So, Wells cannot be a member. 
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be. So, Smith and Taylor must be members. 
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a member, then they must be the leader. So, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a member. 
  Therefore, the remaining members are Xue and Verma, and Verma is the leader. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Elimination:
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be, so if Smith is not selected, then Taylor cannot be the project member.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, so if Verma is the project leader, then Wells cannot be the project member. 
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member because Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. 
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then the other one cannot be a project member because exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members. 
  Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be the other two project members because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. 
  Wells cannot be a project member because if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. 
  
Conclusion:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Quinn or Ruiz, Smith, and Taylor must be the project members, and Wells cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, the only option that satisfies this condition is (C) Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then the other two members cannot be Ruiz or Quinn. This is because Ruiz or Quinn can only be a project member if they are leading the project. Therefore, Verma cannot be a project member if Ruiz or Quinn is the leader. 
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, Smith and Taylor must be the other two project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, Wells cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, the only possible combination is Verma as project leader, Smith and Taylor as the other two project members, and none of the other workers being selected.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then she must be one of the three project members selected. 
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then he must be the project leader. Therefore, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member.
  We have already determined that Wells cannot be a project member. Therefore, the three project members must be Smith, Taylor, and Xue.
  Since Verma is not one of the three project members, she cannot be the project leader if any of the three project members are selected.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The project will have 3 members, one of whom will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, so Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, Taylor cannot be a project member, and thus cannot be the project leader. This means Verma cannot be the project leader. 
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, so Smith and Wells must be project members. However, since neither Ruiz nor Taylor can be selected, Quinn must be the project leader. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, so Wells must be a project member. Since neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member if Wells is selected, Quinn must be the project leader. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected, so Wells must be a project member. Since neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member if Wells is selected, Quinn must be the project leader. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, so Smith must not be a project member. Therefore, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member, and thus neither of them can be the project leader. Therefore, Verma could be the project leader.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then she must be one of the three selected workers.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Verma cannot be a project member if Wells is selected.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if Smith is a project member and Taylor is not.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then he must be the project leader. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if Quinn or Ruiz is a project member and not the project leader.
  Therefore, Verma could be the project leader only if Smith, Wells, Quinn, and Ruiz are not selected.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The project leader must be one of the three selected workers.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member. This is because Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. So, if Verma is the project leader, then the other two project members must be selected from Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. So, if Verma is the project leader, then the other two project members must be selected from Taylor, Wells, and Xue. 
  
Action: Answer("E")  
  If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then Verma can be the project leader and the other two project members can be selected from Smith and Xue.

  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  From the given rules, we know that J must be shown in the evening, and K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. Also, L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon, and M must be shown in the evening or morning.

Action: Answer("E")

  The realtor will show seven houses during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  We know that J must be shown in the evening, so it cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  Since L must be shown in the afternoon or evening, and K must be shown before L, it follows that K must be shown in the afternoon and L must be shown in the evening.
  M must be shown after L, so it cannot be shown in the morning.
  
Action: Answer("E")

  J must be shown in the evening. 
  K cannot be shown in the morning. 
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. 

A: K cannot be shown in the morning. So, K cannot be shown in the evening as well, which contradicts the given rule that the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. So, L cannot be shown in the afternoon as it would violate the given rule that the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, B cannot be true.
C: J must be shown in the evening. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. So, L must be shown in the evening after J is shown and before M is shown. Therefore, C must be true.
D: M must be shown in the afternoon as the first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, and L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, D cannot be true.
E: M must be shown in the afternoon as the first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, and L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, E must be true.

  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Analysis:
  We know that J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be one of the first two houses to be shown in the morning.
  We also know that K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be one of the third, fourth, or fifth houses to be shown in the afternoon.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L cannot be the first or second house to be shown in the morning, and it cannot be the sixth or seventh house to be shown in the evening.

Analysis:
  We know that J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be one of the first two houses shown.
  We also know that K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be one of the houses shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  Since L must be shown before M, L cannot be shown in the afternoon because M is the last house to be shown in the afternoon.

  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J is either the sixth or seventh house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K is either the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house to be shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. This means that L must be shown in the afternoon or evening, and M must be shown in the afternoon or morning.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  Based on the rules, we know that J must be shown in the evening, so J is either the sixth or seventh house to be shown. 
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K is either the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house to be shown. 
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. This means that L must be shown in the afternoon or evening, and M must be shown in the afternoon or morning. 
  Since L must be shown before M, and M cannot be shown in the morning, M must be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, the correct answer is E: M is shown in the afternoon.

  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  
Analysis:
  We know that J must be shown in the evening, so K cannot be shown in the evening. Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon. Since L must be shown after K and before M, and K is shown in the afternoon, L must also be shown in the afternoon. This means that M must be shown in the evening, since it is the only remaining house to be shown and the evening is the only time left.

Action: Answer("E")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that either Jaramillo or Landon must be assigned to the remaining ambassadorship to Zambia. However, the question does not provide any information about Jaramillo or Landon being assigned to any particular country. Therefore, we cannot determine which country Jaramillo is assigned to, and it is possible that Jaramillo is not assigned to any ambassadorship. Thus, the only option that must be true is that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, which is answer choice D.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
- Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.

Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, because Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to different countries. Therefore, Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Landon is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong is not assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  
  A: We cannot conclude this from the given information.
  B: We cannot conclude this from the given information.
  C: We cannot conclude this from the given information.
  D: We cannot conclude this from the given information.
  E: This must be true based on the given information.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. Therefore, either Jaramillo or Landon will be assigned to the remaining ambassadorship. However, if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship, which is not possible since Kayne is already assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned to an ambassadorship, which means that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship. Hence, the correct answer is D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. Thus, if Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then only Landon and Ong are left to be assigned as ambassadors. However, if Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it must be to Zambia, which means that Ong cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship, and this contradicts the fact that there are three ambassadorships to be assigned. Therefore, Jaramillo must not be assigned to an ambassadorship, which means that the answer is D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, because if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen, based on the constraint that "If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen." Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, because if Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships, and we already know that Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. Therefore, the only conclusion that must be true is that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship. 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Analysis: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship. 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia. 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that Jaramillo has to be assigned to one of the remaining two ambassadorships, and if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship. Since Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia, but we don't know if Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship. We also don't know if Ong is assigned to an ambassadorship.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to another country.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned as ambassador, then it must be to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to another country. However, it is not specified which country Jaramillo will be assigned to. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Jaramillo will be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Zambia, or any other country. Thus, the correct answer is D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Action: Answer("B")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, the only remaining country for Landon to be assigned as ambassador is Zambia. Thus, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to any country, Kayne is assigned as ambassador to that country.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship. Therefore, if Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then the remaining ambassadors (Landon, Novetzke, and Ong) can be assigned to the remaining two countries, Zambia and Venezuela.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are six solos, one for each member of the band.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  If the saxophonist performs the third solo, then the percussionist must have performed before the saxophonist, and the keyboard player must perform after the saxophonist and before the guitarist. This would mean that the violinist would perform before the saxophonist, which is not allowed. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Elimination:
  We know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so they cannot perform the third solo either.
  The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so they cannot perform the third solo.
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, so they can perform the third solo.
  The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, so they can perform the third solo.
  The trumpeter can perform the third solo because they perform before the saxophonist.
  The only option left is the violinist, so they CANNOT perform the third solo.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: 
  We know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  We also know that the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo.
  We know that the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform either the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.
  If the saxophonist performs the third solo, then the percussionist must perform the first solo, the violinist must perform the second solo, and the keyboard player must perform the fourth solo, which violates the restriction that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.
  Answer: (C) saxophonist
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Let's consider the options one by one:
  A. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so he can perform the first, second, or third solo.
  B. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. So he can perform the second or third solo.
  C. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. So he can perform the first, second, third, fifth, or sixth solo.
  D. The trumpeter can perform the fourth, fifth, or sixth solo. But the question asks which one cannot perform the third solo, so this option is incorrect.
  E. The violinist can perform the first or second solo.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  The third solo can be performed by either the percussionist, the saxophonist, or the trumpet player, since they can perform a solo before the keyboard player does, and after the violinist does. The guitarist cannot perform the third solo, since he does not perform the fourth solo. The violinist cannot perform the third solo, since the keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does. Therefore, the answer is not A or E. The saxophonist can perform the third solo, since he can perform a solo after the percussionist does. Therefore, the answer is not C. The only option left is D, the trumpeter.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  There are six members in the band, and each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  If the keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does, then the violinist must perform before the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist or after the trumpeter.
  Since the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, then the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  If the guitarist performs the first or second solo, then the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist, which is not allowed. Therefore, the guitarist must perform the third solo.
  Thus, the answer is not the guitarist, so A is not the answer.
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, so B is not the answer.
  The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, so C is not the answer.
  The trumpeter can perform either the fourth, fifth, or sixth solo, so D is not the answer.
  The violinist performs before the guitarist, so E is not the answer.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Solution:
  - By the given restrictions, the order of the solos can be determined as follows:
    1. percussionist
    2. trumpeter or saxophonist
    3. saxophonist or trumpet player
    4. violinist
    5. keyboard player
    6. guitarist
  - The third solo can be performed by either the saxophonist or the trumpeter.
  - Therefore, the answer is not A, B, D, or E.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are six members in the band, each of them performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  Based on the restrictions, we can create a timeline of the order of the solos. The percussionist must perform before the keyboard player, and the saxophonist must perform after either the percussionist or the trumpeter. The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, and the keyboard player must perform after the violinist and before the guitarist. Therefore, the order of the solos must be: Percussionist, Trumpeter or Saxophonist, Violinist, Keyboard Player, Saxophonist or Trumpeter, and Guitarist. This means that the third solo must be performed by the violinist, and none of the other members can perform the third solo.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The first solo can be performed by any of the six members.
  - The second solo can be performed by any of the five remaining members.
  - The third solo can be performed by any of the four remaining members.
  - The fourth solo can be performed by any of the three remaining members, but not the guitarist.
  - The fifth solo can be performed by any of the two remaining members.
  - The sixth solo can be performed by the remaining member.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist can perform the third solo only if either the percussionist or the trumpeter performs the second solo. However, the second solo can be performed by any of the five remaining members, and none of them is the percussionist or the trumpeter. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The third solo must be performed after the percussionist and before the guitarist.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the fourth solo must be performed by the violinist.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does, so the keyboard player must perform the second solo.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. So, the saxophonist must perform either the first or the fifth solo.
  - Therefore, the only option left for the third solo is the trumpeter.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
- There must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes.
- There must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

Analysis:
- A cannot be true because there is no information about Fuentes' photographs in the Metro section.
- B cannot be true because there is no information about Gagnon's photographs in the Metro section.
- C cannot be true because there must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes.
- D could be true, as there is no information about Hue's photographs in the Sports section.
- E cannot be true because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have two photographs in the Lifestyle section and one in the Sports section. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and Hue already has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must have two photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. (Choice B)
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) should have exactly two photographs.
  - Each photographer should have at least one but no more than three photographs.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then we know that the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes (because of the constraint that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section). Therefore, there can be no other photographs by Gagnon in the Metro section, and exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. So, the answer is B.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs will appear in the newspaper, exactly two photographs per section.
  - The available photographs were taken by three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then we know that the third photographer, Fuentes, must have both of his/her photographs in the Metro and Sports sections. This is because we need at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and we know that neither Gagnon nor Hue have a photograph in the Metro section. Also, we know that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, so if Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must also have one photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon (since Gagnon has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, and at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by a photographer who has a photograph in the Lifestyle section). Thus, the answer is B.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, Sports) has to have exactly two photographs, and each photograph is taken by one of the three photographers.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. However, since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and there must be at least one photograph by each photographer in the Sports section, it follows that exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Fuentes. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section must also be by Fuentes. So, choice B is the correct answer.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) should have exactly two photographs.
  - Each photographer should have at least one photograph, but no more than three in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes. Since each section must have exactly two photographs, and we already know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the other four photographs must be divided between the Metro and Sports sections. However, none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so both of Gagnon's photographs must be in the Metro section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Answer: B
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) will have exactly two photographs.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
  - There must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes.
  - There must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes.
  - There cannot be any photograph by Gagnon in the Sports section.
  
  A: It is not necessarily true.
  B: It is not necessarily true.
  C: It cannot be true because Gagnon cannot have any photograph in the Sports section.
  D: It is not necessarily true.
  E: It is not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - 6 photographs in total, 2 per section in 3 sections.
  - 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photographs.
  - At least one photograph in Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro section.
  - Number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. This is because at least one photograph in Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro section. Since Gagnon and Hue are already in Lifestyle, Fuentes must be in Metro. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) should have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and Hue already has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be two. Therefore, Fuentes must have exactly one photograph in the Metro section, which means exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Thus, the answer is B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon and the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes. This is because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon, and exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. Thus, the answer is B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then we know that two batches of cookies were made on Monday, and that no batches of oatmeal, peanut butter, or sugar cookies were made on Tuesday or Wednesday. Therefore, we know that at least one batch of oatmeal cookies, one batch of peanut butter cookies, and one batch of sugar cookies were made on Thursday and Friday. We also know that the second batch of sugar cookies was made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must have been made on either Monday or Tuesday. This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies must have been made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must have been made on Friday. With this information, we can determine which of the answer choices must be true.

Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Friday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. This means that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, and exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. Therefore, we can conclude that answer choice B must be true.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Each week, the bakery makes exactly 9 batches of cookies (3 kinds of cookies x 3 batches each).
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The bakery operates from Monday to Friday.
  
Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the only possible configurations for the batches of cookies are:
  Monday: 1 batch
  Tuesday: 3 batches
  Wednesday: 0 batches
  Thursday: 2 batches
  Friday: 3 batches
  
  or
  
  Monday: 1 batch
  Tuesday: 2 batches
  Wednesday: 0 batches
  Thursday: 3 batches
  Friday: 3 batches
  
  If the first configuration is true, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday (choices A and B are false). At most one batch of cookies is made on Monday (choice C is false) and at most one batch of cookies is made on Thursday (choice D is false). Therefore, the answer is E.
  
  If the second configuration is true, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday (choices A and E are false). At most one batch of cookies is made on Monday (choice C is false) and at most one batch of cookies is made on Thursday (choice D is false). Therefore, the answer is B.

  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made either on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday. 
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Monday, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. 
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday, which leaves only Friday for the third batch of peanut butter cookies, and violates the condition that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week. 
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, then the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, which leaves only Friday for the third batch of peanut butter cookies, and violates the condition that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday, which means the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. This leaves Monday for the third batch of sugar cookies, and Wednesday for the third batch of oatmeal cookies.

Topic: Law
Context: A teacher will assign each of five students—Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga—to exactly one of two research teams, the green team and the red team. One team will have two members, and the other will have three members. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator. The assignment must satisfy the following conditions: Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Kelly is not a facilitator. Olga is a facilitator.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
  B: Lateefah is a facilitator.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are two teams: green and red.
  - One team has two members and the other has three members.
  - One member of each team is a facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members.
  - Olga is assigned to the green team and is a facilitator, so the green team has two members who are not facilitators.
  - Juana is assigned to the red team and is not a facilitator.
  - Mei's team assignment is not specified, but since there are only two teams, Mei must be assigned to the red team.
  - Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams, one with two members and the other with three members.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members and the red team must have two members. Therefore, the members of the green team are Lateefah, Olga, and one other person. The members of the red team are Juana, Kelly, and one other person. Since Olga is a facilitator, she cannot be on the same team as Kelly. Therefore, Kelly must be on the red team, and Juana must be on the green team. Since Kelly is not a facilitator, the other member of the red team must be the facilitator. Since Juana is on the green team, Mei must be on the red team. Therefore, Mei and Kelly are both on the red team, and neither of them is a facilitator.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams: one with two members and the other with three members.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team has three members and the red team has two members.
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the team with two members, which is the red team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so she must be assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the green team.
  Mei is the only one left and must be assigned to the red team.
  Therefore, Lateefah and Kelly are not facilitators, Juana is assigned to the green team, Olga is assigned to the red team, and Mei and Olga are both facilitators.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are two teams: the green team and the red team.
  - One team has two members and the other has three members.
  - One member of each team is a facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Analysis:
  - Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members.
  - Olga is a facilitator, so she must be on the team with two members, which is the red team.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so Juana must be on the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator, so she cannot be on the same team as Olga, who is a facilitator.
  - Mei is the only person left, so she must be on the red team with Olga.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, and there are only two teams, the other team must have two members and Olga must be assigned to it since she is a facilitator. Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the red team since she cannot be on the same team as Olga. Kelly is not a facilitator, so she cannot be on the same team as Olga either. Mei can be on either team, but we don't know if she is a facilitator or not. Therefore, D and E are not necessarily true. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  Two research teams: green team and red team.
  One team has two members and the other has three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Since Olga is a facilitator, she must be on a team with either Lateefah or Mei. If Juana is on the same team as Olga, then Mei and Lateefah must be on the other team, but Lateefah is assigned to the green team, so Juana must be on the red team. Therefore, Juana and Mei are both on the red team, and neither of them is a facilitator.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  Two teams: green team and red team.
  One team has two members and the other has three members.
  One member of each team is a facilitator.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Analysis:
  From the given information, we know that Lateefah is assigned to the green team, and Olga is a facilitator. Therefore, Olga must be the facilitator of the green team. Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga, Juana must be assigned to the red team. This means that the red team has two members, and Mei must be the other member of the red team. Since Kelly is not a facilitator, Kelly must be a member of the green team. Therefore, Lateefah and Kelly are members of the green team, and Lateefah is not a facilitator. This leaves Mei as the facilitator of the red team.

Action: Answer("A")  
The statement "Juana is assigned to the red team" must be true.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams, one with two members and one with three members.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members, and the red team must have two members.
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Kelly cannot be assigned to the green team.

  One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members and the red team must have two members.
  Since Olga is a facilitator, she must be on the green team.
  Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, Juana must be on the red team.
  Since Kelly is not a facilitator, she cannot be on the green team.
  Therefore, Kelly must be on the red team.
  Mei is the only student left and must be on the green team.
  Therefore, Mei is a facilitator and Juana is not a facilitator.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The green team has Lateefah and two other members.
  The red team has two members, one of whom is Olga.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  
Analysis:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team, so the green team has Lateefah and two other members. This means the red team has Juana, Kelly, and Olga.
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be on the red team. Therefore, Juana is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Mei must be the other facilitator on the green team.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are both facilitators, so D is not true.

Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show 7 houses during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  Since J must be shown in the evening, it is not possible that K is shown at some time after J is shown. Therefore, A is false.
  Since L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, it is possible that L is shown at some time after J is shown. Therefore, B could be true.
  Since J must be shown in the evening, and P is the last house to be shown, it is possible that P is shown at some time after J is shown. Therefore, C could be true.
  Since N and O are not mentioned in the problem, it is impossible to determine whether they are shown at some time after M is shown. Therefore, D is false.
  Since K cannot be shown in the morning and P is the last house to be shown, it is impossible for both N and P to be shown at some time after K is shown. Therefore, E is false.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses to a prospective buyer during a single day, with specific rules for when each house can be shown.

  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.

Analysis:
  A: If K is shown at some time after J is shown, then J cannot be shown in the evening as required, so this option is not possible.
  B: L must be shown at some time after K is shown, so if L is shown after J, then K must be shown in the morning and J in the evening, which is possible.
  C: P can be shown at any time during the day, so this option is possible.
  D: Both N and O are not mentioned in the rules, so this option is possible.
  E: Both N and P cannot be shown at the same time after K, as there is only one slot for the houses to be shown in the evening, so this option is not possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class, Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building, but it is not enough information to determine if it is a must be true statement.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings, but it is not enough information to determine if it is a must be true statement.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp, it is possible but not necessary for Southco to make a trade with Trustcorp to make Trustcorp own no class 2 buildings.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower, it is not possible for Trustcorp to own the Garza Tower because it is a class 1 building.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House, it is possible for Trustcorp to own the Zimmer House after a trade with RealProp where Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for RealProp's class 3 Zimmer House.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp cannot trade any of its class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded one or both of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings, so it cannot trade one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building, so it can trade one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  If Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp, then Southco must have received at least one class 2 building from Trustcorp, which contradicts the given information that Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  Therefore, Southco has not made any trades with Trustcorp.
  Trustcorp cannot own the Garza Tower because it is a class 1 building owned by RealProp.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, so it cannot own the Zimmer House, which is a class 3 building owned by RealProp.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  A: RealProp owning a class 1 building is not necessarily related to Trustcorp owning class 2 buildings.
  B: If Southco owns only class 2 buildings, then it must have traded its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings and traded its class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, which means Trustcorp must own at least one class 2 building, so this cannot be true.
  C: If Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp, then Trustcorp must own at least one class 2 building, so this cannot be true.
  D: If Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower, then it must have traded one of its class 2 buildings for a class 1 building, which means it still owns at least one class 2 building, so this cannot be true.
  E: If Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House, then it must have traded one of its class 2 buildings for a class 3 building, which means it still owns at least one class 2 building, so this cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings will not result in Trustcorp owning any class 2 building.
  RealProp owns one class 1 building.
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp cannot trade any of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either one building of the same class or one class 1 building and one class 3 building. 
  If Trustcorp traded one class 2 building for a class 1 building, then RealProp must own a class 1 building. 
  If Trustcorp traded one class 2 building for a building of the same class, then Trustcorp still owns two class 2 buildings, which contradicts the given statement. 
  If Trustcorp traded one class 2 building for a class 3 building, then RealProp must own two class 3 buildings, which contradicts the given information. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded one class 2 building for a class 1 building and a class 3 building, and RealProp must own a class 1 building. 
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns 1 class 1 building and 2 class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns 1 class 1 building and 1 class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns 3 class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. Since each trade involves only one building, Trustcorp must have made at least three trades. If Trustcorp traded all of its class 2 buildings, then it cannot have traded any class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded its class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings or for other class 2 buildings. 
  
  A: There is no information in the question to support this statement.
  B: There is no information in the question to support this statement.
  C: If Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp, then Trustcorp cannot own only class 1 and class 3 buildings. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  D: If Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower, then RealProp must own either the Yates House or the Zimmer House. If RealProp owns the Yates House, then RealProp owns two class 3 buildings, which is not possible. Therefore, RealProp must own the Zimmer House. This means that RealProp owns one class 1 building, which is the Garza Tower. Therefore, this statement is true.
  E: If Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House, then RealProp must own the Garza Tower and the Yates House. This means that RealProp owns two class 3 buildings, which is not possible. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
  A: We do not know if RealProp owns a class 1 building or not. It is not necessarily true that RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). It is not necessarily true that Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco may or may not have made at least one trade with Trustcorp. We do not have enough information to determine if Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. It is not necessarily true that Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). It is not necessarily true that Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  If Trustcorp traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings, then Southco must have traded its class 2 building with Trustcorp. This would mean that Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp. However, this does not guarantee that Southco owns only class 2 buildings, so option B is not necessarily true.
  If Trustcorp traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings, then RealProp must have traded one of its class 3 buildings with Trustcorp. This means that RealProp owns a class 1 building. Therefore, option A must be true. 
  The other options are not necessarily true based on the given information.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings, then Southco cannot own only class 2 buildings, because it does not own any class 1 buildings. Thus, B is not true.
  If Trustcorp traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings, then RealProp must own a class 1 building, because there are only two class 1 buildings in the scenario. Thus, A must be true.
  We cannot determine whether Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp, because there is no information about the trades between Southco and Trustcorp.
  We cannot determine whether Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower or the Zimmer House, because there is no information about the trades involving these buildings.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
  A: It is not clear whether RealProp owns a class 1 building or not. It is possible for RealProp to own a class 1 building or not own one.
  B: Southco owns only two buildings, one of which is class 2. Thus, Southco cannot own only class 2 buildings.
  C: It is not clear whether Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp or not. It is possible for Southco to have made a trade with Trustcorp or not.
  D: Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Therefore, Trustcorp cannot own the Garza Tower, which is class 1.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House, which is class 3. Therefore, Trustcorp cannot own the Zimmer House, which is class 3.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  RealProp owns two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means that Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded its class 2 buildings with either RealProp or Southco. Since Southco only owns one class 2 building, it means that Southco has not traded any class 2 building with Trustcorp. Therefore, Southco still owns a class 2 building. Hence, the correct answer is B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.

  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, Vegemite cannot perform in slot six.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots two and three, in some order. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, which are slots four, five, and six. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. Therefore, Vegemite must perform in slot one, and Zircon must perform in slot two. This leaves Uneasy to perform in slot five. Therefore, Zircon performs in slot two, which is answer choice D.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are six slots numbered one through six.
  - Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—will perform in the slots.
  - Each band will perform in just one slot.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
To satisfy the constraints, we know that:
  - Yardsign performs in slot one, two, or three.
  - Vegemite performs in slot two, three, four, five, or six.
  - Zircon performs in slot three, four, five, or six.
  - Wellspring performs in slot two, three, or four.
  - Xpert performs in slot three, four, five, or six.
  - Uneasy performs in slot four, five, or six.

If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then we know that:
  - Wellspring performs in slot two or three.
  - Xpert performs in slot four or five.

A: If Uneasy performs in slot five, then Zircon must perform in slot six, which violates the constraint that Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. So, Uneasy cannot perform in slot five. Eliminate A.

B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot six, which violates the constraint that Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. So, Vegemite cannot perform in slot three. Eliminate B.

C: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Xpert must perform in slot five, which violates the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. So, Wellspring cannot perform in slot three. Eliminate C.

D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then Wellspring must perform in slot one, which violates the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. So, Zircon cannot perform in slot two. Eliminate D.

E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then Xpert must perform in slot six, which violates the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. So, Zircon cannot perform in slot four. Eliminate E.

Therefore, none of the choices could be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Landon
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Novetzke
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Reasoning:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Jaramillo must also be assigned as an ambassador. In this case, Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. Therefore, Novetzke will be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. So, the other two ambassadors assigned would be Jaramillo and Landon. If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then Jaramillo must also be assigned as an ambassador. In this case, Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned would be Jaramillo and Novetzke.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. Landon is assigned to Zambia if he is assigned to any ambassadorship. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, Novetzke must be assigned to the remaining country. 

Action: Answer("A") 
  The other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne and Novetzke must be assigned to Zambia and Yemen, but we don't know which one goes to which country. Since Landon is assigned to Zambia, Jaramillo must be assigned to Venezuela. Therefore, the answer must include Landon, Kayne or Novetzke, and none of them can be assigned to Venezuela.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This means that Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador, then Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to one of the other two countries. This leaves only one country for Landon and Novetzke, so one of them must be assigned to Yemen. Since only one of Kayne or Novetzke can be assigned as ambassador, the other must be assigned to Zambia. Therefore, the possible assignments are Jaramillo and Novetzke to Yemen and Zambia, respectively.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  - Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, if Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - Landon can only be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, the remaining ambassadorship must be assigned to one of the other three candidates: Jaramillo, Kayne, or Novetzke.
  - Since Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen, and Landon can only be assigned as ambassador to Zambia, the only remaining option is to assign Novetzke as ambassador to Yemen.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, so Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. So, the remaining two ambassadorships will be assigned to Jaramillo, Landon, or Novetzke.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne will be assigned to two of the ambassadorships.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, Landon will be assigned to the remaining ambassadorship.
  So, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon. Answer choice A is correct.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must be assigned to the other. Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela and Zambia in some order. Finally, either Novetzke or Kayne must be assigned to Yemen. Therefore, Novetzke must be assigned to the remaining country, which is either Venezuela or Zambia.

Action: Answer("B") - Jaramillo and Novetzke
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
- One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
- Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.

Action: 
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia or Yemen. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must be assigned to that country too. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned to Venezuela or Zambia. Landon must be assigned to Zambia. Therefore, Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen. 
Answer: (B) Jaramillo and Novetzke.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must be assigned to one of the other ambassadorships.
  Landon must be assigned to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  Therefore, the only possible combination is Jaramillo and Landon for the remaining two ambassadorships.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Zambia. Since Landon is assigned to Zambia, Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned would be Jaramillo and Novetzke.

  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Solution:
  - Since Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and no breed is featured on any two consecutive days, Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 2. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  - Since no breed is featured on any two consecutive days, Himalayans cannot be featured on day 6. Therefore, option B is not possible.
  - Since Himalayans are not featured on day 1, they can only be featured on days 2-6. Therefore, option C is possible.
  - Since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, they cannot be featured on days 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, option D is not possible.
  - Since no breed is featured on any two consecutive days, Newfoundlands cannot be featured on day 5. Therefore, option E is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")

  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Greyhounds are featured on day 1, it means no breed can be featured on day 2.
  - Also, since no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days, it means Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 3. Therefore, Greyhounds must be featured on day 1, and not on day 3.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, which means Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, which means they can only be featured on days 2, 3, and 4 or days 3, 4, and 5.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, which means if Himalayans are featured on days 2, 3, and 4, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4. If Himalayans are featured on days 3, 4, and 5, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 3 or day 5.
  
Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation: 
  - Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6, which is possible since no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days, and none of the other conditions rule out this possibility.

B: Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Therefore, Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7. This choice is not true.
C: Himalayans are featured on exactly three days and not on day 1. Therefore, Himalayans can only be featured on days 2, 3, and 4. Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers can only be featured on days 1, 5, 6, and 7. Thus, Rottweilers and Himalayans cannot both be featured on day 4. This choice is not true.
D: Manx cannot be featured on days 4, 5, and 6 because Himalayans are not featured on these days and Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Manx can only be featured on days 2 and 7. Rottweilers can only be featured on days 1, 5, 6, and 7. Thus, Rottweilers and Manx can both be featured on day 5. This choice could be true.
E: Newfoundlands cannot be featured on days 5 and 6 because no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, Newfoundlands can only be featured on days 2, 3, 4, and 7.
